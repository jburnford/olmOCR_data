I 1945 and I believe I omitted to put her name on the form last quarter.\n\n60 John Wilfred Snowshoe was sent down from McPherson by his father along with his two brothers. The doctor has examined him and passed him but the father has not yet been in town to sign the application forms. We will forward them as soon as signed.\n\nThe hope of a school at McPherson has influenced our numbers from there this year. There was a great deal of sickness in the school last year which was of a T.B. nature. We refused a number of old pupils on this score and other children were not returned to us for the same reason. We are pleased to be able to say that this year we are free from this type of trouble in spite of epidemics of communicable diseases.\n\nThere are more children of school age at McPherson than can be accommodated in this school and the day school there. When next Sept., arrives there will be some difficulty in deciding who should come here and who stay up there. Who should decide this? The Family Allowance puts Education on a sort of compulsory basis. Who is to do the compelling? No one wants to send their children away from home to attend school. Someone should be delegated to say who is to attend the day school and who attends the Residential. There was a police constable at McPherson last summer. He if he were there again might be a favourable person or the Indian Agent could perhaps do so when he is down at Treaty time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJanuary 31, 1945\nALL SAINTS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AJIWIKIN N.B.\n\nList of Day Pupils\n\nQuarter Ending December 31 1945\n\nAngus Edwards I\nGeorge Edwards I\nDavid Husky I\nJohn Firth IBI\nLazarus Firth IBI\nJohn Velus IBI\nAnnie Edwards I\nSophia Velus I\nGladys Kee I\nMaureen Phillips W\nShirley Semler WW\nBeverly \" WW\nFrederick \" WW\nHerschel Kwatum W\nSusie Husky I\nRuth Greenland II\nLouisa Greenland II\nIrene \" II\nAstrid Garland W\n\nYou will note that there is an ever growing number of day pupils as the people are becoming more conscious of the need of schooling.

Due to parental neglect the father was persuaded to return him to us which he did January 20, 1946.\n\nGeorge was only away half a year. We did not think it necessary to file new admission forms with your office. If it is we will comply. However there are numerous reasons why we have not done this.\n\nWe asked for his discharge and it had only reached us when he was returned so I set him on the Admission and Discharge sheet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPerhaps this never reached you.

VOLUME .........................\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith returns from the Indian Day schools at Moosehide, Selkirk, Whitehorse and Champagne Landing, for the quarter ending March 31st, 1911, the same having just been delivered to me by Bishop Stringle.\n\nI note that Mr. C.C. Brett, the missionary at Champagne Landing, has, through inexperience, made the error of including in his report (submitted on two sheets) the names of 18 Indians who had been entered on his roll but who did not attend a single day during the quarter. The Bishop has informed me that he has instructed Mr. Brett not to repeat this error in future returns. The 18 Indians mentioned though they had been enrolled, were not...\nin the locality during the past quarter,\nyou are no doubt aware of the fact that\nthe Indians of this Territory do not, as a\nrule, remain in the same locality throughout\nthe year. This accounts for the marked\nirregularity of nearly all those attending\nthe day schools, also for the fact that many\nbeyond the school age of 15 (mentioned in\nthe printed instructions on the Departmental\nReturn) come to these schools, as they have\nprobably had no earlier opportunity to\nattend school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.G.

In my application, I stated that we had a church and cabin situated on this piece of land.\n\nSince writing the above I have visited the location, and find that there a number of Indian cabins situated on the said site in addition to our church and cabin. I do not know that this will make any difference in my application for the land. Our Mission is established at this place for the purpose of helping the Indians, the day school being now conducted by the Rev. C.C.Brett for the Indian children. If my application for the purchase of land is allowed, it will not interfere in any way with the buildings erected by the Indians. Mr. Chambers who formerly applied for this piece of land, tells me that at the time of his application, there were no buildings.\nDIOCESE OF YUKON\n\nDawson, Yukon, Canada\n\nSec. D.I.A.\u20143\u2014\n\nwhatever on the site, and when each of the Indians wished to erect a cabin, Mr. Chambers says that he informed them that the land would not belong to them. I mention this now, so that you may understand the position, and so that there may be no complication afterwards.\n\nI hope you will be able to grant my application for the purchase of this land at the rate of two dollars an acre.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\n\n438559\nOttawa, April 5, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 14th ultimo, referring to letter of the 24th June last, making application for the purchase of a portion of Lot 2, Group 15, Yukon territory, for church purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg leave to say that this letter has not been received by the Department, and it is unable to identify the land to which you refer.\n\nUpon advice as to the reserve upon which the land in question is situate, and a description of the portion required for church purposes, along with the consent of the Indians, permission to occupy and use the land could be given, to continue as long as the same is used for church purposes.\n\nI may say that grants to religious bodies on Indian reserves are not made by the Department, but simply with the consent of the Indians permission is given to hold a portion of a reserve as long as the same is used for church purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour most obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

In reply I wish to state that my letter of date of March 14th was addressed to your Department by mistake; it should have been addressed to the Secretary, Department of Interior, it was a question which Mr. Rowat was taking up and I am now writing the Department of the Interior on the subject.\n\nI apologize for the mistake and the trouble I have given you, and beg to remain yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon.\nChampagne Landing - over 9 (Sept 1926) - $75.00\nLittle Hudson - over 5 (Sept 1926) - $75.00\nRampart House - over 8 (June 1923) - $90.00\nStewart Point - over 7 (Dec 1923) - $77.00\nTishie Lake - over 17 (Sept 1926) - $87.00\n\nTotal pays:\nJune 1923 - Sept 1923\nSept 1923 - Dec 1923\nDec 1923 - June 1924\n\n$684.00\n\nMorehead & Selkirk\nover 10 months\nopen throughout the whole school year\n$870 plus rent of $50 a month\nover 8 - involvement $20\nOttawa, October 27th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your recent letters enclosing returns showing the attendance at Champagne Landing, Little Salmon, Rampart House and Teslin Lake Schools. The Department is allowing payment at the rate of $3.00 a day for each day that the above schools were open during the quarters for which returns were forwarded. I have compiled the following information from our files:\n\n| School            | Average Attendance | Quarter       |\n|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Champagne Landing | Aver.9 (Sept. 1926)| June quarter  |\n| Little Salmon     | Aver.5 (Sept. 1926)| Sept.         |\n| Rampart House     | Aver.8 (March 1925)| Dec.          |\n| Teslin Lake       | Aver.17 (Sept. 1926)| Sept.        |\n\nThe average attendances at these schools are comparatively small and they are open at such infrequent intervals that it is doubtful if the Department obtains any real value for the expenditure incurred. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your careful consideration and let me have your views. Possibly it might be advisable for you to discuss the future of these schools with His Lordship Bishop Stringer.\n\nWhen your reply is received, the Department will be in a position to decide what our future policy towards these schools should be.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nMemo for File:\n\nBishop Stringer informs me that the Tealin Lake and Champagne Landing Indian Summer Schools will be fairly regularly conducted. It is possible that the work might be worth while at only one of these two points for any particular season, as the Indians move back and forth. I assured him that the $5.00 per item rate would be allowed on receipt of returns.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 27th, file No 364097, also your of same date, file No 500193-3, in reference to the Indian day schools in this Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Bishop of Yukon's Secretary has been notified that the Department is allowing payment, at the rate of $3.00 per day, for each day that the schools at Champagne Landing, Little Salmon, Rampart House and Teslin Lake were open during the quarters for which returns were forwarded and that no grant would be made for the Shingle Point Eskimo day school in view of the fact that only two pupils were taught during the period the school was open.\n\nRegarding these schools being in operation at such infrequent intervals I may say that the chief reason is, the Indians are usually away during the winter months scattered in small parties in their hunting and trapping grounds. During the short summer they usually gather together in their various villages. It has been the custom of the Bishop to engage the services of students to come north to teach these Indians during the time they are all together in their villages. This entails considerable expense but the Bishop feels that he ought to do something towards giving the Indians some little education. Whether such intermittent teaching is of any real value is open to question, very little progress is possible under such conditions, it leads one to doubt whether the expenditure is justifiable.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Bishop did not bring in these students the Indians would get absolutely nothing in the way of education. It is only with the aid of the Department's grants that His Lordship is able to do this.\n\nReferring to the question as to whether the Department gets value for the expenditures incurred my reply is, I do not think it does, at the same time one feels that the Indians should be given some opportunity of acquiring the art of reading and writing.\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon is in Toronto for the winter, he will, no doubt, visit the Department before he returns north.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

May I ask if you will please be kind enough to advise me of the Department's policy in regard to the working of the schools in question in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st ultimo, relative to the arrangement made with His Lordship the Bishop of Yukon in connection with the Indian day schools in the Yukon.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as the teachers at Moosehide and Selkirk are qualified, and the schools conducted regularly, the Department will allow salary for the ten teaching months at the rate of $110 per month. Payment of rental formerly allowed will be discontinued.\n\nRelative to the other schools where the work is seasonal, the Department agreed to pay a per diem rate of $3 for the days these schools are in operation.\n\nThe work at Rampart House and Old Crow Village is linked together, and these schools should be fairly regular all the year round. It is the intention to have the regular missionary teach in one or other throughout the year, and he will be assisted by native workers at both schools. It is the intention of His Lordship to use the graduates of Carcross for this purpose.\n\nRelative to Ross River and Little Salmon, His Lordship stated that the work at these points is linked together and is bound to be more regular, and will be conducted only during the summer.\n\nThe work at Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing will be fairly regularly conducted. We understand that the Indians move from one point to the other.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRelative to Herschell Island, or Shingle Point, the last return shows an average attendance of only two pupils, and this was considered hardly sufficient to warrant our grant. If, however, the returns show later that there is a regular attendance during the period the school is conducted, the Department will allow a per diem rate the same as stated above in the case of the other schools.\n\nThe quarterly returns from all these schools should be prepared by the teachers and forwarded through your office in the regular manner. It is hoped that in all cases the teachers will prepare and forward their returns to you as promptly as mail facilities will permit.\n\nI regret that quite inadvertently this information was not directed to you at an earlier date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

All returns are promptly mailed from this office as soon as they come to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nJ.D.

I have therefore to inform you that the Department will be unable to provide any grant towards the salary of the teachers at the following schools conducted under your auspices in the Yukon territory, viz.:\n\nTeslin Lake,\nWhitehorse,\nRampart House,\nChampagne Landing.\n\nThe only day schools in the Yukon territory for which the Department can provide a grant for teachers' salaries are Mooshide and Selkirk. Mr. Superintendent Hawksley is being informed accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Arthur Sovereign, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of the Yukon,\nDawson, Yukon.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the following students from the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B.C. have been sent in to take charge of the three seasonal Indian day schools in the Yukon Agency.\n\nMr. S. W. Semple..Teslin Lake from June 1st, 1933.\nMr. W. Valentine..Champagne Landing from May 16th, 1933.\nMr. R. C. W. Ward..

F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNote for File:\n\nIndian Superintendent Hawksley advised by official letter of June 19th, 1933, that no grant would be provided towards teacher's salary at CHAMPAGNE LANDING during the fiscal year 1933-34.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am informed by Mr. Coldrick, Financial Secretary for the Diocese of Yukon, that your Department has written to the effect that you will be unable to provide any grant towards the salaries of the teachers at the following schools conducted under the auspices of the Church of England in Yukon Territory, namely Teslin Lake, Whitehorse, Rampart House and Champagne Landing.\n\nThe supervision of the work in Yukon has undergone several changes, and therefore I feel that I should take it upon myself as Archbishop or Metropolitan to write you. The Rt. Rev. A.H. Sovereign who succeeded me as Bishop of Yukon has been transferred to the Diocese of Athabasca and Bishop Geddes of Mackenzie River is supervising the work for the time being. However he has not had the opportunity of getting acquainted with the condition of affairs.\n\nI therefore write to you as representing Yukon in a general way, and I wish to ask you to reconsider the question of discontinuing the grants to the above named places. You will understand that in some cases preparation has to be made a long time ahead. For example two students have been already sent in to Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing, and their expenses have been paid, and by this time they will be pretty well on through their Summer's work. It is impossible to curtail this expense to any great extent, and I hope you will be able to give the grant especially to these two places.\n\nThe Anglican Church has been endeavoring to co-operate with the Indian Department for the benefit of the Indian children in Yukon. Some one has to make preparations for these schools; as I have mentioned above the preparations have to be made some time in advance. Bishop Sovereign made all arrangements for the carrying on of the work this Summer the same as other Summers with the expectation that the Indian Department would stand by us in helping out in connection with this important work.\n\nI wish to ask therefore if you will kindly reconsider the question and make allowance for these schools for the Summer months of 1933. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bishop Sovereign and also to Bishop Geddes.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 16, 1933.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 5th instant, regarding the providing of a grant towards the salary of the teachers of the Indian Day Schools in the Yukon Territory conducted under the auspices of the Church of England and requesting especially that the grant be provided in the case of the Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing Schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to say our Appropriation for Indian Education was so reduced this year that it was necessary to discontinue grants for salaries to a number of the Indian schools in the northern districts of Canada. As the schools at Teslin Lake, Champagne Landing, Whitehouse and Rampart House are in operation during the summer months only, it was considered, in reviewing the work which would have to be dropped this year, that, among other of our northern schools, the grant could be discontinued in the case of the four mentioned above in the Yukon. However, in view of Your Grace's representations that, before the notice of discontinuing the grants had been received, arrangements had been made to send two students to Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing and that their expenses had been paid, the Department, upon reconsideration, will continue the grant towards salaries at these schools for the period they are open during the present summer months.\n\nThe local Indian Superintendent at Dawson is being informed of the Department's decision. He is being requested to have the teachers at the two schools mentioned prepare and forward to his office a report showing the attendance, days taught, etc. When these returns are received by the Department, cheques in payment for the teachers' services will be sent.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMost Rev. I. O. Stringer, M.A., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter of June 19th, last, regarding the discontinuing of the grant towards teachers' salaries at Teslin Lake, Whitehorse, Rampart House and Champagne Landing. A communication has been received from Most Reverend I. O. Stringer, D.D., Archbishop of Rupert's Land, stating that before notice was received that the grants would be discontinued arrangements had been made to send in to Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing two students and that their expenses had already been paid. In view of this, it has been decided to continue the grant in the case of these two schools for the period they are open during the present summer months.\n\nI would request that you arrange with the teachers, after the closing of the schools for the summer period, to prepare returns, showing attendance, days taught, etc., on the usual forms for that purpose and to forward them to the Department, through your office. A cheque in payment of the grant due for salaries will then be sent. His Grace is being informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge yours of the 16th ult., and to thank you very heartily for your kindness in allowing the grants for Teslin Lake and Champagne Day Schools in Yukon for the present Summer months.\n\nYou will also have had a letter from Bishop Sovereign, a copy of which he has sent to me. This is the transition period for Yukon so far as the position of Bishop is concerned. This is the reason you have heard from Bishop Sovereign who has just resigned and it is quite possible you may hear from Bishop Geddes who is now Commissary for Yukon. I think you will see by Bishop Sovereign's letter that your action in continuing these grants was entirely justified.\n\nAgain thanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDiocese of Athabasca\n\nBISHOP\nRIGHT REV. ARTHUR H. SOVEREIGN, M.A., D.D.\nPEACE RIVER, ALBERTA\nCANADA\n\nAugust 21st, 1933.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of June 19th, File #166-12-1, has been forwarded to me from Yukon, in reference to Grants to Indian Day Schools in Yukon.\n\nI have been transferred from Yukon to Athabasca this Spring, but all the arrangements for the Indian Day Schools in Yukon had been completed by me before I left the Far North. I am very sorry that your Department has made this ruling and I trust that it is not too late to rescind it, for it works a very great hardship on the Church of England in Yukon and to the Indian wards, for which we along with you are jointly responsible.\n\n1. This summer term of three or four months is the only time for the education of the Indian boys and girls. During the summer months, they come into these central Posts with their parents, and they are thus together in one place. For many years, the Church of England has sent into these districts qualified Missionaries and Teachers, some of them University Graduates and some of them Medical Students of the higher years. In an intensive training, these Teachers have given to the Indians a knowledge of the written and spoken English, a training in simple Arithmetic, a knowledge of the rules of health and sanitation, a love for their Country and their Empire and a true Loyalty to their Empire's King. Moreover, they are taught the Ten Commandments and a knowledge of God, so that they might grow up into law-abiding Citizens. Surely such a training is beyond estimation.\n\n2. Again, may I state that the Church of England is the only Church in all of Yukon doing this work. The other Churches in a fine manifestation of sportsmanship have recognized that the Church of England was first on the ground and was also doing the work with care and efficiency, and have therefore left the work ENTIRELY to us. There is no overlapping. Your Department has always recognized this and has always loyally supported the work by Grants per capita, a fair and reasonable basis of apportionment. The work is being done on behalf of the wards of your Department; it is being done efficiently; surely you would not take away this small and necessary assistance which you have given us in the Past.\n\n3. I would emphasize the Medical side of the work. At Teslin, Rampart House and Champagne, our Teachers sent in each year, really\nact as Doctors and First aid men, and have rendered valuable aid in the caring for the sick, and first aid to those who have been injured in accidents. For many years, our Teacher at Champagne has been a Medical Student, in the persons of Dr. Herschel Stringer and Dr. Wilfred Stringer, each returning for a three year period. In 1932, Dr. Wilfred Stringer saved a man's life, ill from blood poisoning, who certainly would have died without the skilful treatment which he received from this Teacher. In fact, the Natives had already prepared a coffin for the sick man. Do you not think that a work such as this should not go unrecognized by the Department of Indian Affairs, especially when it is being done at so small a cost to the Department.\n\n4. The cost of this service to the Indians as given by the Church is very great. I trust that you will recognize this in your consideration of the whole problem. These Student-teachers are brought out in the month of May from Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver, and in September their fares are paid to their respective Colleges and homes. This matter of transportation alone is one of great expense, for the distances are great and the rates are high. It is along way from Toronto to Champagne and Teslin. We also give to each man a salary of $225.00 for the summer, pay their board and provide a lodging place. We greatly need the assistance of the Department in these heavy expenses, for they are incurred by the Church in serving the Wards of the Department. Your Department pays for the erection of the Buildings for the Indian Boarding Schools, and also gives a per capita Grant for the food and clothing of the Indians at those Schools. Why then take away the Grant for the education of the children in these isolated Posts who are not able to go to the Boarding Schools, for their accommodation is very limited? Please do not make it hard and almost impossible to care for these less fortunate Children, who are not able to enter these splendid Boarding Schools.\n\n5. Come with me to the first named place, Teslin Lake, a journey of over 200 miles from Whitehorse. Here for three years, we have sent Mr. S.W.Semple, B.A. He comes from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. We pay his fare from Vancouver to Skagway, from Skagway to Carcross by rail, from Carcross to Atlin by Plane, and there hire an Indian Guide to take him over the long trail to Teslin. Here for four months, he labours in this isolated Post among these Indians. They have only six mails a year. He holds School every weekday for the full day, with the exception of Saturday, and he has a Class of forty (40) pupils. Three nights a week are given up to the Adult Education Class attended by twelve (12) older Young People who study simple Book-keeping, letter writing etc. Services are held on Sunday attended by the whole tribe. The only Education received by the members of this Tribe has been given by the Church of England assisted by your Department, and this work has gone on for many years. In Ottawa, the children of the City are given a first class education by the State. Why should not the State at least assist in the education of these Canadian children in the Far North? It covers only four months in the year.\n\n6. As to the efficiency of the work done, I would humbly ask you for opinions from Mr. Hawksley, the Indian Agent, Col. Allard of the R.C.M.P. and Mr. Drury of the Trading Firm of Taylor.\nand Drury at Whitehorse, who visits these Posts each year. May I say that I have personally visited these isolated Posts and have lived for as long as two weeks in their midst and am able to know from personal contact of the work done.\n\n7. Finally, may I say that I as usual depended on the Department of Indian Affairs and in April prepared to place in these Posts Teachers as in years past. They are now on the field, for I did not receive any word whatever from the Department as to any reduction in Grants, least of all a cancellation. I trust that you will see the fairness of an appeal for the usual Grants for this year, and with returning prosperity already in sight, that it will not be necessary for you to cancel or even reduce the usual Grants made on behalf of this very important work\u2014the education and training of these Indian Wards, body, mind and soul,\u2014for whom we are all equally responsible.\n\nI therefore humbly ask for a reconsideration of the whole problem and I do sincerely trust that it may be possible for you to continue these Grants, not only for this year, but for the coming years.\n\nI wish also to thank you and your Department for the sympathetic and reasonable assistance which you have given to the Church of England in the discharge of these necessary duties during these many years past,\u2014services of a most valuable and necessary character, for which all citizens of Canada are equally responsible.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W. Souriquy.\nOttawa, September 7, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to grants allowed for Indian day schools in the Yukon. The Appropriation for Indian Education was so reduced this year, that it was necessary to discontinue grants for salaries to a number of the Indian schools in the northern districts of Canada. However, in view of your representations that, before notice had been received regarding the discontinuing of the grants, arrangements had been made to send teachers to certain schools in the Yukon, the Department has decided to continue the grant towards the salary at these schools for the period they are open during the summer of 1933. The local Indian Superintendent at Dawson has been so informed.\n\nIt would be advisable for you to communicate with the Department early next March in order to ascertain if it has been found possible to provide grants for the summer of 1934. Unless you are advised by the Department that funds are available, you should not expect that a grant will be provided for 1934.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Arthur H. Sovereign, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca,\nPeace River,\nAlta.\nRev. John Hawksley,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Y. T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am obliged to you for the information you passed on to me today that the Department of Indian Affairs, taking into consideration the representation made to them by Archbishop Stringer on behalf of this Diocese, had reconsidered the decision made not to allow any grant this year in respect of Indian Day Schools (with the exception of those of Selkirk and Moosehide), and would favourably consider applications on behalf of the schools that have been conducted at Teslin and Champagne this summer.\n\nThis is most welcome news at a time when the Diocese is experiencing great difficulty in maintaining the teachers throughout its large extent and it will be greatly appreciated both by Archbishop Stringer and the Commissary of the Diocese, Bishop Geddes.\n\nMay I point out that the reasons that particularly appealed to the Department in coming to this decision\u2014that the students had been engaged and had actually commenced work in Yukon before the notice that the grant would not be allowed was received here\u2014apply equally to the case of Carmacks? I should be much obliged if you would kindly draw the attention of the Department to this fact.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nFinancial Secretary\nDawson,Y.T. September 2nd,1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated August 16th, file No 166-3-1, in reference to the continuance of the grant in the case of the seasonal Indian day schools at Champagne Landing and Teslin Lake,Y.T.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that upon the receipt of your letter notification of the Department's policy in regard to the two schools mentioned was sent to the Financial Secretary of the Diocese of Yukon. The enclosed letter was received from him today in which he calls attention to the case of Carmacks seasonal school.\n\nMr R.Ward,a student from the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver,B.C.is located at Carmacks for the summer,he has been conducting a day school for the native children. Like the two students at Champagne Landing and Teslin Lake,he had been engaged and had commenced work before the notice of the discontinuance of the grant had been received.\n\nIn view of the fact that the circumstances at Carmacks are similar to those at Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing it is hoped that the Department will give the case favorable consideration.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.Mackenzie.Esq.\nSecretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.Ont.\nOttawa, September 22, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the seasonal Indian day schools conducted in the Yukon.\n\nIt is noted that a seasonal school is being conducted at Carmacks (Little Salmon) and the Department will allow the usual grant towards the salary of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A. H. Sovereign, Bishop of Athabasca, was requested on September 7th to communicate with the Department early in the new year in order to ascertain if the schools are to be reopened next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nDiocese of Yukon, Canada\n\nFort Smith, N.W.T.,\nJanuary 23, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have before me your letter of Sept. 7th 1933, File No. 166-3-1, addressed to Right Rev. A.H. Sovereign, Bishop of Athabasca, with reference to grants allowed for Indian day schools in the Yukon. I have also before me a copy of Bishop Sovereign's letter to you of August 21st, 1933.\n\nI am writing to ask you to consider the possibility of continuing the grants to the Indian Day Schools at Carmacks, Champagne, and Teslin during the year 1934.\n\nFirst of all may I express my appreciation of your continuance of the grants to these schools for the year 1933.\n\nBishop Sovereign went into the matter so thoroughly in his letter that I feel sure nothing will be gained if I were to go over the same ground. From a knowledge gained in the past thirteen years from close and intimate contact with our Indian and Eskimo peoples of the North, I want to add my testimony to the value of the work that the Day schools are doing among our Native peoples. Work that I am convinced does not take second place even to the work that is being done in the Residential Schools. Some of the finest of our Indians in the North are those whose only education is what they were allowed to receive for a few short weeks in the summer of each year. Their education has not progressed so far as the graduates of the Residential Schools, yet they speak English, they can read and write, and in their standing in the Community, in their honesty and integrity, they are second to none.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt is not my intention or desire to belittle the work of our Indian Residential Schools. Nor do I wish to build up a case for our Day Schools by detracting in any way from the work being done in the Residential Schools. To my mind the two systems are complementary, for the Residential School makes possible the education of children who probably never come within a hundred miles or more of any of the Day Schools. At the same time I am convinced that where it is possible to operate a Day School it is by far the better way to educate the Indian Child. In a vast area, sparsely populated, such as the Yukon it is of course out of the question to give each child the opportunity of attending a Day School. But I think it would be most unwise to deprive the people of Teslin, for example, of the little opportunity we are giving them to become better citizens. As citizens of a Christian country we have a duty and a responsibility to the Native peoples of Canada, a responsibility that can, I am confident, be most efficiently discharged through the cooperation of the forces of Church and State.\n\nBefore I conclude, I should like to point out that during the Calendar year 1931, the Diocese of Yukon received from your Department, in the way of grants to Day Schools, St. Paul's Hostel, etc., the sum of $9116.99. In 1932 we received $7639.56. Up to the tenth of November 1933 we had received $3072.67. This latter sum of course will be increased by the payments for the December quarter and other adjustments, but I doubt very much that the total for 1933 will reach $6000.00. During this three year period the number of our workers has not decreased. We have effected some economies in the operation of St. Paul's Hostel due to a decrease in the number of children attending that Institution, but we have been hard pressed to maintain the work on our greatly reduced income.\n\nNo one sympathises with you more than I do, in your efforts to maintain, on a greatly reduced income, the vast amount of work that you are doing for the Indians of our great Dominion. At the same time I hope you will see the justice of my contention that in the past two years the Diocese of Yukon has borne at least its fair share of the economies effected; further that, if reductions are still necessary, they should be spread over the whole work and not confined to any one locality.\n\nI am planning to leave here for the Yukon about March 10th, travelling by way of Edmonton and Vancouver. I should like to hear from you prior to that date, if possible, as to whether we may expect any grants this year for the Day Schools at Carmacks, Champagne, and Teslin. I am hoping to make arrangements when I am in Vancouver, for the men to conduct the work at these three missions this year. But unless your Department can provide the usual grant for the Day Schools, I do not think it will be possible for us to open these schools this year.\nI sincerely hope that you may find it possible to continue the grants to the Day Schools at Carmacks, Champagne, and Teslin.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.A. Beddoe\nBishop of Yukon\nOttawa, February 8, 1934.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the grants that will be allowed for Indian day schools in the Yukon during the year 1934.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the matter of grants has received consideration, and the Department will allow a grant towards teacher's salary at each of the Carmacks, Champagne and Teslin Schools, at the rate of $3.00 per day, less 10%, for each day the schools are in operation. These grants will be paid upon receipt of returns, showing the attendance and the number of days each school was in operation.\n\nBesides the three above mentioned seasonal schools, the Department will continue payment of teacher's salary at the Moosehide and Selkirk Schools.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear, later, the names, qualifications, etc., of the men who will conduct the work at the three missions for which the per diem rate, as mentioned above, has been provided.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Geddes,\nBishop of Yukon\nJune 5, 1934.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nIn official letter dated June 5th, 1934, on File 166-12-1, the Department approved the appointment of L. G. Chappell, L. Th., to be in charge of the Champagne Landing Summer School for 1934 - salary to be allowed at the rate of $3.00 a teaching day.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\n6th February, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCANADA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have heard nothing from you regarding the grants for our school work in Yukon.\n\nI am assuming that the usual grants for Moosehide, Selkirk, Carmacks, Teslin and Champagne will be available this year. There is one other matter I would like to bring to your attention. For some years past the Indian children living at Whitehorse, Yukon, have been admitted to the school which is operated at Whitehorse by the Yukon Territorial Council. Shortly after the school term opened last September the Indian people were told that their children could no longer attend that school. There were 6 or 7 children affected in that way.\n\nAs our boarding school at Car Cross is already overcrowded it is practically impossible for the children at Whitehorse to be accommodated, and I am wondering if your department can help us in anyway to provide the means of education for these people at Whitehorse, and would you be willing to allow us similar grants to that for Selkirk and Moosehide on the same terms. If such a grant were available it would mean that we would place in charge of the school a fully qualified teacher who would devote his or her time to the work of the school since our Missionary at Whitehorse is much too busy to be able to do justice to a day school. Of course, I would not consider starting a school unless we had a sufficient number of children to justify engaging a teacher to give her whole time to that work, but I shall be glad if you can make it possible to allow us a grant, provided that a sufficient number of children can be found to take advantage of such a school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.A. Geddes\nBISHOP OF YUKON.\nOttawa, February 26, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that, for the summer of 1935, the Department will allow grant at the rate of $3 a teaching day towards the teacher's salary at Carmacks, Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing. Payment of the amount stated will be made on receipt of the usual returns showing the names of the children in attendance, days taught, etc.\n\nBesides the above mentioned seasonal schools, the Department will continue payment of the salary of the teacher at Moosehide and Selkirk. With reference to these two latter schools, I may say that the salary rate for each teacher is $1,100 a year. However, the Salary Deduction Act passed at the last session of Parliament provided that, when the total compensation paid a teacher was less than $1,000, there should be no deduction. If, however, the salary is over $1,000 but does not exceed $1,111, payment can be made at the rate of $1,000 a year only. Consequently, at the present time, each of these teachers is being paid $100 a teaching month.\n\nAs no provision has been made for the salary of a teacher at Whitehorse, the Department will be unable to provide the funds necessary to pay a teacher at the same rate as is allowed at Moosehide and Selkirk.\n\nPossibly the white school at Whitehorse would accept the six or seven children living in that vicinity if grant was allowed for them. In this connection, the Department would be prepared to allow a grant of $20 a year each, based on the average attendance. If you can make the necessary arrangements in this regard, you might advise me.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Binning\nA/Sup't.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1939.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nRe: Champagne Landing Seasonal School\n\nIn official letter of July 20, on file 166-12-1, the appointment of Mr. J. W. Ellis, as teacher of the above-mentioned school for the summer of 1939, is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from Dr. McGill's letter of November 21, 1942, addressed to Rt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, D.D., Bishop of Yukon, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI am disposed to think that some misunderstanding has arisen in respect to the operation of seasonal schools in the Yukon Territory. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the grants usually made to these schools have been withdrawn at any time. In the estimates of this year I note that provision has been made for the operation of the following schools: Champagne Landing, Old Crow Village, Rampart House, Teslin Lake and Whitehorse, in addition to the two more or less regular schools at Moosehide and Selkirk. The total amount set apart for the operation of these schools is $3,790.\n\nExtract from reply dated December 17, 1942, received from Bishop Geddes.\n\nI am a little concerned about the first paragraph in your letter regarding grants for the Seasonal Day Schools operated by our Church at Teslin, Champagne and Whitehorse. These three schools have been operated by our Church during the past three summers but we have been unable to receive the grants from your Department that formerly were paid. In fact in 1940 when the return for the Teslin Day School was forwarded to Ottawa it was returned with the notification that no grant would be paid. I gather from your letter that the funds for these schools are in the estimates that have been approved by Parliament and I shall be grateful if you can advise me as to how we can secure the grants for these schools that we have been operating.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo which refers to the Champagne Landing Seasonal School, the Department is prepared to allow the usual amount of $3.00 a day for each day the school was open from April 1, 1942. Before payment can be made it will be necessary for the teacher to forward returns giving the usual information. I enclose forms which the teacher should also complete and send to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W.A.

A communication has been received from Most Reverend I. O Stringer, D.D., Archbishop of Rupert's Land, stating that before notice was received that the grants would be discontinued, arrangements had been made to send in to Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing two students and that their expenses had already been paid. In view of this, it has been decided to continue the grant in the case of these two schools for the period they are open during the present summer months.\n\nI would request that you arrange with the teachers, after the closing of the schools for the summer period to prepare returns, showing attendance, days taught, etc., on the usual forms for that purpose and to forward them to the Department, through your office. A cheque in payment of the grant due for salaries will then be sent. His Grace is being informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

T.,\nAugust 29, 1934\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith the School Return submitted by the Rev. Mr. L. G. Chappell, covering his tuition in the Champagne and Kluksu districts over the period from May 18th to July 24th, 1934 after which date he was withdrawn from that district by Bishop Geddes, and transferred to Dawson to fill a vacancy occurring here.\n\nMr. Chappell informs me that he experienced much difficulty in maintaining regular attendances due to the parents moving from place to place in their efforts to obtain subsistence. He reports that he found the children very orderly and they were instructed in writing, spelling, elementary arithmetic, drawing and crayon work, with a little reading later on, and a series of games and physical exercises were given during recess periods.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T.

For this reason they deem a Residential School better suited than a summer day school.\n\nCopied:\nCS\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 925-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6477)\n\nFile 919-10, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Aklavik Church of England Residential School - Admissions & Discharges. 1936 - 1946\n\nFile 925-1, part 1\nYukon Agency - Champagne Landing Day School - General Administration. 1911 - 1943\n\nFile 925-2, part 1\nYukon Agency - Champagne Landing Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1937 - 1939\n\nFile 925-3, part 1\nYukon Agency - Champagne Landing Day School - Teachers' Salaries. 1911 - 1939\n\nFile 925-4, part 1\nYukon Agency - Champagne Landing Day School - Supplies 1926 - 1927\n\nFile 925-5, part 1\nYukon Agency - Champagne Landing Day School - Building Maintenance - Supplies-Accounts. 1914 - 1947\n\nFile 926-1, part 1\nYukon Agency - Little Salmon Day School - (Carmachs) - General Administration. 1908 - 1950\n\nFile 926-3, part 1\nYukon Agency - Little Salmon Day School - (Carmachs) - Teachers' Salaries. 1914 - 1946\n\nFile 926-5, part 1\nYukon Agency - Little Salmon Day School - (Carmachs) - Supplies-Accounts. 1947 - 1950\n\nFile 927-1, part 1\nYukon Agency - Moosehide Day School - General Administration. 1908 - 1949\n\nFile 927-3, part 1\nYukon Agency - Moosehide Day School - Teachers' Salaries. 1902 - 1947\n\nFile 927-5, part 1\nYukon Agency - Moosehide Day School - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts. 1946 - 1950\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 926 - 1 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT GENERAL\n\nLITTLE SALMON DAY SCHOOL\nAT CARMACKS Y.T.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM AUG 1908\nTO JUNE 1950\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\n\nFILE ........................................

No appropriation for the salary of a teacher has been made and before the Department can pay a grant for it you will be good enough to forward a full report on this school stating the number of Indian children and whether the Indians reside permanently there, or the period of the year during which they live at this point. You will also be good enough to inform the Department as to the building in which the school is conducted and the accommodation provided for teaching the children. Upon receipt of full information from you the Department will take into consideration the paying of a salary the same as is provided for the teachers of the other day schools in the Yukon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Oct 7th, 1914.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Sep't 18th, file # 468106/2 in reference to the school at Little Salmon.\n\nIn my report of Aug 8th on the Little Salmon band of Indians I mentioned that a day school had been opened and that the schoolroom, at the time of my visit, had not been properly fitted up as they were waiting the arrival of lumber to construct desks and seats.\n\nSince my visit it has been reported by the Bishop of the Yukon, who was recently at Little Salmon, that desks and seats sufficient to accommodate the pupils have been put into the school.\n\nThe schoolroom is a well built log building with good shingle roof and the ground fenced in by wire fencing, it is warm, well ventilated, and lighted by two good windows on each side of the building. Enclosed herewith is a photo, the first building is the residence of the teacher, the second at the right of the picture with ladder on the roof is the school. Being a new building it is in excellent repair.\n\nThere are 30 pupils on the roll, 21 boys and 9 girls, the attendance is rather irregular on the part of some of the pupils by reason of the necessity of going away to hunt. While at the settlement the pupils attend fairly regularly.\n\nThe school is open for at least six months of the year that is from April 1st to Sep't 30th the teacher is in residence during that period. The Indians do not stay around the settlement much during the winter months consequently the teacher goes to Carmacks from Oct to March and from there visits Little Salmon when the Indians are in. During these visits he\nJ.D.M.\n\nconducts the day school.\n\nLittle Salmon is a permanent settlement of Indians; they spend most of the winter hunting and trapping in the surrounding district bringing in the results of their hunt occasionally during this period and exchanging them for necessary supplies.\n\nI had an opportunity of seeing the progress some of the pupils had made, several write fairly well and read words or three letters correctly. Considering the short time the school has been opened the teacher has done very well with the material he has to work upon.\n\nThe Department has already sent a supply of school material so that now the school is well equipped for work.\n\nThe Rev C. Swanson, B.A. is in charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSup't of Indians.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the letter hereunder from Mr. Hawksley, Superintendent of Indians for the Yukon, reporting on the day school which has been opened at Little Salmon in that territory in charge of Rev. Cecil Swanson, B.A. of Toronto University. They wish to have this school recognized by the Department and provision made for a salary for the teacher.\n\nThe grant allowed for day schools in the Yukon is at the rate of $720.00 per annum. None of these schools are open the whole of the year and Mr. Hawksley says that the Little Salmon School would only be open about six months in the year. There are thirty pupils on the roll, which is a higher enrolment than at any of the other day schools in the territory. You will see from the accompanying snapshot that they have a school building and teacher's residence already and the school has had seats and desks provided. I think the Department would be quite justified in recognizing this school and making the usual grant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 926-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 7, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo reporting on the Day School which has been opened at Little Salmon by the Rev.

A. Geddes, Bishop of Yukon, has nominated Mrs. Heron as teacher of the Cormacks seasonal school this year.\n\nHer appointment was approved by official letter of June 10th, on File 166-3-1.\n\nSalary will be allowed her at the rate of $3 a teaching day.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 926-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nJanuary 23, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a return signed by Rev. R.C.W. Ward showing that he operated the Carmacks Seasonal School for a period of 35 days between October 30 and December 22, 1939.\n\nThis is the first intimation that the Department has received that this school would be in operation during the calendar year 1939. As a matter of fact our records show that Rev. Mr. Ward is the teacher of the Selkirk Indian Day School and he has been paid salary at that school for the months of October, November and December, 1939. Under these circumstances it is difficult to understand how he also taught at the Carmacks School. In view of the fact that he has already been paid for the period October 1 to December 31 as teacher of the Selkirk School it is not possible to consider any payment for his services at the Carmacks School for the period during which he states he had the school in operation. Incidentally I may say that due to the economic conditions now confronting us it will not be possible for the Department to make any allowance for seasonal schools until such time as you are further advised. We will, however, continue to pay the regular salary to the teachers at the Moosehide, Old Crow Village and Selkirk schools as we understand that these schools are operated for 10 months in each academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

Sir:\n\nThe Department received a day school return from the Little Salmon (Carmacks) School for the quarter ended December 31st and we allowed $3 a day for a period of 59 days.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a return for the quarter ended March 31st in which the teacher states that the school was in operation for 52 days. In reviewing this return it is noted that although 15 pupils were registered only 3 attended for a period of more than 20 days. Many of the others attended for only 2 or 3 days. Under the circumstances, we feel that a fair amount to allow would be $3 per day for 40 days, and a cheque for this amount is being forwarded to your Financial Secretary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

As you are probably aware, an amendment was made this year to the Civil Service Superannuation Act which makes it increasingly difficult to employ civil servants, temporary or otherwise, past the age of 65.

His views indicate that Mr. Bridge has other interests than those of the school and that therefore he is not conducting it probably in accordance with the regulations laid down in the School Register.\n\nWe doubt also whether the Department is receiving full value for its salary outlay, particularly when we compare this school with the one at Mayo.\n\nWe have two alternatives that are obvious at the present time:\n\n(1) to write to the Bishop concerning Mr. Bridge,\n\n(2) to suggest to the Bishop a transfer or exchange between Mr. Bridge and Mr. Brownlee at Carmacks.\n\nI would be quite prepared, in an official letter to Mr. Bridge, if this transfer is approved, to advise him that departmental regulations must be strictly observed in operating our day schools, particularly insofar as opening and closing\nhours are concerned. It seems evident that Mr. Bridge is sincere enough in his efforts but that he takes every opportunity to give visits to Dawson City, etc., a priority over his teaching duties.

In reviewing this return it is noted that although 15 pupils were registered only 3 attended for a period of more than 20 days. Many of the others attended for only 2 or 3 days. Under the circumstances, we feel that a fair amount to allow would be $3 per day for 40 days, and a cheque for this amount is being forwarded to your Financial Secretary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

There is a Day School at this camp carried on by the Rev. R. Totty, with eighteen enrolled and an average attendance of seven. The children we found fairly bright and were informed that they are improving. These Indians spend about four months of the year away from home, fishing and hunting. They have fourteen log houses fairly furnished.\n\nWe have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servants\n\nA.W.Vowell\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nA.F.Green\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\nEXTRACT FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF REV. JOHN HAWKESLEY, SUPERINTENDENT OF INDIANS ON THE SCHOOLS IN THE YUKON.\n\nMOOSEHIDE DAY SCHOOL,\u2014\n\nThe progress made by the pupils is not what it should be. I am inclined to think that the deafness of the teacher is a serious drawback.\n\nTeacher\u2014Rev. B. Totty\nOttawa, March 18, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your annual report in which you state that the progress of the pupils of the Moosehide Day School is not what it should be owing to the deafness of the teacher I beg to say that the Department would like you to bring this matter to the attention of the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. John Hawksley,\nSuperintendent of Indians,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDawson, T.T., April 27th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to yours of April 10th in which you state that slow progress has apparently been made by the pupils of the Moosehide Day School, I wish to say that I have visited the school several times, and have considered the question very carefully.\n\nIn the first place, the apparent progress in all the Indian day schools is very slow, and is due to some extent to the fact that the children do not attend the school regularly, as they accompany their parents on expeditions away from the school. I have endeavoured to point out to the teacher at Moosehide certain possible improvements, and I trust good progress may be made. I shall be glad to hear from you again after your next visit to the school, and I shall do my best to co-operate in every possible way with a view to making these and the other day schools as efficient as possible.\n\n(Signed)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Yukon.\nDawson, Y.T. May 3rd, 1915.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of March 18th, 1915, file #181107/1 regarding the slow progress made by the pupils of the Moosehide Indian Day School, I beg to state that I have called the attention of the Bishop of Yukon to the condition of affairs at Moosehide. I have the honor to enclose here-with a copy of his lordships reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nREPORT ON THE WORK OF THE PUPILS OF MOOSEHIDE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nREADING:- Seven of the pupils were using the reading cards supplied by the Department, they repeated the words in a parrot like manner indicating that it was memory rather than sight reading, some of them were rather puzzled when unexpectedly taken back a few lines and asked to read over that particular line. The teacher's attention was called to this fault which is, I think, the result of the teacher repeating the words along with his pupils.\n\nThree pupils were using primer pt 1, their work may be classed as very fair, they are rather slow in picking up the meanings of the English words.\n\nSPELLING:- The work was only fair in this subject, lack of application on the part of the pupils is the reason that may be assigned as the cause.\n\nWRITING:- Always a favorite study of the Indians was on the whole good, there is more progress in this subject than in any other dealt with in the school.\n\nARITHMETIC:- Simple addition was as far as any of the pupils had gone with the exception of one who had been for a time at the Carcross School, he was doing multiplication, the work of all the pupils was good and accurate, the figures were poorly formed however all the pupils passed the tests given.\n\nDICTION:- Four pupils sat for this test and passed it creditably, words of four letters was the limit given.\n\nSinging :- Very poor, the teacher is not at all musical and not well able to lead in this.\n\nCALISTHENICS:- All drills taken from the Manual were very well done the pupils are apparently interested in this subject.\n\nDiscipline and Conduct:- Very Good on the part of all.\n\nMarch 25th, 1918.\n\nDawson.

Williams, Financial Secretary of the Diocese of Yukon, has notified me that Mr John Lawrence has resigned his position of Indian Day School teacher at the Moosehide Indian school and that Jimmy Wood, ex-pupil of the Carcross school has been appointed to fill the position temporarily until the return of the Rev R. Totty next summer. He commenced his duties on Oct 25th and carried on the school for two weeks when owing to unforeseen circumstances the school was closed until Nov 17th, when it was re-opened and is now running smoothly.\n\nHoping this temporary appointment will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, December 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant informing the Department that you have been notified that Mr. Lawrence resigned his position as teacher of the Moosehide Indian Day School and that he has been succeeded by Jimmy Wood, an ex-pupil of the Carcross Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this change of teachers is noted and the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Jimmy Wood until such time as a qualified teacher can be obtained. While approving of his temporary appointment, it is doubtful whether he will meet with much success, as he has no professional qualifications and no knowledge of teaching. It is noted that he commenced duties on October 25th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst.

The Rev B. Totty will return to Mooseneide next July and will then resume his duties as teacher.\n\nMay I say that I am in close touch with this school and that so far Jimmy Wood has done pretty well considering that he has no professional qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCHRISTIE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.\n\nAt the time of my visit to Christie this summer, I found Father Calmus, the principal, doing splendid work. He is busy from morning until night\u2014administrating, teaching and supervising the boys' activities, even in the barns. Sister Caroline, the Superior, is a splendid type. She says Father Calmus is doing better than any of the late Principals.\n\nThe boys are not worked half enough, and the Principal is erecting a gymnasium to work off their surplus energy.\n\nI advised the re-shingling of the roof and promised two sewing machines. We should pay part of the account for shingling.\n\nThe girls' dormitory was especially fine. There is a chair beside each bed\u2014a splendid arrangement.\n\nThe water supply is adequate.\n\nThe property belongs to the O.S.B. Order, but if they withdrew it would revert to the Diocese. The land is all stumps and rocks, and there is no possible chance to farm, or to have a good garden. The Department should go slow taking over this property, as the land is so bad.\n\nThere is a very bright boy at this school by the name of Moses Smith, and the Department might do well to offer him tuition in a few years, upon graduation.\n\nMr. Agent Cox has not been at Christie for two years, and the Principal claims that Constable Bartlett has not been any help to them of late.\n\nI understand Father Moser is going back to this vicinity as missionary.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nLawson, Yukon, Canada,\nMarch 26, 1924.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been looking over the list of the grants made by your Department to the Indian Day Schools in Yukon, and I wish to ask about the grant given towards Moosehide Day School for the quarter ending September 1923. The number of days in the quarter in which school was open was 52 and the average attendance 6.2. The grant for the quarter was $92.00. The grant for the quarter ending December 1923 for Moosehide Day School is $276.00 and the school was open 63 days with an average attendance of 6.8. The difference in the amount is much greater than the difference in the teaching days would indicate, and I think some mistake may have been made. There may however be some explanation that does not occur to me, but I shall be glad of a line from you on this matter.\n\nI wish to thank you for your continued interest in and support of the Indian Day Schools. In the case of some of the Indian Schools we are able to have regular school the year round. In other places the Indians travel around a great deal and it seems impossible to hold school except at certain seasons of the year when the Indians assemble in one place. However, we are doing what we can to hold Day Schools wherever possible and we are greatly encouraged by your grants given towards the upkeep of the school.\nIn visiting the different centres where Lay Schools have been held, I always feel considerably encouraged. The Indian children in some cases may appear to be making slow progress but it is the only opportunity they have to get any advancement in school subjects. The teachers take advantage of the opportunity to give the children instruction in deportment and knowledge of things generally, and I feel the energy put forth is well worth while.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 22, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that previous to September 1st last, the Department paid the salary and rent at the Moosehide Indian Day School on a quarterly basis, but beginning on the date mentioned it was decided to pay salary, etc., of all Indian day schools on a basis of ten teaching months in the academic year.\n\nThe amount allowed at Moosehide is $720.00 a year and, in addition, an allowance of $200.00 a year is made for the rent of the building. This makes a total amount for the academic year of $920.00 and payment of this is made as follows:\n\n| Month     | Salary          | Rent   |\n|-----------|-----------------|--------|\n| September | $72.00          | $20.00 |\n| December  | $216.00         | $60.00 |\n| March     | $216.00         | $60.00 |\n| June      | $216.00         | $60.00 |\n\nTotal salary and rent ........................................ $920.00\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nRight Rev.

Credit is due the teacher for her good work.\n\nThe school was visited by the Gold Commissioner and Mrs McLean accompanied by 14 other friends to witness the closing exercises of the pupils prior to the Christmas holidays.

The enrolment at Moosehide was 5, with an average attendance of 6, while the enrolment at Selkirk was 9, with an average attendance of 8. As you are aware, the Department has been allowing salary at the rate of $110 per teaching month, less 10%, for the teacher at each of these schools. In view of the attendance, however, it is felt that this salary is rather high.\n\nI would appreciate receiving a full report regarding the attendance both at Moosehide and Selkirk. You should state if all the Indian children living at these points are enrolled at the day schools and what steps, if any, could be taken to increase the attendance.\n\nIf the attendance cannot be increased, the Department would appreciate an expression of your views regarding a reduction in the salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In the case of the Moosehide School, it has been open for the months of April, May and June. Consequently, between September 1, 1940, and March 31, 1941, salary is only available for six months.\n\nIn view of the request of the teacher, the Department has no objection to the Moosehide school remaining open for September, but it should be closed for the month of January. Salary will not be paid the teacher for the latter month.\n\nOf course, if the teacher wishes to keep the school in operation during January without receiving salary for that month, the Department has no objection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor T.

A cheque refunding the amount contributed by the teacher of an Indian day school to the retirement fund is usually issued about a month or six weeks after the teacher completes services in our school.

B. O. G. Dixon, who has been teaching at the above day school for approximately three years, is leaving the Territory at the end of June.\n\nSome days ago he intimated to me that Bishop W. W. A. Geddes had requisitioned his services for the last three weeks of June at St. Paul's Anglican Hostel for half-breed children, and had suggested to him that the Indian Jimmy Woods (Acting Chief) could substitute for him at the day school during this short period. Jimmy woods received his educational training at the Carcross Residential School, and apparently is qualified to superintend such schooling as the Moosehide Indian children receive, for the short period remaining before the end of the school term.\n\nI intimated that I would place the matter before you with my recommendation.

Dixon in early June, there has been no missionary at Moosehide Indian village. Jimmy Woods, the present elected chief, or chairman of the council, taught in the Day School for the three remaining weeks of Mr. Dixon's term. His qualifications were indicated to the Department at the time authorization for this was obtained.\n\nBishop W. A. Geddes has approached the writer with the suggestion that the Department might consider allowing Jimmy Woods to teach the Moosehide Indian Day School during the coming half term. He suggested that a salary of $75.00, rather than $100.00 monthly would be appropriate. It seems to me that the idea has some merit, and I therefore recommend it. As the time between now and the New Year is short, perhaps you might send authorization by wire if the Bishop's suggestion is approved.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 3, 1945.\n\nMr. J. E.

Approve temporary appointment Jimmy Woods, Moosehide Indian School, at salary seventy-five a month.\"\n\nIt should be understood that the appointment of Jimmy Woods is temporary and in any case should not continue after the end of June, 1945. It is hoped that Bishop Geddes will be able to secure a qualified teacher for this school for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nAs Woods is an Indian, employed on a reserve, he is not subject to income tax. However, it will be necessary for him to complete the Cost-of-Living Bonus form and the staff questionnaire form. I enclose these and you should have them properly completed and returned to this office at the earliest possible date. Payment of his salary cannot be made until these forms are received.

Meek)\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\nOn September 17th I flew to Dawson. The first problem was to discreetly persuade the Indians living in very bad houses in Dawson, to move downstream three miles to their traditional village of Moosehide, where a day school was being organized. Most of my time at Dawson was spent in reviewing correspondence, studying circulars, etc. A very large amount of mail had been held pending my arrival at Dawson, which was cleared up before leaving. Upon my departure all Indian families but one had moved to Moosehide, the day school had commenced, the dilapidated community Hall patched up, and community life - dormant for a number of years - again assumed the Indian pattern.\n\nR.J. MEKK\nIndian Agent\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, April 12, 1947.\n\nR. J. Meek, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nFurther to your letter of March 26, re the preparation of Annual Estimates, and our reply of March 25, please be advised that many of the sheets included in a complete set of Welfare Estimates do not refer to your agency. The Indians of Canada are divided into two classes: Treaty Indians and non-Treaty Indians. Your Indians belong to the latter class and are not entitled by treaty terms to issues of Ammunition, Nets, Snare-wire, Triennial Clothing, etc.\n\nIn the three Prairie Provinces, the Northwest Territories and remote areas where Indians are located long distances from source of supplies, Agents estimate their relief requirements - food, soap, etc., a year in advance. These supplies are purchased on contract from wholesalers and shipped in to departmental warehouses, from which they are distributed weekly, or monthly, to aged and indigent Indians who have no other source of maintenance.\n\nIn the other parts of the Dominion and your agency, assistance is supplied by direct purchase from the merchant. However, if your Indians can be taken off direct relief by the issue of nets, ammunition, snare-wire or seeds, the branch is prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any representations you may care to make. In fact, it will be in order to include items in your 1947-48 Estimates covering requirements in tent duck (Allotment 12-421) canoe canvas (09-632) ammunition, twine for nets and snare-wire (02-229).\n\nInsofar as Indian Education is concerned, it is not necessary to estimate for desks, supplies, rents and teachers' salaries.\nsalaries. These are all included by the Branch in a bulk amount, based on part year's requirements and new commitments.\n\nHowever, it will be necessary to include estimates for:\n\n(1) Repairs required to government-owned buildings; and\n\n(2) New buildings required.\n\nIf you will please let us know your requirements for biscuits, we will put these amounts in our order which goes to the manufacturers on May 15. To assist you in estimating requirements, it is suggested that you allow for 6 lbs. per student in average attendance, e.g., if average attendance is 20 - then ask for 120 lbs. of biscuits for that particular school.\n\nBernard F.

This would insure the building being adequately warmed for the children at considerable saving of cost. It seems useless waste to have to keep the school house warm all night without an occupant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMrs. Taylor,\n\nyour children are entitled to all the privileges of the scouts except that until they have passed head examination I cannot admit them to any house parties.

Bridge\nTeacher in charge\n\nThat won't break their hearts.\nThe Rectory,\nMoose Hide, Y.T.\n13th October, 1946.\n\nMrs. David Taylor.,\nMoose Hide, Y.T.\n\nDear Madam.,\n\nUntil such time as you move into Moose Hide, taking up permanent residence there, I must refuse admission of your children to the Day School at Moose Hide.\n\nIt is considered necessary that steps be immediately taken to ensure proper care of those children attending school, this is not being done, the responsibility resting entirely with the mother of these children.\n\nResponsibility cannot be shifted to other children who are at present minors. Further refusal on the part of any children to do work assigned by the teacher in charge renders such children liable to suspension until such children see fit to do work assigned. The only exemption from such duties must be accompanied by a Doctor's certificate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMoosehide School:\n\nThe Archbishop is perhaps not aware that the school is not operated during the summer months (July and August). In some years June might be a \"summer\" month.\n\nPlease note the three missives underleaf.\n\nA great deal of friction has been caused by conducting school in the house. Mr. Bridge has required the children to do certain chores which are more associated with the home than the school. This activity is resented by certain parents.\n\nThe space in the house available for school automatically operates to reduce the attendance. The attached photo shows the woefully inadequate blackboard available in the room used. And further, since no storage space for surplus books, etc., is available, the resulting clutter has to be seen to be believed!\n\nThe vacant school was rented to Indians as a house. The outcome was a row of the first magnitude. When the school becomes vacant again, it will set up a chain reaction which will be heard as far at least as Whitehorse.\n\nFinally, I had to remonstrate with one Indian woman who added up the factors of single man, house and Indian girls to trump up the old, old story.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\nOttawa, July 14, 1947.\n\nDear Archbishop Adams:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 25 with regard to our Indian School at Moosehide, Y.T.\n\nWe have recently had our Educational Survey Officer, Major C.A. Clark, visit this school. He has been consulted concerning Captain Bridge's request. Major Clark informs us that a great deal of friction has already been caused by conducting school in the teacher's residence. Some of the Indians complained to Major Clark that Captain Bridge had required the children to do certain chores which were more associated with the home than with the school. Such activities were resented by some of the parents.\n\nThe space in the teacher's residence available for school automatically operates to reduce the attendance. Photographs in our possession show the woefully inadequate blackboard space available in the room now being used and also the poor lighting. Furthermore, since no storage space for surplus books was available, the room presented an untidy appearance.\n\nDuring a certain period, the vacant school was rented to Indians as a house. Apparently this also caused a great deal of resentment on the part of the Indians.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Reverend Walter R.

Requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., should be the subject of separate communications.\n\nUnfortunately influenza was in the village and a number of children were absent. Mr. Bridge is doing very good work in connection with gardens including quite a large plot worked by the children as a school project. Progress appears to be normal. Mr. Bridge's chief concern seems to be the tendency for families to move away from Moosehide Village to Dawson city, three or four miles away. There are several reasons for this exodus, not the least of which, unfortunately, can be attributed to Mr. Bridge himself.\n\nAgency Yukon\nIndian Agent\n\nI.A. 407\nR. 3043\nFile Clerk, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nOn April 25th, 1949, I wrote a letter concerning the Moosehide Indian Day School, which is now filed under 927-1 (E) at Ottawa.

At any rate, can you let me have a copy of my letter of April 25 please.\n\nR.J.

I did not receive the carbon copy but am pleased to provide you with another copy.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nMoosehide Day School\n\nReference your letter of 6th ultimo, file 927-1 (E), concerning Mr. H.E. Bridge, teacher at Moosehide Indian Day School.\n\nI suggest that your first alternative, i.e., that the Department write to Archbishop W.R. Adams re Mr. Bridge, is the better one. His Grace is not unaware of the difficulty of co-operating with Mr. Bridge.\n\nI do not think a transfer between Mr. Bridge at Moosehide and Mr. W.J. Brownlee at Carmacks would be an advantage. Mr. Brownlee is doing a very fine job at Carmacks; he is an honourable bumbling type, painfully punctilious, but lacking the imagination and leadership necessary for the Moosehide School. Mr. Brownlee's personality is consistent with the Indians of Carmacks and I would recommend he remain at that school.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nMoosehide Indian Day School\n\nI am very sorry to bother you about a mistake made at this office. Your letter of June 30th, 1949, your file 927-1 (E) attached copy of letter from this office dated April 25th. Unfortunately this was not the letter referred to.\n\nThe letter which has gone missing is my letter dated April 25th and to which you replied on May 6th, 1949, under your file 927-1 (E). My letter concerned a complaint of Chief James Wood against H.E. Bridge, teacher at Moosehide Indian Day School. Copy of my letter is requested please.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nE. This last letter seems to have been copied by the Indian writer.\n\nAs I stated previously (May 4), \"Chief Jimmy Wood has little else to do except to badger Bridge, who is not difficult to irritate.\"\n\nIt's a difficult place to visit without heralding one's approach; or, alternatively, staying several days so as to cut out any stage-setting. Mr. Hubbard in Dawson City might be able to make unannounced visits, but I feel that if several fancy forms were designed for practical return to this office, Mr. Bridge would not put his signature to anything that is not so.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting MOOSEHIDE Indian Day School\nfor the month October, 1949.\n\nName of Teacher Mr. H.E.

Quarter 1917 for Middle River School. I deposited the cheque in the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Dawson, thinking it was a grant for one of our schools, and that perhaps a mistake had been made in the name Middle River. On looking it up more carefully there does not seem to be any school in Yukon to which this would correspond, and I write you now asking if the Department has not made a mistake. If you advise me to that effect, I shall return the amount to your Department.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 927-3, part 1)\nOttawa, April 4, 1918.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's letter of the 4th ultimo, I beg to inform you that cheque No. 2206, for $105.80 was the grant due September quarter last, for the Moosehide Day School.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRight Rev. Isaac O. Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson,\nYukon.\nDiocese of Yukon,\nCanada.\n\nDawson, June 29, 1918.\n\nSecretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of April 4th in which you state that the cheque of $105.80 was intended for the Moosehide Day School for the quarter ending September 1917.\n\nI had received nothing from your Department for that particular quarter, but there still seems to be some mistake with reference to the amount. During the September quarter of 1917, school was held for forty-two days, as you will see by referring to the report. In previous quarters you allowed a per diem of $4.60, which would make the September quarter 1917 grant $193.20.\n\nThe cheque in question which you state was intended for Moosehide Day School September quarter 1917 amounted to $105.80. This would indicate that there still would be some mistake. I write you in case you may be able to clear the matter up.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. O.

The number of days in the quarter in which school was open was 52 and the average attendance 6.2. The grant for the quarter was $92.00. The grant for the quarter ending December, 1923, for Moosehide day school is $276.00 and the school was open 63 days with an average attendance of 6.8. The difference in the amount is much greater than the difference in the teaching days would indicate and I think some mistake may have been made. There may, however, be some explanation that does not occur to me but I shall be glad of a line from you on this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIsaac O. Yukon.\nOttawa, April 22, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that previous to September 1st last, the Department paid the salary and rent at the Moosehide Indian Day School on a quarterly basis, but beginning on the date mentioned it was decided to pay salary, etc., at all Indian day schools on a basis of ten teaching months in the academic year.\n\nThe amount allowed at Moosehide is $720.00 a year and, in addition, an allowance of $200.00 a year is made for the rent of the building. This makes a total amount for the academic year of $920.00 and payment of this is made as follows:\n\n| Month       | Salary          | Rent   |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------|\n| September qr. (1 month) | $72.00         | $20.00 |\n| December \" (3 \" ) | $216.00        | $60.00 |\n| March \" (3 \" ) | $216.00        | $60.00 |\n| June \" (3 \" ) | $216.00        | $60.00 |\n\nTotal salary and rent ...........................................$920.00\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nRight Rev.

L. G. Chappel had replaced Rev. Alex Anderson on September 1, 1938.\n\nAs you are aware the cheques in payment of salaries of teachers of Indian schools are issued monthly and they are mailed from here in time to reach the school before the last day of the month. Previous to your visit the salary cheque for the month of September, amounting to $110.00, was mailed to Rev. Alex Anderson, Dawson, Y.T. Immediately on receipt of your information that Rev. Mr. Anderson had been succeeded by Rev. L. G. Chappel the former was written and requested to return the September salary cheque No. 95591 for $110.00. As yet this cheque has not been returned. Present regulations do not permit our issuing a cheque to Mr. Chappel until Rev. Mr. Anderson returns the cheque sent to him. I should appreciate it if you would get in touch with Rev. Mr. Anderson and arrange to have him send back the cheque that was forwarded to him. As soon as this is received the salary due Rev. L. G. Chappel will be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. W.A.

Bridge, in charge of the Church of England day school at Moosehide Indian Village, near Dawson, Y.T., is proceeding to that point in a few days. He is interested in introducing physical training and sports to the pupils of his school and requests that a football be forwarded to him. It is also thought that the Indians would take quickly to their traditional game of lacrosse. My own experience with Indians of the Stikine Agency shows that they were enthusiastic when I brought in a dozen lacrosse sticks in 1936. I would suggest that if it is in order two dozen lacrosse sticks and three lacrosse balls be sent to Capt. Bridge for use at the Moosehide Indian school.\n\nThe school has not been in operation for two years owing to shortage of personnel. Not much school equipment is left, and when Capt. Bridge has been there for a week or so he intends to send me a list of school requirements. In the meantime could the following necessities be forwarded to Capt. Bridge, at Dawson:\n\n- 5 doz rough scribblers, unlined\n- 5 doz drawing books\n- 1 box white chalk\n- 2 doz boxes crayons\n- 5 doz ruled exercise books\n- \u00bd gross pencils\n- 1 box colored chalk\n- 1 box erasers\n\nR.J.

H.B. Bridge, in charge of the Indian Day School at Moosehide, near Dawson. He states in part:\n\n\"I have purchased a second hand phonograph from A. Barnes for $13.00 for the school. I am borrowing a number of records of good music, vocal, instrumental and orchestral for purposes of musical appreciation. Do you think the Department would pay for this, no obligation of course but my income is very small and expense just the opposite, there might also be some records supplied by the Indian Department of an educational value.\"\n\nI do not know the policy of the Department with regard to musical appreciation in day schools. Capt. Bridge has taken a great deal of interest in the cultural side of the children's education. I understand he trained a choir of Indian youngsters who sang at Dawson for the Christmas festivities. Capt. Bridge himself was formerly a professional singer in the U.S.A.\n\nHe further informs me he put on a special treat for the children at Christmas, with presents for each child. The presents came from Los Angeles by a generous donor.\n\nCapt. Bridge's great interest in the cultural life of the children would appear to be deserving of some encouragement.

As authorized from this office to Mr. H.E. Bridge, teacher in charge at Moosehide. | 16.60  |\n\nI hereby Certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada. This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 194\n\nDate: April 17th, 1948\nWhile accompanying T-B clinic to Moosehide Indian Reserve, Dawson, Y.T., on June 17th, Mr. H.E. Bridge, teacher at the Indian Day School, Moosehide, informed me that he had obtained enough new spruce logs to build a proper school adjoining and abutting the present Church of England mission.\n\nIn company with Archbishop W.R. Adams, Bishop of the Yukon, we were shown that the present school building is in an extremely dilapidated condition, and would be torn down shortly. Mr. Bridge had been forced to conduct the school in the large living room of the Mission, but it had not proved satisfactory. The idea was to make a large opening in the south wall of the living room, opening to the newly proposed classroom, measuring approximately 20' x 30'.\n\nApparently Mr. Bridge had succeeded in interesting some benefactors in the Indians of Moosehide who were prepared to contribute several hundred dollars to a new school. His Grace proposed to contribute $300.00 of church funds, and has requested $300.00 towards the schoolroom from Indian Affairs Branch. Could the $200.00 contained in the 1948-49 Estimates for repairs to Moosehide School be granted to this enterprise. The sum of $100.00 asked for to repair school at Fort Selkirk will not be used, as the school has now been closed at the request of the Department, though Archbishop Adams continues the salary of the former teacher Mrs. Cowaret who conducts the school for the benefit of some half dozen Indian children.\n\nThe $300.00 requested for school building will be for labor in erecting same, and materials for roofing, etc. Logs have already been taken to site. A new schoolroom will certainly be a great improvement on the present mission house-schoolroom setup. If funds are available I would recommend authorization be given as soon as possible.\n\n(R.J.

It will reopen on October 1st.\n\nDuring August and continuing to the present, a new schoolroom has been built - a very good one I am informed.

Several hundred dollars were subscribed by the business men of Dawson, the balance being paid by the Diocese of the Yukon.\n\nArchbishop W.R. Adams has now requested the sum of $200.00 for installing an electrical unit. This generator (2400 KW) was given to the school by the Yukon Territorial Government. It is a heavy engine requiring a cement foundation. The electric plant will be used for lighting the school and for a moving picture projection machine.\n\nMay I pleased be advised if $200.00 can be allocated for electric installation.\n\n(R.J.

Bridge, teacher, that cocoa, sugar and milk is not supplied to the children of his school for noon-day lunches.\n\nA supply of vitaminized biscuits was sent to Mr. Bridge this Fall. To supplement these Dr. Procter suggested, and I would recommend, that consideration be given for a small monthly grant for milk, cocoa and sugar. I would suggest that supplies to the value of $10.00 per month be granted for the winter months - November to April, inclusive.\n\n(P.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\n2nd April, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 21st ultimo, the Department approves a\nmonthly expenditure of $10.00 towards the\npurchase of a quantity of milk, cocoa and sugar\nin order to serve a hot drink to the children\nof the Moosehide School.\n\nThe expenditure mentioned may be incurred\nfor the month of April, 1949, and may also be incurred\nfor the period 1st November, 1949, to 30th April,\n1950. When forwarding the accounts covering the\ncost of the milk, cocoa and sugar, you should give\nthe date and file number of this letter.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nReference your letter of 1st ultimo, file 927-5 (E.I.), and my voucher No. 38 covering Accountable Advance of $300.00 for Moosehide Indian Lay School. Your penultimate paragraph concerning an allowance of $50.00 to Mission Fund by Dawson Hardware Co. and the Northern Commercial Co. Ltd., means that these two firms have donated $50.00 each, as noted on face of their accounts.\n\nJ.C.B. Williamson, the Treasurer of the Diocese states as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the account for the Dawson Hardware of $23.37, the purchase slips are attached covering all items with the exception of the first two of which particulars are on the account. With reference to the Dawson Hardware account of $96.46, purchase slips amounting to $92.45 are attached. With regard to the $4.01 I regret neither Bridge nor the Dawson Hardware or myself have these slips totalling the amount, but these accounts totalling $96.46 were definitely paid from this accountable advance of $300.00. With regard to the account for labor of $100.50, attached thereto are four cancelled cheques for $100.50 to Indians covering this amount of labor. I trust this is satisfactory, and have to advise that it is the best that can be done in the matter.\"\n\nMy original voucher No. 38, together with all necessary receipts is attached hereto.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nMoosehide Indian Day School\n\nWith further reference to my letter of December 9th, 1948, and your reply of December 16th, file 927-5 (E.), concerning radio sets for the above school,\n\nI have interviewed Mr. Chapman, a member of the radio committee at Dawson who informed me that the Dawson radio transmitter CFYT, has recently been broadcasting educational programmes through the Department of Education for B.C., in co-operation with the C.B.C. The subjects included musical appreciation, historical and geographical subjects, etc. These recordings were released twice a week.\n\nMr. R. Huland, Superintendent of Schools for the Yukon writes as follows:\n\n\"We have been receiving broadcasting records from Mr. Phillip J. Kitley, CBC, Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver. He is in charge of educational broadcasts, and would be glad to supply you with some, I am sure.

Mr. O'Meara on October 5, 1908, with reference to matters in the Yukon Territory.\n\nThe following matters considered by them to be of special importance:\n\nA boarding school at Selkirk.\n\nF.P.\nD.S.G.I.A.\nDepartment of Education, Yukon Territory,\nDawson, Y.T., Jan. 4, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nAt Selkirk there was also a serious diphtheria epidemic last fall, but the Indians have always attended so irregularly there that Archdeacon Canham has always considered it hopeless or worthless to attempt to make out any printed return.\nAn examination was held at the day school, all the work is elementary. There were 9 boys and 6 girls present at the time of the examination with Miss K. Martin, the teacher. The subjects in which the pupils were examined are as follows:\n\nREADING:- While each of the pupils were rather slow the pronunciation of the English words was clear with only a very little of the Indian accent, the meaning of the words was intelligently given, it may be said, taking the pupils as a whole, that the reading was very good.\n\nWRITING:- This is a subject that seems to appeal to all the Indians and one they seem most interested in consequently they make more progress in this than in most subjects. The pupils examined at Selkirk were very good the letters were well formed in a clear roundhand and very readable, there was marked progress by all pupils in this subject.\n\nARITHMETIC:- The examination in this branch was in both mental and written examples, all of course rudimentary, answers were readily and in most cases correctly given, their work in this subject was very satisfactory.\n\nSPELLING:- All the pupils were good up to words of four or five letters, the meaning of each word spelt was given, this system is regularly followed by the teacher.\n\nSINGING:- It is characteristic of the Indians that they are all fond of music consequently the singing was very good, the time accurate and the voices well modulated.\nThey sing one or two patriotic songs very creditably.\n\nCalisthenics: All the movements taken from the Manual sent by the Department were excellently done, they keep good time and drill to music.\n\nIt is evident that the teacher, Miss K. Martin, has taken a lot of pains with her pupils, they certainly reflect great credit on her efforts. The general work of the school was very satisfactory.\n\nThe school-room was neat and clean and well ventilated, good care is taken of the material and books supplied by the Department.\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDawson, Y.T.,\nMarch 21st, 1916.\nOttawa, April 13, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to that part of your report of the 21st ultimo on the Selkirk Day School I beg to say that the Department is glad to receive such a favourable report on this school and learn that the children are making good progress in their studies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. John Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nExtract from letter from Superintendent Hawksley, Dawson, Y.T., dated January 9th, 1919. Original on 297298/1.\n\nThe Rev. A. C. Field, who is on furlough just now is expected to return sometime this month and to take up his residence at Selkirk when he will re-open the Indian Day School which has been closed since Miss K. Martin resigned to take up War Work.\nSir:\n\nMiss K. Martin, the teacher of the Selkirk Indian day school, has sent in a request for a school register, the one she has will be filled up by the end of June.\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon has also written asking for a register for the Teslin Lake day school, a copy book was used last summer as there was no regular register. Mr. Davis, a student from Wycliffe College, Toronto, is coming to take charge of the Teslin Lake school for the summer.\n\nThe two registers recently sent were for Carcross Residential school and the Carmacks and Ross River school.\n\nWill you please forward two registers at your earliest convenience, both will be needed in June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDecember 22nd, 1926.\n\nMemo for File:\n\nBishop Stringer informs me that Miss K. Martin, teacher of the Selkirk Indian Day School, is fully qualified for her duties. I understand that she has Second Class Professional for the province of British Columbia.\n\nThis school should be treated as a regular Indian day school and the salary will be at the rate of $110.00 for the ten teaching months. The payments for rental will, of course, be discontinued.\n| Item       | Quantity | Description          | Price |\n|------------|----------|----------------------|-------|\n| Box White Chalk | 1        |                      | 2.00  |\n| Doz.

Mr. O.W.R. Hughes having completed his course at the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B.C., taking the prize for reading, was ordained on July 4th, and appointed to the charge of Selkirk and instructed by the Bishop to teach and keep the school open regularly in accordance with the requirements of the Department.\nDr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nDeputy Director General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Scott:\n\nI have an inquiry from Mrs. Kathleen M. Cowaret, of Fort Selkirk, Yukon, concerning her claim for teaching Indians at that point last winter.\n\nShe says she understood that John Hawksley, Indian Agent, was to have recommended the same but that it has never materialized.\n\nWill you kindly advise me whether such a claim was ever submitted to the Department and if so what disposition has been made of it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGB:MP\nDecember 16th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Speaker,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, I have been unable to locate any previous request for payment for Mrs. Cowaret's services as teacher of the Indian Day School at Fort Selkirk, Yukon.\n\nI am today writing Mr. Hawksley in order to ascertain the exact length of time Mrs. Cowaret was in charge of this school and, on receipt of his reply, favourable consideration will be given to allowing her some remuneration for her services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nHon. George Black,\nCrown Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 928-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department understands that Mrs. A. Cowaret was in charge of the Selkirk Indian Day School in the early part of this year.\n\nPlease let me know, at once, when she commenced duties and for what length of time she conducted the school. You should, also, indicate the number of days during this period that the school was open. The Department desires to give her some remuneration and, on receipt of your reply, I will be in a position to decide how much can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nDawson, Y.T. January 15th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated December 16th, 1931, file No 166-9-3, in reference to Mrs A. Cowaret teaching Indian day school at Selkirk in the early part of the year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when Mr W.D. Young left Selkirk I was notified that the school was closed, this was in August 1930. I had no knowledge of Mrs Cowaret commencing to teach or that she had continued to do so until March of last year when a letter was received from her stating that the Bishop of Yukon had been to Selkirk and finding that she had been teaching advised her to send in a report; she sent for the necessary forms which were sent to her. By letter dated July 7th she informed me that she had filled up the forms and hoped to hand them over to me in Whitehorse, she was on her way to Vancouver, but found I had already left for Dawson, she then mailed them to this office.\n\nEnquiries were made from the Bishop of Yukon as to whether he had engaged the services of Mrs Cowaret to teach. He stated that he had not done so nor did he know that she was doing so until he called at Selkirk on his way to Dawson. The work was quite a voluntary act undertaken without the knowledge or consent of the church authorities or the Indian Superintendent. It was felt that in paying for work voluntarily undertaken without the knowledge and consent of those immediately concerned there is the risk of establishing a precedent that might prove to be troublesome in the future.\n\nThe school register and school material was locked up in the Mission House and was not available to Mrs Cowaret. No school supplies were sent to Selkirk during the period that she was teaching, nor was any requisitioned by her.\n\nEnclosed herewith I am forwarding the school returns for\nperiod extending from October 1930 to the end of June 1931, which will supply the information asked for in your letter.\n\nThe Rev O.W.R. Hughes has been in charge of the Selkirk Indian Day School since September 1931.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 10, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Speaker:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of December 11th, concerning the claim of Mrs. Cowaret for teaching Indian children at Fort Selkirk, I now have a report from Mr. Superintendent Hawksley. It appears that Mrs. Cowaret taught for a total of 167 days during the past academic year. She was not engaged by either our local officers or the Bishop of the Yukon. The school register and school material were locked up and not available to her. She had an average attendance of nearly six Indian children during the nine months she taught.\n\nStrictly speaking, this lady has no claim on the Department and Mr. Hawksley fears that it might establish an unfortunate precedent if we paid for work voluntarily undertaken without the knowledge and consent of either the Church or the Department. Before I give the matter final consideration, I should like to have your opinion as to what should be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nHonourable George Black,\nSpeaker,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Ont.,\nFebruary 16th, 1932.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nReference 166-9-1.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant re Indian School at Fort Selkirk, Yukon. It is a pleasure to bear testimony to unselfish and devoted work performed by Mrs. Cowaret for the Indians at and in the vicinity of Fort Selkirk.\n\nI have observed her there for more than ten years past. Apart altogether from the performance of her formal duties as a school teacher, she has really become an institution among them; adults and children alike look to her for advice and guidance in their affairs. In such a remote and isolated place it is fortunate that there is such a sympathetic, refined and well informed woman willing to minister to the wants of those wretched people.\n\nMy understanding of this case is that Mrs. Cowaret did not originally intend seeking remuneration for the period of teaching, but that Bishop Stringer, now Archbishop, visiting Selkirk, becoming personally aware of the circumstances, suggested both to her and to the Indian Agent that she should be paid, and consequently request for payment was made.\n\nAs you have been good enough to ask my opinion in the matter, I have no hesitation in recommending that payment be made with the stipulation that it is not a precedent, and so far as Mrs. Cowaret is concerned, I am confident she would never seek to treat it as a precedent.\n\nFurther, Mrs. Cowaret's husband is a big game hunter's guide and trapper. Because of the general hard times, hunters did not visit the Yukon in 1931 as formerly. That coupled with the prevailing low price of fur has seriously crippled the Cowarets finan-\ncially and payment of the amount involved would be doubly welcome at this time.\n\nMrs. Cowaret is, in my opinion, really such a valuable asset to your department and a person upon whom you could always rely for support and if needed, could supply intelligent and sympathetic advice in matters pertaining to the welfare of the Indians in that country that if it is necessary, hers should be a special case and payment made without hesitation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 928-1, part 1)\nFebruary 18, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Speaker:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of the 16th instant, concerning the services of Mrs. Cowaret at the Selkirk Indian Day School. Although our funds are extremely limited, I have decided to make a payment of $2.50 per teaching day in her case. It is understood that, in future, the Department will not be responsible, unless the work is authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nHonourable George Black,\nSpeaker,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 19th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 1491-A of the 15th ultimo, with reference to Mrs. A. Cowaret teaching the Indian day school at Selkirk during the early part of last year.\n\nAfter carefully considering the matter, it has been decided to allow Mrs. Cowaret payment at the rate of $2.50 a teaching day and a cheque for the amount due at this rate will be issued in her favour and sent to you. It should be distinctly understood that, in future, the Department will not be responsible for payment of teaching services unless the work is authorized.\n\nIn your letter of June 2nd, last, you mentioned that Mr. O. W. R. Hughes would conduct a seasonal school at Selkirk during the summer of 1931 and a return was received for the September quarter and cheque was issued and sent to the Bishop of the Yukon.\n\nNo return has yet been received for the December quarter and I would appreciate your advising if Mr. Hughes is still in charge of the Selkirk School. I would, also, appreciate a report from you regarding the situation at this point, stating the number of children of school age. As you are aware, a teacher had been regularly in charge of this school up to the end of June, 1930, and you might let me know why the work was apparently discontinued after that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nOTTAWA, February 19, 1932.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,-\n\nI thank you very much for your letter of the 18th instant, in which you state that payment of $2.50 per teaching day is to be paid to Mrs. Cowaret, at the Selkirk Indian School.\n\nI know Mrs. Cowaret will be very grateful.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 928-1, part 1)\nDawson,Y.T. March 19th,1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated February 19th, file No 166-9-1,in reference to the payment for teaching services of Mrs K.M.Cowaret of Selkirk.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department's cheque No 6670, amount $417.50,has been forwarded to Mrs Cowaret.\n\nRegarding the Selkirk day school, the teacher, Mr W.D.Young, resigned in June 1930. Some difficulty was experienced by the Bishop of Yukon in obtaining someone to take the vacant position so the school had to be closed at the end of the June quarter 1930. Mrs Cowaret, a former teacher residing in Selkirk, opened a school on her own authority for the natives. In June 1931 Mr O.W.R.Hughes was appointed as teacher, later on he was ordained and appointed missionary in charge of Selkirk, he has regularly carried on the day school since. The returns for the December quarter have been forwarded to the Department.\n\nThe number of children of school age in the vicinity of Selkirk is 30. Owing to the nomadic habits of the parents the children are not continually within reach of the school this causes the attendance to be rather irregular and the daily average rather low. The children attend the school fairly regularly when living near the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.Mackenzie,Esq.\nSecretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the Rev O.W.R. Hughes of Selkirk has been transferred to Carcross, not in connection with the Residential School, and that his place has been filled by the appointment of the Rev Arthur Richard Parsons who will take over the teaching duties at the Selkirk Indian Day School.\n\nMr Parsons was born in Lincolnshire, England. He is 36 years of age. Served overseas during the War with the London Rifle Brigade. Was awarded the Military Medal for bravery. He is a graduate of the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B.C. Has taught in several Indian communities in the northern part of British Columbia. I believe the change will be beneficial to the Selkirk School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 3, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter returns of the Moosehide and Selkirk Indian Day Schools. The enrolment at Moosehide was 8, with an average attendance of 6, while the enrolment at Selkirk was 9, with an average attendance of 4.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has been allowing salary at the rate of $110 per teaching month, less 10%, for the teacher at each of these schools. In view of the attendance, however, it is felt that this salary is rather high.\n\nI would appreciate receiving a full report regarding the attendance both at Moosehide and Selkirk. You should state if all the Indian children living at these points are enrolled at the day schools and what steps, if any, could be taken to increase the attendance.\n\nIf the attendance cannot be increased, the Department would appreciate an expression of your views regarding a reduction in the salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nCarcross, Y.T.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated August 3rd, file No 166-9-1, in reference to the Moosehide and Selkirk Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there is little prospect of an increased enrollment of pupils at either of these day schools. The Indians, owing to changed conditions, cannot afford to stay around these villages or leave their families while the men go away to hunt and trap; they are compelled to separate into small parties and live in the woods for the purpose of hunting and trapping in order to make a living. Opportunities for obtaining work from the white people are very much reduced. To insist upon the Indian families staying in the village (which has been suggested) would mean that some of them would have to receive help in the way of provisions. It appears to be a much wiser policy to keep them independent, earning their own living, and they are less liable to get into bad habits.\n\nAt both places all the children who live in the village of school age are enrolled but do not attend as regularly as they should, possibly a little more effort on the part of the teachers might help towards improvement in the attendance of those enrolled.\n\nThe salary paid by the Department, $110.00 per month for the ten teaching months of the school year for each of these schools is rather too high for the number of pupils taught and I would recommend that a reduction be made in view of the urgent need for economy. May I suggest that under existing circumstances, a net salary of $75.00 per month for each of these two schools would be adequate compensation for the work that is being done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

Wm. Valentine and I shall be most grateful if you will appoint him the teacher of the Day School at that place. During the month of June both Mr. Parsons and Mr Valentine were at Selkirk and carried on the school work.\n\nAs I understand that the cheque for the June has not yet been issued I shall be grateful if you will issue the cheque for that month to Mr. Valentine.\n\nI have asked Mr. Valentine to forward to you the usual Quarterly returns.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.A.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves the appointment of Rev. Wm. Valentine as teacher of the Selkirk Indian Day School. It is noted that he has been in charge of this school since the first of May. When issuing salary cheques for the month ended November 30th, payment will be made to Rev. Mr. Valentine for the months of June, September, October and November.\n\nThe salary rate at this school is $1,100 a year but, owing to present regulations, when the total compensation exceeds $1,000 but is not in excess of $1,111, the Department is only allowed to pay at the rate of $1,000 a year. Consequently, until further notice, Rev. Mr. Valentine's compensation will be at the rate of $100 a teaching month, as all salaries of teachers of Indian day schools are paid on the basis of ten teaching months in the academic year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Geddes, Bishop of Yukon, the Department is approving the appointment of Rev. Wm. Valentine as teacher of the Selkirk Indian Day School. The Department understands that he began duties at this school on May first, last. Until further notice, his salary will be at the rate of $100 a teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Mr. Parsons, and he has sent you since assuming his duties at Selkirk quarterly reports at the end of June and the end of September. These, I suppose, were forwarded by you to the Department at Ottawa. It is therefore a matter of surprise that no payment should have been forthcoming before this.\n\nAs the Department no longer issues cheques on account of the service of maintaining the school and supplying the teacher at Selkirk direct to the Diocese, but makes them payable to the teacher, I am passing this enquiry through you, and I should be much obliged if you would kindly take the matter up with the proper officials.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed)\n\n\"A.

L.G.Chappell, who was the teacher at Moosehide Indian Day School last year, left Moosehide at the end of August with his family intending to proceed to England. On account of the outbreak of war he had to return to Yukon. The only point in Yukon where I had a house suitable for a family was at Selkirk, so I have had to locate him there. I shall be grateful therefore if he could be appointed as teacher at Selkirk from Jan. 1st, or if this letter reaches you too late to make the change as from that date, then from Feb. 1st.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nW.A.Geddes\nBishop of Yukon\n\n[Handwritten note]\nRev. R.C. Wurd - at Selkirk\nMoosehide - Valentine found here\nJune 1941\nOttawa,\nJanuary 15, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant recommending the appointment of Rev. L. G. Chappell as teacher of the Selkirk Indian Day School.\n\nOur records show that Rev. R.C. Ward is in charge of the Selkirk School and he has been paid salary to December 31, 1939. Is it your intention to dispense with the services of Mr. Ward?\n\nOur records also show that Rev. Wm. Valentine is teacher at Moosehide and he has also been paid to December 31, 1939. Please let me know if he is still in charge of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W. A. Geddes, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon,\nJanuary 24, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of January 15th in reply to my letter of January 4th. I fear I did not make myself very clear in my letter to you.\n\nMr Valentine is still at Moosehide, and will be remaining there I hope for at least the next five years. When he took over at Moosehide at the end of August, Mr Chappell left with his family to return to England. He had only got as far as Whitehorse when war was declared and it was impossible for him to proceed to the mother country. I tried to find work for him in British Columbia but was unsuccessful. The only house that I had in Yukon that was suitable for a married man and that was available was at Selkirk where Mr Ward, a bachelor was stationed. I have therefore been compelled to ask Mr Chappell to go to Selkirk and ask Mr Ward to work among the Indians at [Carmacks]. As far as I can foresee the matter at present I am hoping that Mr Ward will be returning to Selkirk. But in these uncertain times it is hard to tell when that will be. It is for this reason that I have asked that Mr Chappell be appointed as teacher at [Selkirk] in the place of Mr. Ward.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in connection with the teaching services at the Selkirk School.\n\nI should appreciate your advising me at once the exact date on which Mr. Ward gave up duties at Selkirk, also the exact date on which Mr. Chappell took charge of the school. We have no objection to the latter's employment as teacher of the Selkirk School but we require the information asked for in the preceding sentence in order that the necessary adjustments may be made in our pay list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt.

As he and Mr Ward were there for a time together It is possible that he may have taken over before Mr. Ward left.\n\nAs I think I have already stated when I sent Mr. Chappell to Selkirk I hoped that his stay there would be only a few weeks.

On the recommendation of His Lordship Bishop Geddes Rev. Mr. Stringer was appointed teacher of the Selkirk Indian Day School for the academic year 1942. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of October 5, 1942. We have received no previous information either from the Bishop or yourself that Mr. Stringer had given up duties at Selkirk Day School and consequently his cheque has gone forward regularly to him since the start of the current academic year; namely, for the months of September, October and November. If we are correct in assuming from the information in your letter that Mr. Stringer has not been teaching the Selkirk School this fall, it would be appreciated if you would arrange with him immediately to return the cheques which he has received for the three months mentioned above.\n\nR.A.

To date I have not heard from him.\n\nMay I say that I have not received any official intimation either from the Department or from the Diocese that Mr. Stringer had given up duties at Selkirk Day School although of course, I know that he is spending the Winter in Dawson.\n\nIt is not clear to me that I have any responsibility in connection with the day school teachers. They are apparently engaged by the Department and they appear to be moved around from one place to another without reference to the Indian Agent. Some of the salary cheques are mailed in my care and others, it would appear, go direct to the teacher. Personally I do not see any point in mailing cheques to me as I simply have to place them in another envelope and re-address to Fort Selkirk or Old Crow as the case may be.\n\nI think perhaps it would be advisable for the Department to take up with the Reverend Mr. Stringer direct the matter of salary refund.\n\nJ.E.

The Department inferred from the last paragraph of this letter that Reverend Mr. Stringer had given up duties at the Selkirk Indian Day School on September 30 and consequently we wrote to the Agent, but before receiving the Agent's letter we had already issued the cheques for the months of October and November. We, therefore, wrote to the Indian Agent on December 7 requesting him to communicate with Reverend Mr. Stringer and have him return the cheques for the latter two months.\n\nIn a letter dated December 27 which reached us today Mr. Gibben states that he communicated with Mr. Stringer asking him to call at the Indian office, but that up to the date of the letter Mr. Stringer had not come. It would be appreciated if you would let me know exactly the situation at Selkirk. Is Mr. Stringer teaching the school? If so, he is, of course, entitled to the salary, but at the same time it is difficult for the Department to understand how he can teach the school and still reside at the St. Paul's Hostel in Dawson.\n\nAn immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Yukon,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, inclosing the June Quarterly Return of the Selkirk Day School. It is noted that this return is signed by Reverend W.R. Stringer.\n\nThis is the first intimation that we have received that Reverend Mr. Stringer had returned to this school. We understood from your letter of December 27, 1943 that Reverend Mr. Stringer had given up duties at Selkirk school. Early this year we forwarded him a cheque for $62.17 being the refund of the amount to his credit in the Retirement Fund account. Please let me know the exact date on which Reverend Mr. Stringer re-opened the Selkirk school. Is it his intention to continue in charge of this school for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDawson, Y.

Actually, I am in about the same position as I was when I wrote you on December 27, 1943. Officially I do not know when Rev. W. R. Stringer resumed the work of Day School Teacher at Selkirk, although I do know that he left Dawson, I think, by the first boat in May, 1944. I do not know whether it is his intention to continue in charge of the school for the academic year 1944-45; perhaps the Department would be more successful than I have been in eliciting information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Before paying Reverend Mr. Stringer I should appreciate further information regarding the period during which he taught the Selkirk School during the September quarter. With regard to this, you will remember that we wrote to you on September 20 and you replied in a letter dated October 11. At that time you did not have definite information regarding Mr. Stringer's employment. Evidently you must have received subsequent information, as you have signed the September return certifying it as correct. A review of this return indicates that the school was open for approximately ten days during the month of September. As intimated above, I would like to know how many days the school was open in the June quarter. I should also like to know if the school continued in operation during the December quarter and if it is Mr. Stringer's intention to remain at the school for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFort Selkirk, Y.T.,\nJanuary 26, 1945.\n\nJ.

Gibben,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson,\nY.T.\n\nDear Mr. Gibben,\n\nWith reference to our conversation this afternoon regarding the Indian Day Schools in Yukon, I wish to furnish you with the following information.\n\nRegarding the Selkirk Day School; Rev. W. R. Stringer returned to Selkirk on May 30th last and has been stationed there ever since. When he came to Selkirk in 1942 he intended to remain there for five years and I have had as yet no information that he contemplates any change in this plan.\n\nRegarding the Teslin Day School; at the end of September it appeared that there would not be any Indians remaining at the Post throughout the winter, so Mrs. Cowaret moved to Carmacks. If there are children at Carmacks, Mrs. Cowaret will be conducting a Day School and if so I would appreciate it if the Indian Affairs Branch could provide some remuneration for her services in that regard.\n\nWith regard to Old Crow, a letter recently received from Rev. J. W. Ellis states that on account of the epidemic prevailing there this summer it was impossible to have the school opened.\n\nI understand that the Indian Affairs Branch has approved the temporary appointment of James Wood as teacher for the Mooseshide Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. A. Geddes (Sgd.)\nBishop of Yukon\nDawson, Y. T.,\nFebruary 3, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Division, Welfare and Training Service, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nYour File: 166-9-1.\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of January 2, the writer thought it advisable to obtain a summary of information regarding Indian Day Schools under Diocesan supervision.\n\nFor your information I enclose herewith:\n\n(1) Copy of letter received from Bishop W. A. Geddes under date January 11, 1945.\n\n(2) Copy of letter received from Rev. W. A. Stringer under date January 26, 1945.\n\nWith regard to Bishop Geddes's suggestion as to a possible Day School at Carmacks, I have written Mrs. Cowaret for information regarding this.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 14th, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Selkirk Indian Day School\nNo. 928,\n\nThis school was re-opened on June 1st, 1944, with the previous teacher, Rev.

R. Stringer, Teacher of the above school has just received his Salary cheque covering the months of October 1945 to February 1946 inclusive. From this cheque a gross income tax deduction of $57.00 was made, a monthly deduction of $11.40.\n\nFor the School term ending June 30th 1945, and for the month of September 1945 the monthly tax deduction for this teacher was $2.90, which was the correct deduction for a married man with one dependent receiving a gross monthly salary of $118.42. A new scale of Income Tax Deductions went into effect on October 1st 1945 and according to the Table of Income Tax Deductions issued by the Department of National Revenue, and according to this table the proper monthly deduction from the salary of a man receiving monthly $118.42 being married and having one dependent is $2.40. I should appreciate some explanation as to why the monthly deductions from Mr. Stringer's salary are being made at a rate $9.00 above the authorised scale.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. A.

T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE: SELKIRK DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis is to inform you that Mr. G. C. Robertson is teaching the Selkirk Day School for the month of June. Mr. Robertson is a graduate of San Mateo Junior College in California, and completed 3 years of a four years course at San Jose Teachers College also in California. Mr. Robertson left college at the end of his third year to enlist in the Canadian Army and served for four and one half years with the Seaforth Highlanders from Vancouver. He served in Canada, England, and also in the Mediterranean and Western European theaters of war. On his discharge from the army he entered the Anglican Theological College of Vancouver. He is spending the summer in Yukon. It would be appreciated if Mr. Robertson could be paid either on a monthly or a per diem basis for the month of June.\n\nMr. Stringer did not teach during the month of May as there were no children in Selkirk during the month. In order to compensate for this Mr. Robertson proposes to teach during July if there are children in Selkirk.\n\nFrom the term beginning September 1st next I shall be pleased if the Department will appoint Mrs. M. M. Cowaret as teacher of the Selkirk School. Mrs. Cowaret has had years of experience in teaching in Indian Day Schools at Selkirk and elsewhere in Yukon and has the added advantage in that she speaks the language of the Selkirk Indians.\n\nA new building to house the Day School at Selkirk is badly needed. Could the Department erect a new building for the Day School at Selkirk next year or provide any assistance towards its construction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. A. Geddes (Sgd.)\nBishop of Yukon\nDawson, Y. T.,\nJune 20th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Selkirk Day School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received today from Bishop W.

Robertson was in charge of the Selkirk School for the month of June. It is noted also that Bishop Geddes suggests that the school be kept in operation for the months of July and August, although there is some doubt if there will be any children present.\n\nYou should advise me, later, the exact number of months that Mr. Robertson is in charge of the school during the present summer.\n\nThe appointment of Mrs. K. M. Cowaret as teacher of this school, effective September 1, 1946, is approved.

Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nInspector's Report - Selkirk Indian Day School\n\nIn his report upon the work of Mrs. Kathleen Martin Cowaret, Major Clark makes the following comments:\n\n\"Mrs. Cowaret has been employed for many years before and since her marriage in the dual role of mission worker and teacher. She needs a refresher course in fundamentals and a reorientation in the philosophy of education.\n\n\"The building intended for school purposes is no longer used as a school. The reason advanced - \"dilapidation\". Provision is made for two white children (Donald Cook, 8 and Stanley Wilcox, 6) in the post office which Mrs. Cowaret manages. No satisfactory explanation was forthcoming concerning where the Indian children would sit if they happened to attend.\n\n\"If it is worthwhile paying a teacher, it should be in order to repair the school to make it usable. The agent should be instructed to visit this settlement, and school frequently and to insure that the public is getting a reasonable return for the money expended for school purposes.\"\n\nOur attendance records for this school show the following figures during the last four quarters:\n\nQuarter Ended June, 1946-------- 19\n\" Sept. 1947-------- 12\n\" Dec. 1947 -------- 18\n\" Mch. 1947 -------- 12\nWe would appreciate your comments upon the situation, especially as to the advisability of continuing to operate this school.\n\nWhile it will be impossible to erect a new school at this point this year, we should keep in mind the possibility of including it in our next year's estimates.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nYour letter of June 24th, file 166-9-1 (WT), concerning Selkirk Indian Day School. The observations of Major C.A.F. Clark concerning Mrs. K.M. Cowaret have been noted. The official attitude of the Branch was conveyed to Bishop Gibson, Prince Rupert, B.C., and Archbishop W.R. Adams, Vernon, B.C., both of whom visited Whitehorse recently. Archbishop Adam visited the school at Fort Selkirk, and informs me that he has set aside $100.00 for the repair of the school building. I have therefor included the sum of $100.00 in the estimates of 1948-49 for the repair of Fort Selkirk School, (additional to the Diocese).\n\nI have now been informed by Canon L.G. Chappell that several changes are contemplated at Fort Selkirk by the Diocese. There is a possibility that a new and much larger building may be obtained, and a possible change in personnel.\n\nThe recommendation in your fourth paragraph is noted, that more frequent trips be made to Fort Selkirk. Not only Selkirk but many other points I believe would benefit by an occasional visit and inspection by the Agent, but it is impossible to do all the work requested, both inside and in the field, without a clerk being appointed. A considerable proportion of my work the last two months has been taken up with Indian Health Services matters and I have only been able to visit a fraction of the places I would like this summer. A Public Health Nurse has now been appointed by Dr. E.L. Stone, who will spend most of her time along the Yukon River, and it is hoped that by her frequent visits to Selkirk, Miss Larkin will keep me informed as to conditions there.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nColonel Regry\n\nNurse's Report on Yukon Schools:\n\nIn his letter of 26 Aug., Mr. Indian Agent Meek expresses the hope that the north Yukon nurse will supply information about the schools she visits.\n\nOn an accompanying file (11-283-1) appears her first report to the Indian Health Services. From her diary it appears that she is in Selkirk October 1-7 and that Mrs. Cowart had five pupils on Monday Oct. 6, but in what building they work is not stated.\n\nPlease note the glimpses of Moosehide School and Dawson.\n\n\"16: 'Dawson Handicraft Shop.'\n\n\"At least 8 children should be at school.\"\n\n\"20: 'Vaccine given to school children.' The large number causes me to wonder, 'Where?'\"\n\n\"24: 'Visited one...Indian...house...well cared for.'\n\nProbably Mrs. Tizyde\n\n\"27: 'part way over Moosehide Trail.' To go all the way is quite a feat.\"\n\nC.A. Clark\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting Fort Selkirk (Y.T.) Indian Day School\nfor the month January 1943\n\nName of Teacher Mrs. K.

Requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., should be the subject of separate communications.\n\nThe Indians of this district are nomadic in the extreme; they seldom stay more than a few days, but generally the children attend school when they are in the Post. Mrs. Cowaret speaks the native dialect and has considerable influence over the Indians.\n\nAgency Yukon Indian Agent\n\nI.A. 407\nR. 3043\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 928-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nR.

The school building,\nas has been noted by Major C.A.F. Clark, is not now in\nuse owing to its very dilapidated condition. The\narrangement appeared to be satisfactory considering\nthe very small average attendance.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nPerhaps Mr. Meek could\nsuggest a settlement where\nMrs. Cowaret could have more pupils care.\nOttawa, March 17, 1948.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe received your letter of the 23rd ultimo in which you stated that there are only two pupils at the Fort Selkirk Indian Day School.\n\nI think you will agree that the Department is not justified in operating a school for only two pupils and one of those is a white person. Major Clark thought that possibly you could suggest some other Indian school in the Yukon where Mrs. Cowaret's services would be more useful and where there is a larger attendance.\n\nPlease let me hear from you at your convenience.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n| Quarter Ending | Enrollment | Day School Attendance | Average Attendance |\n|----------------|------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| June 30, 1946  | 19         | 292                   | 5.12               |\n| Sept 30, 1946  | 12         | 90                    | 4.28               |\n| Dec 31, 1946   | 16         | 296                   | 5.10               |\n| Including 2 white children | 18 | 320 | 5.52 |\n| March 31, 1947 | 10         | 269                   | 4.34               |\n| Including 2 white children | 12 | 373 | 6.01 |\n| June 30, 1947  | 6          | 25                    | 4.4                |\n| Including 3 white children | 9 | 122 | 2.14 |\n| Sept 30, 1947  | 13         | 84                    | 2.63               |\n| Including 2 white children | 15 | 124 | 3.87 |\n| Dec 31, 1947   | 14         | 385                   | 6.75               |\n| Including 1 white child | 15 | 437 | 7.66 |\n| March 31, 1948 | 10         | 115                   | 1.98               |\n| Including 1 white child | 11 | 146 | 2.51 |\nYour letter of March 17th, your file 166-9-1 (E.1), re Fort Selkirk Indian Day School.\n\nThe matter of moving Mrs. Cowaret to some other school has been gone into, and it does not appear to be in the best interests of Indian Affairs Branch and the Diocese to have Mrs. Cowaret moved at the present time.\n\nI think the only solution is to close the Fort Selkirk Indian Day School until changed conditions warrant the reopening of a school. Perhaps by that time, the old school building will be torn down if it doesn't fall down first. We will then be able to open an Indian (or joint) Day School starting with a clean slate.\n\n(R.J.

ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDIOCESE OF YUKON\n\nDawson, Yukon, Canada March 15, 1911.\n\nT.G. Bragg, Esq.,\nSupt. of Schools, Yukon,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith the following school returns for Indian schools, to be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs:\n\nReport of Teslin Lake Indian School from July 8th to August 26th 1910. Teacher C.C. Brett.\n\nReport of School at Champagne Landing for five days in the quarter ending Sept. 30th 1910. Teacher C.C. Brett.\n\nAlso reports for the three schools at Selkirk, Whitehorse and Champagne Landing for the quarter ending Dec. 31st 1910. Teachers being John Hawksley, William G. Blackwell and C.C. Brett respectively.\n\nI have already handed you the report of Moosehide School for the quarter ending Dec. 31st, 1910. Teacher B. Totty.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nI.O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\nchange then, thought that no regular return of attendance was possible or at any rate, that a return would be of little value.\n\nI understand that the Bishop has arranged that Rev. C.C. Brett shall alternate between Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing, being at the former point during the summer months, and at the latter during the winter, such an arrangement being adapted to the movements of the Indians. You will, therefore, understand why the schools at these two points cannot furnish regular reports throughout the year.\n\nThe Indian School at Whitehorse was opened in November 1910, and has been well attended. I have not yet visited this school as I made only last trip to Whitehorse in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.G. Bragg\nSuperintendent of Schools\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith returns of attendance of various Indian schools conducted in connection with Church of England missions under the direction of Bishop D.O. Stringer.\n\nIn addition to the two former schools at Carcross and Moosehide, returns of which have been transmitted by you in previous years, the Bishop has arranged for schools recently at Selkirk Lake, Whitehorse, and Champagne Landing (returns of which are herewith enclosed) and has also furnished a return for the school at Delkirk, where the attendance has for years been so scattered and irregular that Archdeacon Carham, formerly...\nSir:\n\nDuring a recent visit to Whitehorse I found that the wife of the recently appointed Rector, the Rev. I.D. Daimpre, had opened a day school for Indian children with a daily attendance of 13 pupils. A neat schoolroom has been fitted up at the back of the Rectory which is quite suitable for the work.\n\nAn application has been made for a supply of school material also for the usual per diem grant allowed by the Department for such schools.\n\nMrs. Daimpre, the teacher, has had Normal School and College training and before her marriage was Supervisor of Schools in several cities in the State of Massachusetts. She has also taught the Indian day school at Kitkatla, B.C.\n\nWill you please be good enough to notify me if the Department is willing to make the per diem grant and whether a limited supply of school material is to be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department that during your recent visit to Whitehorse you found a day school being conducted for Indian children under the charge of Mrs. I. D. Daimpre, with a daily attendance of 13 pupils, and requesting the usual per diem grant and the necessary supply of school material.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will state whether this school will be conducted regularly or whether it is a seasonal activity. Please also state whether the Indians reside permanently at this school or whether they go to Champagne Landing or another point during the winter months. You should also state whether any white or half-breed children attend. When the Department has the information asked for above regarding this activity, consideration will be given to the providing of a grant in payment of the teacher's services.\n\nIf the teacher will prepare a requisition for the classroom supplies required, and forward same through your office, consideration will be given to the furnishing of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Haysley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDawson,Y.T.October 29th,1927.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of attendance at the Whitehorse Indian day school for the quarter ending September 30th,1927.\n\nThis school was re-opened on July 26th, the wife of the Rector of Whitehorse, Mrs G.H. Daimpre, taking teaching duties, she has done good work up to date.\n\nIf the Department is willing to recognize this school will you please forward a Register at your earliest convenience.\n\nThe teacher has sent in a requisition for school supplies which will, according to instructions, be purchased locally when the school is authorized.\n\nAn inspection of the premises in use as a schoolroom was made and found to be suitable for the purpose. It is hoped that favorable consideration will be given in this case which I have no hesitation in recommending.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.F. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 26th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a return showing the attendance at the Whitehorse School for the quarter ended September 30th, 1927. A letter, dated the 21st ultimo, was directed to you in reply to your letter of September 30th. When the information requested in our letter is received, the Department will be in a position to decide if salary can be paid this teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated October 21st, file No 166-8-1, in reference to the Indian day school at Whitehorse conducted by Mrs I.D. Daimpre, wife of the Rector of Whitehorse.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is the intention of the teacher to operate this school throughout the year whenever there are pupils to attend. There are times when the Indian families are compelled to be away for hunting and trapping therefore there will be periods when pupils will not be available.\n\nThe Indians are resident in the vicinity of Whitehorse, they have permanent cabins there it is their headquarters. The half-breeds and white children attend the public school in the town.\n\nThe pupils enrolled on the quarterly returns, which have been forwarded to the Department, do not attend any other Indian school. It will be noted that they were attending the Whitehorse school at the same time that the Champagne school was in operation. The latter school is the nearest Indian school it is 64 miles away.\n\nThree previous Rectors of Whitehorse operated an Indian school but latterly it has been allowed to drop until the arrival of the Rev I.D. Daimpre and his wife who are both very\nkeenly interested in the Indians.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending the re-opening of this school if at all possible.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a requisition for school material sent here by Mrs Daimpre who states that she has been using her own supplies and that these supplies are almost used up.\n\nEnclos.1.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 20th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the Indian day school at White Horse conducted by Mrs. Daimpre. In reviewing the return forwarded for the September quarter, it is noted that the average attendance was only four and this number hardly warrants paying salary. When you forward a return for the December quarter, further consideration will be given to the question of what remuneration can be allowed to Mrs. Daimpre. In sending this return, you might note on it the names of any children who are not Indians.\n\nOwing to the expense involved in forwarding supplies and the uncertainty of mail facilities at the present season of the year, the Department considers that it would be advisable for you to purchase and forward to the school whatever supplies you consider are really required. I enclose, for your guidance, the list which Mrs. Daimpre prepared. If this school is in operation next year, you might arrange to have a requisition forwarded early in May so that supplies can be sent in during the summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated December 20th, 1927, file No 166-8-1, in reference to the Whitehorse Indian day school with returned requisition for school material enclosed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the teacher, Mr. Paimpre, has been informed of the Department's policy in regard to the question of remuneration for her services. She has been instructed to purchase, from the local store, a limited amount of supplies that may be necessary to carry on the work. It would be too expensive to purchase the material here and ship it to Whitehorse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.P. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of attendance at the Whitehorse Indian Day School for the quarter ending December 31st, 1927.\n\nThe teacher has been notified that the school returns must be sent in promptly at the close of each quarter. The report came to hand today.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th ultimo, enclosing a return showing the attendance at the Whitehorse Day School for the quarter ended December 31st last.\n\nIn reviewing this return, I find that, while the names of fourteen children are shown, only three of them attended for more than one third of the quarter. In view of the poor attendance, the Department is hardly warranted in placing the teacher of this school on a regular salary basis. However, to recognize the work she is doing with the children, I am prepared to allow her payment at the rate of $20.00 a teaching month, from October 1st, 1927, for each month that the school is in operation. Please let me know if this arrangement would be satisfactory and, also, state to whom the cheque should be sent. When salary for the teacher at this school was previously allowed, the cheque was sent to the Bishop of Yukon but, possibly, as it is intended now to allow only a small grant, it would be advisable to send the cheque direct to Mrs. Daimpre.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDawson, Y.T. April 5th, 1928.\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated March 8th, file No 166-3-1, in reference to the Whitehorse Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have written Mrs Daimpre informing her that the Department is prepared to allow a payment at the rate of $20.00 a teaching month from October 1st, 1927, for each month the school was in operation.\n\nAt this time of the year it takes a month to get a reply from Whitehorse, will send on her reply as soon as received. In the meantime I would suggest that payment for services rendered at the school be paid at the proposed rate of $20.00 per month. The cheque should be sent, as formerly, to the Bishop of Yukon, Dawson, Y.T. This method would be in accord with the regulations of the Diocese.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\n\nJ.B.

I have therefore to inform you that the Department will be unable to provide any grant towards the salary of the teachers at the following schools conducted under your auspices in the Yukon territory; viz.:\n\nTeslin Lake,\nWhitehorse,\nRampart House,\nChampagne Landing.\n\nThe only day schools in the Yukon territory for which the Department can provide a grant for teachers' salaries are Moosehide and Selkirk.

This is a seasonal school only and no authority was given for its operation other than during the summer months of 1939. Consequently no payment can be made to the teacher for the period he kept the school open during March.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA/Supt. T.V. Sandys-Wunsch,\nAgent for Indian Affairs,\nDawson, Y.T.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo which refers to the Whitehorse Seasonal School, I find that we have received a return from Mr. Anderson showing that the school was in operation for a period of 53 days at the rate of $3.00 a teaching day, plus bonus. We have issued a cheque for $159.00 which has been sent to Mr. A. Coldrick, Financial Secretary of the Diocese of Yukon, Dawson, Y.T. I enclose forms which the teacher should also complete and send to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nExtract from Dr. McGill's letter of November 21, 1942, addressed to Rt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, D.D., Bishop of Yukon, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI am disposed to think that some misunderstanding has arisen in respect to the operation of seasonal schools in the Yukon Territory. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the grants usually made to these schools have been withdrawn at any time. In the estimates of this year I note that provision has been made for the operation of the following schools: Champagne Landing, Old Crow Village, Rampart House, Teslin Lake and Whitehorse, in addition to the two more or less regular schools at Moosehide and Selkirk. The total amount set apart for the operation of these schools is $3,790.\n\nExtract from reply dated December 17, 1942, received from Bishop Geddes.\n\nI am a little concerned about the first paragraph in your letter regarding grants for the Seasonal Day Schools operated by our Church at Teslin, Champagne and Whitehorse. These three schools have been operated by our Church during the past three summers but we have been unable to receive the grants from your Department that formerly were paid. In fact in 1940 when the return for the Teslin Day School was forwarded to Ottawa it was returned with the notification that no grant would be paid. I gather from your letter that the funds for these schools are in the estimates that have been approved by Parliament and I shall be grateful if you can advise me as to how we can secure the grants for these schools that we have been operating.\nR.A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been approached by the Rev. H.I. Lee, minister of an interdenominational organization in Whitehorse re starting an Indian day school. Rev. Lee was formerly a member of the R.C.M.P., he was ordained in 1942 in Alberta, and is Canadian-born. He established a Protestant mission in Whitehorse last June, and conducts services for Indians as well as whites.\n\nAt present there is no day school for Indians in Whitehorse, though there are two for white children. Consequently Indian children of all ages wander about the streets of the town most hours of the day and part of the night. Rev. Lee has noted these conditions and has offered the use of his mission for a day school. The building would hold approximately 40 children. One teacher only would be necessary and Rev. Lee has two experienced teachers available at any time for classes.\n\nHis request is for sanction of Indian Affairs Branch. No salary is asked for teachers' services, but Rev. Lee would require schooldesks, blackboards, standard school books and equipment for grades 1 to 4. No religious teaching would make up the curriculum, simply standard grad-school subjects.\n\nRev. Lee acknowledges that this school would be in the nature of an experiment and is willing to undertake responsibility of the entire activity. There is at present a Roman Catholic day school here, upon making enquiries I find that it will be used for white children only - classes are expected to start in October. Rev. Lee's offer appears timely and would do much to better conditions among local Indians. What is the policy of Indian Affairs Branch, and what shall I advise Rev. Lee?\n\nR.J. Meek\n(P.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 13, 1946.\n\nWhitehorse Indian Day School\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has been received from Mr. R. J. Meek, Acting Indian Agent at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, concerning the above school.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you with regard to this letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend W. A. Geddes, B.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nSee House, Dawson City, Yukon.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDay School, Whitehorse.\n\nFurther to my letter of 5th ultimo re Rev. H.I. Lee and his request for Departmental sanction in starting a Day School for Indians in Whitehorse.\n\nThe Rev. Lee has again approached me and states that he has obtained from War Assets Corp. a large building 120 x 20, which could be made available for Day School purposes. The building is well lighted, fully equipped with electric lights, and double plumbing. There are however, no other facilities or equipment such as benches or blackboards.\n\nRev. Lee tells me he visited four typical Indian families in Whitehorse recently, these four families had 12 children of school age. According to my copy of the 1941 census, there are 66 children of school age in Whitehorse. At the present time it is probable that there are more, due to the movement of Indians into Whitehorse during the construction boom.\n\nChief Jim Boss of the Whitehorse Indians has been approached on this subject, and he appears to favor the idea, particularly in view of the fact that no school facilities have been available for the Indians here for a number of years.\n\nI might point out that Rev. Lee appears very anxious to do all in his power to assist the local Indians. A Day School in Whitehorse for Indians (most of the children have never been to school) would certainly be a great step towards the prime requisite of Indian needs - education.\n\nR.J. Meek\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 19 October 1946.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWHITEHORSE, Yukon Territory.\n\nWe have received your letters of Sept. 5th and Oct. 14th with reference to the desire of Rev. H.I. Lee to open an Indian School at Whitehorse.\n\nFor many years we have operated day schools with the co-operation of the Church of England, Presbyterian Church, United Church and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWe understood from your letter of Sept. 5th, that the children who would attend the school at Whitehorse if it were opened were Protestants and consequently we wrote to Right Reverend W.A. Geddes, Church of England Bishop of the Yukon. We have not yet received any reply from him and no action will be taken regarding Mr. Lee's request until we hear from Bishop Geddes.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nDay School, Whitehorse\n\nFurther to my letters of Sept. 5th, and Oct. 14th, 1946, and your reply of Oct. 19th, file 166-8-1 (W.R. 1). The Rev. H.I. Lee opened a day school for the Indian children of Whitehorse on Monday, January 13th, 1947. Both War Assets Corporation and the Canadian Army, at Whitehorse, have given him considerable assistance as to the acquiring of a building, plumbing and electric facilities, heating units and furniture.\n\nAt the present time there are 15 pupils and a strong possibility of several more. Several parents are not sending their children back to the Carcross Residential School as a consequence of the opening of a day school at Whitehorse. This has a beneficial effect insofar as accommodating orphans, and children in very remote places are concerned. I have four such requests for admission before me at present.\n\nWhile the Rev. Lee has proceeded with the organization of the day school on his own initiative, he is receiving the backing and moral support of the local Kiwanis Club and the Men's Council of Whitehorse. The parents are buying scribblers, pencils, pen, ink, etc., for their children.\n\nIt is hoped that recognition and support may be extended to Rev. Lee in the near future.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nActing Indian Agent.\nA situation has arisen in Whitehorse which is becoming somewhat embarrassing to myself as Indian Agent. For quite a number of years no school facilities have been available to the Indians of this village, the Carcross Residential School being the only one to which they had access. The Rev. H.J. Lee, minister of an interdenominational church in Whitehorse has now opened a mission school for the Indians.\n\nOn Sept. 5th and Oct. 14th I wrote Indian Affairs Branch requesting some form of recognition or assistance. On Oct. 19, (file 166-8-1 (W.T. 1)) B.F. Neary, Supt. of Welfare and Training, wrote me that he had entered communication with Right Rev. W.A. Gedden, C. of E., Bishop of the Yukon. To date no further word has been received on this subject.\n\nThe effect of the opening of this school is that several of the parents are not sending their children back to Carcross Residential School after the Christmas holidays. I have discussed education with the parents at every opportunity and I find them enthusiastic to have all their children attend school. The desirability of children attending a day school and living with their parents in preference to the institutional care of a residential school has been brought out many times in the minutes of the Joint Committee examining the Indian Act, at Ottawa.\n\nWill it be in order to submit the names of children not returning to Carcross Residential School, and attending Whitehorse Day School with a view of having them reinstated in Family Allowance pay? Rev. Lee has a fully qualified teacher, and using the curriculum of Alberta, which is required in the Yukon. The removal of a number of Whitehorse pupils from Carcross School should create openings for pupils from remote areas with no possibility of schooling facilities.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 929-1, part 1)\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, 23 January 1947.\n\nMR. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\n\nWe have your letters of Jan. 15th in connection with the school opened at Whitehorse by Rev. H.I. Lee. Our letter of Oct. 19, 1946 outlined the Departmental situation in the matter and advised you that before making any decision we wished to hear from Rt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, Anglican Bishop of the Yukon. We wrote Bishop Geddes in September but have not received any reply. We have recently been informed that he is in ill health and it is presumed that this explains his delay in replying to our communication.\n\nWe are again taking up the matter with the officer in charge of the Diocese of the Yukon office in Toronto and as soon as we have received a reply from him, we will write to you again. The re-instatement of certain children in family allowance pay will have to remain in abeyance until we make a final decision.\n\nIt is regretted that the management of the Carcross School disregarded official instructions issued many years ago to the effect that Christmas holidays should not be allowed. However, this does not excuse the Indian parents from not returning their children to the Carcross School on the completion of the Christmas Holidays.\n\nBernard F.

Geddes with reference to a school that is being operated at Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of the letter from our agent which we forwarded to Bishop Geddes at that time. We are extremely anxious to have the views of those in charge of the Church of England Diocese of the Yukon as Mr. Lee is continuing to operate the school and we should either recognize it or take steps to prevent him continuing.\n\nWe will appreciate any assistance that you can give us in this regard.

Since then we have also received further letters describing how the Reverend Lee has obtained a building and has the backing of the local Kiwanis Club and the Men's Council of Whitehorse in this concern.\n\nCould we please have information from you concerning this day school and a recommendation as to whether we should obtain an Order-in-Council authorizing it as an Indian day school within the meaning of the Indian Act.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E.

Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Supt., Indian Health Services,\nDept. National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Moore,\n\nDuring the past week, a new school has started in Whitehorse. It is in charge of the Rev. Lee, a returned evangelist.\n\nA qualified teacher is on her way in to Whitehorse, was delayed by storms. In the meantime Mr. Lee appears to be conducting a quiet, orderly school. He has bought and paid for a great number of books out of his own meagre stipend. Cocoa and sandwiches are served at recess and cod liver oil is given upon entrance each morning.\n\nHaving the school here is quite an asset as a place of contact for all families. I seized the opportunity to hold an immunization clinic in the school, the day after the opening. Twenty-six infants and pre-school children were given the first dose of combined diphtheria and pertussin. With the giving of the third dose, I will vaccinate them.\n\nWe are trying to combat an epidemic of scabies and imp\u00e9tigo at Burwash Landing. There are cases everywhere. Single handed it is impossible to do it efficiently. Then, too, the natives are on the move all the time, now. We are in dire need of a quantity of scabies lotion or some sulphur ointment.\n\nMight I suggest that all support be given to the new school in Whitehorse, as it will greatly assist the work in town. Hitherto, there has been no place to gather a group like this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMinnie Hackett, P.H.N.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\n6526, Sperling St.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n5th February 1947.\n\nMr. B.

I regret very much that I am unable to give you any definite information regarding this school. I left Whitehorse last August and have not been able to return there since, and I do not recall having met Mr. Lee at all.\n\nFrom your letter it would appear that the school would be of great advantage to the Indians, and certainly if the only cost to the Government would be the provision of school supplies and equipment, it would not be a great financial burden, and if as stated, no religious teaching is to be provided in the curriculum I do not see how anyone can have any objection to the school.\n\nI have written to Canon Chappell, our Clergyman at Whitehorse to see if he can give me any further information regarding Mr. Lee, and as soon as I hear from him I shall communicate with you further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon.\n\nWAG/AMV.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, February 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 15th ult., regarding the school at Whitehorse. We have finally received a letter from Rt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, Bishop of the Yukon.\n\nHe states that he has no particular information regarding the situation at Whitehorse as he left there last August. He has written to Cannon Chappell, the Anglican Clergyman at Whitehorse to obtain further information regarding Mr. Lee. The Department will await further word from Bishop Geddes before making a final decision but in the meantime, it would be advisable to have Mr. Lee complete one of our regular application forms so that we will know his qualifications. One of these forms is enclosed.\n\nIt is noted from your letter of January 15th, that Mr. Lee opened the school on January 13th, 1947. When replying, you might let me know the number of children at present enrolled and if they are attending regularly. We would also like to have an estimate of the cost of operating this school for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nBernard F.

Lee.\n\nRegarding last paragraph on your letter. The present enrollment of Indian children is 23, all of whom attend regularly.\n\nThe operating cost of this school has been estimated as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| light, flat rate      | $6.00 per month |\n| water                 | 3.00   |\n| Sewerage              | 3.00   |\n| one cord of wood      | 16.00  |\n| cocoa and biscuits    | 10.00  |\n| salary of teacher     | not known |\n\nThe school has already been equipped with blackboards, tables and benches, and a record kept of the cost of same.

Only one residential school is situated in this Agency, at Carcross. One Roman Catholic day school functions all winter, at Burwash Landing, while the Church of England have year round day schools at Moosehide and Fort Selkirk. Rev. H. Lee, a non-denominational protestant minister, requested permission to open a day school for Indians in Whitehorse and the matter was referred to Welfare and Training. It is strongly recommended that this school be given recognition.\n\nR.J. MEEK\nIndian Agent.\nThis has been discussed at length with the founder, Rev. H.S. Lee, a big, jovial man in the prime of life who was (and is) connected with the Aberhart Bible Institute in Alberta, Baptist background. He acquired considerable momentum doing welfare work for the armed forces. With his wife and two small children he came here to do missionary work, but when he saw the Indian children wandering the streets because they are deprived from territorial schools, he decided to add education to his repertoire.\n\nFor $400 he got the army hutment which is cut up into a decent class-room, a chapel, a kindergarten room, and living quarters for the five Lee's. His brother, a handyman, lives with them. Lee's zeal and magnetism get him a lot of free help in technical and mechanical work. His wife conducts the kindergarten (Army children) probably with considerable competence.\n\nRecently for $2,000 he acquired another large building (Plan herewith) which has five \"wings\", 20' by 120'. Included are a fancy cold storage plant, wash basins, toilet bowls, showers, single beds, mattresses, and sheets for fifty persons. He hopes to sell the building presently in use and apply the profit to remodeling the larger one.\nEventually the question of financing came out into the open. Mr. Lee wants to know how much help he can expect from the Dominion Government, \"help\" meaning money. I told him that would depend on many factors, reiterated and amplifying such points as:\n\n1. The Yukon is primarily \"American Territory\" and the future of Carcross school must be protected.\n\n2. Is Whitehorse a suitable concentration point?\n\n3. Is Lee's obvious affiliation financially sound?\n\n4. If Lee himself were a casualty, who would replace him?\n\n5. How long will the buildings last and how will they be maintained?\n\n6. Saskatchewan pays $60 a day (200 days) for pupils' board.\n\n7.

Lee will have to keep books and records in a manner approved by auditors.\n\nMr. Lee is a difficult man to discourage.

Extraordinary, there is no school tax!\nMeanwhile, would you please also mail Mr. Lee a copy of your school's brief and such circular letters as indicate our policy regarding maintenance of buildings, responsibilities of principals, etc., and a copy of the Indian Act.\n\nMost people in these parts take a \"broad-minded\" view concerning church and religion. They are used to non-sectarian schools. Mr. Lee's Christianity affects personal and social living rather than doctrinal matters, although I recall Albert as a \"hot Gospel\" enthusiast. Here the men support the Rotary Club, Masonry, and the Chamber of Commerce. These do not happen to be personal enthusiasms of my own, but I intend no modification of my oft-expressed wish that all men everywhere could be free.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\nARMY SIGNAL\n\nMAYO Y.T.

An itinerary was drawn up to make the best time at the disposal of Major Clark.\n\nThe Indian Day Schools at Whitehorse, Moosehide (Lawson) and Fort Selkirk were inspected by Major Clark. We also visited Indian Residential School at Carcross, the school and buildings were thoroughly examined by Major Clark.\n\nOn May 18th, accompanied by Bishop Coudert, and Mr. R. Forsild, contractor, a visit was made to the proposed site of the new Indian Residential School at Teslin. Various sites were examined and agreement was reached by all concerned on a particularly favorable spot close to the shore of Teslin Lake. We returned to Whitehorse on May 19th after a visit to the Indian Reserve at Teslin.\n\nTransportation was furnished by Departmental Carryall. Major Clark was not impressed by this vehicle which is designed for hard riding, and is not particularly comfortable. He suggested that the Carryall be kept for travel on the rougher roads of this Agency, and that the matter of obtaining a standard type sedan for use in Whitehorse and on the Alaska Highway be taken up with Headquarters.\n\nOn May 20th we flew to Mayo and went into all aspects of the establishment of a day school on the reserve there. A teacher has already been obtained and the matter is at present well in hand. On May 22nd we flew on to Dawson, and immediately went by boat to Moosehide Lay School. Various matters of Indian Administration were discussed with J.E. Gibben K.C., Controller of the Yukon. We returned to Whitehorse on May 24th, stopping en route at Fort Selkirk which gave Major Clark an opportunity of inspecting the day school there.\n\nAn official inspection of Whitehorse Lay School was made on May 26th. On May 29th we visited Carcross Indian Residential School, the pupils\nthere were given an examination by Major Clark, and a number of other matters of administration were taken up with Archdeacon H.G.M. Grant, principal of the school.\n\nMajor Clark left by Pan American plane on the morning of the 30th, flying to Juneau, Alaska, where he caught the south-bound C.F.R. boat to Vancouver.\n\nDuring the time Major Clark was in this Agency I was in his company the greater part of the time. Consequently the office routine got very much behind. I expect to be away from Whitehorse for quite a number of days this month on a tuberculosis survey with Dr. Roth, and in company with Col. E.L. Stone, M.D., during July. Major Clark suggested that the need for a clerk be again drawn to your attention. Apart from routine work of the Agency, there is the fact that Indians are obliged to walk the 5-mile round trip from downtown Whitehorse to this office, unless they are fortunate enough to own a car. It is disheartening to make the journey to this office only to find the Agent is away and there is no one to help him.\n\n(R.J.

These distances require a fast car or the agent's absences from his headquarters will be inconveniently protracted.\n\nThe carryall would, during its lifetime, operate in the Whitehorse area as a light truck and conveyance for personnel and materials not transportable by passenger car. The agent's office is two and a half miles uphill from the town. A taxi or light truck charges $1.50 for a one-way trip. The aged and indigent frequently have to be fetched and carried from the \"reserve\" to the agent's office, to the hospital, to the traders', together with parcels of food and clothing. This activity must go on when the agent is far away, and so a secondary vehicle must be available to the clerk in order to keep transportation costs as low as possible.\n\nMoreover, there will in bad weather and always on minor roads be road conditions which compel the agent to use the heavy-tired carryall even at a sacrifice of speed if he is really to cover his vast territory adequately, and sometimes there will be no road and the need for a \"cross-country\" vehicle will arise.\nWe shall soon have two residential schools in the territory. As we pay the initial and final transportation costs for pupils we should be able to cut those costs considerably if the agent is in a position to convey some pupils to and from their homes and still have a vehicle to handle local routine chores.\n\nThe carryall may give limited service for a year or two and is cheap at the price. Eventually it will have to be replaced by a utility vehicle of the post-war type.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Office,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nEXTRACT FROM QUARTERLY REPORT\nof\nMR. INDIAN AGENT MEEK\n\nDated July 10, 1947.\nOriginal filed on 75-166\n\nThe Whitehorse Indian School moved its location to a better site during this Quarter. The building, while not of prepossessing appearance, being formerly U.S. Army offices, fulfils its function very well indeed. The Rev. H. Lee purchased the building for school and residential purposes. The suggestion has been advanced that the Indian Affairs Branch secure the school building for the more efficient administration of the school.\n\nThere is a possibility that local conditions may make it desirable that a small number of children be boarded at the school while their parents are out on trap-lines. As only a few of the Whitehorse Indians are trappers, the total number of children thus cared for would be 10 or 12 at the most. Major Clark is in possession of these facts and has first-hand knowledge of local conditions in this regards.\n\n(sgd) R.J.

Lee, Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI attach hereto original and copy of a letter received by me today from the Rev. H.I. Lee, requesting that consideration be given his application to accept Indian children as boarders at his day school.\n\nOn August 16th I personally examined the school facilities and material as set forth in Rev. Lee's letter. Day school facilities remain as before, over 20 children are expected to attend when school opens next month. Almost all of the parents applying for the admission of their children to Whitehorse School are from Champagne. This is one of the largest centers of Indian population in the Yukon, and up to the present has been served by a summer school operated by the Church of England. The school did not function this past summer.\n\nMajor C.A.F. Clark has examined the new school buildings of Rev. Lee, and I believe has a plan of the structure. It is possible that so many children will be attending Whitehorse Indian School this coming term, that the employment of another teacher will be warranted.\n\nI might say that the operation, so far, of the Whitehorse Indian Day School has been an unqualified success.\n\n(R.J.

Lee, requesting the Department to approve his accepting Indian children as boarders at the Whitehorse school.\n\nWe have carefully considered the proposals made by Mr. Lee and at the present time we are not prepared to make a definite decision.

Lee, the director of the Indian Lay School at Whitehorse. I have visited the school several times, and each time there seemed to be an increasing enrollment. I am inclined to believe the peak has now been reached.\n\nMiss Loan, the present teacher, has coped with the situation in a very able manner. At the present time the primary children attend school in the mornings, and from Grade two to five in the afternoon. The proposed school room for an extra class has been examined. It is adjacent to the present class room and is well suited for the need. I have advised Miss Loan to submit a further requisition for school books and material.\n\nMiss M. Mallinger, nominated by Rev. Lee as a teacher, is at present teaching in the city of Calgary. I am given to understand she holds a first class teaching certificate in the Province of Alberta. She has had in the neighborhood of seven or eight years teaching experience. She recently telegraphed Rev. Lee her willingness to accept a teaching position here. Accommodation is being provided for her in the event of appointment.\n\nI might state that the sixty pupils mentioned are not all local Indian children. Quite a number come from Champagne, about 80 miles away, and which has only been provided with the most meagre educational facilities for a number of years past. All children from outside Whitehorse are being cared for by Rev. Lee.\n\nI would strongly recommend the appointment of another teacher at the Whitehorse Indian School.\n\n(R.J.

I particularly wanted you to see the changed conditions at Rev. Lee's school. He now has about 60 pupils, some of them are half-breeds, several are children of Indians on the enfranchised list who don't attend the white school here. I think we should bring this to the attention of the Territorial Government. Lee is caring for in the neighborhood of 40 kids from out of town, and it is costing him a great deal. I have examined the dormitories, kitchens, playrooms, etc., and it certainly shows up in startling contrast to Carcross School.\n\nAs you know the Whitehorse School has not been established as a residential school as yet, but Lee figures he can run several more weeks without going broke. I wonder if you can convey the urgency of the situation to the proper officials. Carcross School is filled, and with a new principal I understand they are mucking out and making a lot of long overdue improvements. I haven't met the teacher yet, as I am tied down much too much at Whitehorse. We have arranged for power from the Army, and also water and sewerage. Supply of fuel is another point which has increased since last term, as there are dormitories and kitchens to heat. We are expecting another teacher in soon, all of Grade 1 in the larger classroom taught by Miss Doan, and Grade 2 to 6 in the smaller room.\n\nMiss Dougall is getting along well at Mayo, she likes the work too, I am hoping she will be appointed a Welfare Worker. Her last letter states she hadn't received many supplies as yet, but that is due entirely to the Stewart River being so low the boats couldn't get up. Part of her difficulty is that many of the kids can't speak English. She says she gets unlimited assistance from Rev. Wareham. They had their first fall of snow on the 20th of last month.\n\nWhen you were here you promised to do something about occupational therapy for the patients of the Indian Ward at Whitehorse Hospital.

Water supply and sewage disposal appear to be satisfactory. The fire hazard is not great, and the town and Army both maintain good fire departments. Indian Health Services headquarters (a few blocks away) has two doctors, a hospital staff and two public health nurses available.\n\nWe may have some justification for expecting the territory to defray the cost of teaching and maintaining children of Indian blood whose attendance at white schools is discouraged.\n\nThe situation in part resembles one arising out of the energetic action of Bishop Cordert who has built a semi-residential school for white children of his faith and now expects territorial recognition and aid.\n\nC.A.V.Clark\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 929-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 9, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nPlease note memorandum of Major Clark dated the 9th October and also letter of October 4 which he received from a friend of his.

Lee.\n\nReference your letters of August 18th and October 8th, concerning the operation of a Residential School at Whitehorse.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with the Director and with the Deputy Minister and I have been directed to inform you that we can take no action towards recognizing this as an Indian Residential School at the present time. It has been decided to postpone any such action for at least a year.\n\nWith reference to the request for wood for this school, it is felt that the Department should not be asked to pay more than its share. We are already providing for the salaries of two teachers at this school and for a large quantity of school supplies. We understand that these teachers are teaching half-breeds and whites as well as Indians. We have enough difficulty providing funds for our Indian schools alone without providing for the education of half-breeds and whites. I hope you will appreciate the fact that it is not because we do not want to help Mr. Lee but because we have many pressing demands on the moneys that are provided us each year. We have opened several new schools already this year and several more are under construction. Each new school is another source of drain upon our estimates.\nTherefore, it is suggested that you review the wood situation with Mr. Lee with the possibility of having his request for $90.00 per month for wood reduced somewhat. It is also suggested that you let us know the number of Indian children, the number of half-breeds and the number of white children who are now enrolled at this school:\n\n(a) As boarders\n\n(b) As Day School Pupils.\n\nThis will enable us to present a more accurate picture of its operation, if required.\n\nBernard F.

I would like to point out that #20 (a), of No. 2, Vol. 1, Indian School Bulletin, states that school teachers are classed as temporary civil servants. It appears that all Federal Government employees, excepting those hired on a day to day basis, are in receipt of a Northern Living Allowance in the Yukon. This applies to the teachers in white schools, employees of the Yukon Territorial Government, which is administered by the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nUpon making enquiries regarding Northern Living allowance, it appears there are no exceptions that I have been able to discover, excepting our own Indian School teachers. The Canadian Army and R.C.A.F. receive Northern Living Allowance throughout the Yukon. Most of the teachers of white schools in the Yukon receive a salary of $3000.00 per annum. These teachers do not all have the qualifications that some of our Indian School teachers have. Due to extremely high freight rates into the Yukon Northern Living Allowances are the custom in the Federal Government and in private enterprise.\n\nMay the matter of N.L.A. for teachers of Indian Schools in the Yukon receive your earliest attention please?\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhitehorse Indian School\n\nI was requested to attend a conference concerning the above school in company with Rev. H.I. Lee, director of school, Gordon Lee, a Councillor of the Yukon Territorial Government, and R. Hulland, Superintendent of Schools for the Yukon. The particular matter under discussion was the attendance of half-breeds and borderline Indians at Rev. Lee's school, which is at present an authorized Indian Day School.\n\nThere are several children attending the Indian school who are half-breeds and whose parents are living the life of an Indian. And also some borderline cases, of which no one seems certain of the status of the children. There are about a dozen of these children attending the Indian School. It is possible that some of these would have the right to attend the local white school, but it is not denied that these children are not welcome there. They appear to be perfectly content with the other children of a similar economic status at Rev. Lee's school.\n\nSuperintendent Hulland inspected the Indian School and expressed himself very strongly in favor of the establishment. He further promised to take up the matter of subsidizing Rev. Lee for the half-breed children at the school, by the Territorial Government. Councillor Gordon Lee informed me that he would ask for a grant for twelve children which he conceded the responsibility of the Territory. It may be pointed out that most of the children in question are also boarding at the Whitehorse Indian School.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from R. Hulland stating he had taken up this matter with Mr. J.E. Gibben, Controller of the Yukon, stressing the urgency of immediate action, but so far nothing definite has materialized. I wish to point out that this is almost the end of the second month in which Rev. Lee has maintained some 40 children attending the school at his own expense. I respectfully request that action be taken in this matter as soon as possible.\n\n(R.J. Meek) Indian Agent.\nOttawa, October 30, 1947.\n\nNorthern Living Allowance\nfor Indian Day School Teachers\n\nReference yours of October 19 -\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon receipt of your letter I have drafted a letter for Mr. Hoey to Mr. Gibson, Director of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, requesting further details of the northern living allowance as paid to teachers of territorial schools in the Yukon.\n\nIt may interest you to know that we have already been working for some time upon a scale of allowances for our teachers in the Northwest Territories and in other northern parts of Canada. We hope to be able to give you further information regarding this at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R. J.

T. I feel that before making application for a northern living allowance for these teachers I should have further information concerning the allowances paid to the teachers of territorial schools.\n\nHave you one of your officials sufficiently acquainted with the details of these allowances to discuss the matter with our Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nR.

Gibson, Esq.,\nNorthwest Territories & Yukon Affairs,\nNorlite Building,\nWellington Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nWhitehorse Indian School,\nBox 527,\nWhitehorse,Yukon,TY.,\nOctober 29,1947.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nI have before me a copy of the letter written to Mr. Meek, by Mr Neary, on behalf of the Deputy Minister, to advise me that no action can be taken this year in regard to our Residential School, to recognize it as such.\n\nThe situation that presents itself at the moment is a serious one, and is a matter of great urgency, therefore I am writing to you that somehow this matter may once again be reviewed.\n\nNo doubt you already know that we have forty resident children at the school, feeding, clothing, and taking care of them is a matter which I can no longer handle from the financial side.\n\nWe have put everything of our personal earnings and gifts into this school endeavoring to bring to these sadly neglected children an education which they have been deprived of for years. We have spent months in preparation of the building, and a terrific amount of money to get this school equipped for the children to be able stay here. Therefore it seems incredible that they should be compelled to return to the bush, to their filthy tents and unlivable cabins, after we have had gone to the extent of delousing and cleaning them up, healing their sores and what not. And yet that is what will happen if we do not get assistance at once.\n\nI do not know what steps you can take in this regard but I certainly hope that something can be done by your Dept. to see us through. I am aware too of the many pressing demands that are made upon your dept., yet I firmly believe that this work warrants the Govt.'s attention as these children have no other means whatsoever of receiving an education.\n\nTrusting that you will bring this matter before the Deputy Minister for his careful reconsideration and see if surely something cannot be done.\n\nWill appreciate an early reply as I am in a sort of dilemma.\n\nYours Very Truly\n\nNOV 5 1947\n\nN.T.

Most of the money donated ($100.00) is being used for the upkeep of the children boarding at the school, for which no funds are available. The Territorial Government through Mr. J.E. Gibben, K.C., Controller of the Yukon Territory, were approached for an appropriation for the upkeep of some 12 or 13 half-breed children from out of town, and for which no school facilities exist. This request was not granted.\n\nI am informed that this donation was entirely unsolicited by Rev. H.I. Lee, director of the Whitehorse Indian School. I might state that the school is conducted on non-sectarian lines, the teachers are duly qualified with considerable experience. Enrollment is over 60. The teachers are not missionaries and there is a minimum of religious education. It would appear that Rev. Lee's splendid efforts to assist the Indians of Whitehorse and vicinity holds the approval of the greater proportion of the white residents of Whitehorse.\n\nThe staff of the Whitehorse Inn and Cafe take this opportunity of expressing their sincerest appreciation for the splendid support given to their bazaar and tea held in the Blue Owl Cafe on Monday and their best thanks to all who attended the same. The sum of $100 which was raised is being donated to Rev. Harold Lee for the benefit of the local Indian School.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent\nDuring a recent visit to the Whitehorse Indian Day School, Rev. H.I. Lee, director of this school requested some definite commitment from the Indian Affairs Branch regarding maintenance of the school for the ensuing fiscal year, particularly with regard to boarders.\n\nThere is at present an enrollment of about 60, with over 40 children being maintained at the school while their parents are on trap-lines and wood-camps. Most of the boarders are from Champagne some 60 miles west of Whitehorse, which does not have a school. It was while conducting a volunteer summer school at the salmon fishing station of the Champagne Indians, that Rev. Lee was approached by several Indian parents and asked if he would take care of their children at his Whitehorse school during the winter.\n\nThis modest petition was granted, but far more children than had been anticipated arrived at the school, until the original dozen or so became 40 or 50. The large building owned by Rev. Lee was turned into dormitories, classrooms, kitchen and mess-hall. The feeding of the children constituted a tremendous problem, as very few of the parents seem to realize their own responsibility in the matter. The situation has been somewhat eased by the white citizens of Whitehorse, who, realizing the altruistic efforts of Rev. Lee have held bazaars, sales, etc., and in many charitable ways, endeavored to assist the Indian school.\n\nThe two teachers are the only paid personnel at the school. These teachers receive extremely modest salaries for the Yukon, as they are not in receipt of Northern Living Allowance, though I believe the matter is under consideration. Besides the two paid teachers, there are the following unpaid workers: Rev. H.I. Lee, director; Mr. Deforest Lee, mechanical work; Mrs. D. Lee, cook; Mr. Rimling, boys supervisor; Mrs. Rimling, girls supervisor; Mrs. Maggie Chitze (Indian), laundress. The school cannot be considered a religious institution, but is interdenominational.\nRev. Lee understands and appreciates the position the Branch is in when he took in boarders without first making financial arrangements with the Department. Despite this, and the many other difficulties presented, the school is an unqualified success, and compares favorably with any white school in the Yukon.\n\nMay the Rev. H.I. Lee be advised of any arrangements between Indian Affairs Branch and himself for the continuance of his boarding school with the assistance of the Department.\n\nN.J. Meek\n\n(R.

Past experience has proven that great care must be taken before recognizing the smaller denominations and entering into contracts with them for the operation of residential schools.\n\nWe are building a residential school at Teslin with a pupilage of 120. It is our intention to purchase from the Church of England their residential school at Carcross. When this has been done it is our intention to improve this school and to increase its pupilage. With these two residential schools and our day schools, we had hoped to provide sufficient educational facilities for the Indian children of the Yukon.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have your comments concerning these points. We would also like to be advised as to\n\n(a) whether the Territorial Government is paying a per capita grant for the non-Indians,\n\n(b) Whether there is any denomination behind the Reverend Mr. Lee.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. R.

Dunbrack, Fire Chief of the town of Whitehorse to inspect the building from a fire prevention point of view.\n\nI am in receipt of a recommendation from Fire Chief Dunbrack, and his original letter is attached hereto for your information. Present fire fighting equipment is quite inadequate, and has been provided at Rev. Lee's own expense. It might be considered that the dormitories of which there are four hardly come within the scope of an Indian Day School. However, the fact remains that the children are sleeping there, and no doubt a certain moral responsibility rests on the Branch.\n\nDuring the depths of winter Mr. Lee had a system of firewatching in which there were always two people on duty, day and night, to keep fires going, and for fire prevention purposes. Fire drill in both classrooms is now held once or twice a week. A fire siren was given to the school by Fire Chief Dunbrack.\n\n(R.J.

H.I. Lee, Whitehorse. On June 25th, the end of the school term, there were 67 children enrolled, or whom 65 are returning next term. Mr. Lee already has several applications from out-of-town parents to send their children into Whitehorse to the school. If the enrollment is as anticipated, it is possible that a third teacher for this school will be required.\n\nRev. Lee conducted the school on a Boarding School basis during the past school year, largely assisted by contributions from local white people. He is not able to carry on financially for another term, and today again requested that the Department take over the school as a Government Institution. A per capita grant is not sought, but the bare running expenses of the school. At the present time the two teachers, Miss E. Dean and Miss M. Mallinger are the only employees of the Branch. Besides the teachers, the personnel required to properly run the school are: a cook (preferably male), a matron, a laundress, and a director or supervisor.\n\nPresent costs are approximately $800.00 per month for food, and about $100.00 per month for fuel.\n\nMost of the children are from points outside Whitehorse, and for whom there is normally no living accommodation, even if they could attend the local white school.\n\nMajor R.F. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools, Vancouver, paid a courtesy visit recently to the Whitehorse Indian School, and possibly his more experienced opinion would be of value in deciding the future operations of the school. The remarkable success of this school during the past year would lead one to consider favorably a continuation of its' existence as a semi-residential school under Departmental auspices.\n\nN.J. Meek\n(R.J. Meek) Indian agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference your file 166-8-1 re Whitehorse Indian Day School. I beg to advise that the Yukon Territorial Council at their last session in Dawson voted an appropriation to pay for the upkeep of half-breed children and orphans of white or doubtful status, being maintained by the Rev.

J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence with regard to the recognition of the residential school being conducted by the Reverend Mr. Lee at Whitehorse, Y. T.\n\nPlease find attached a draft series of terms which we have drawn up for discussion by you with Mr. Lee.\n\nI note from your letter of August 11 that the Yukon Territorial Council is paying $1.10 per day per child for the upkeep of half-breed children and orphans of white or doubtful status being maintained by the Reverend Mr. Lee and attending the Whitehorse Indian Day School.\n\nYou will note that in the attached terms, the Department is prepared to offer Mr. Lee 95\u00a2 a day for the children whom he is maintaining at his institution. Last year our Department paid the two teachers at the school and also paid a Northern Living Allowance. We also pay for the fuel, school supplies, janitor service, etc. We have prepared an itemized account showing our expenditures at this school. By dividing this by our proportionate share of the number of children enrolled at the school, we feel that it is fair to assume that this Department is presently paying a per diem allowance of 15\u00a2. The amount of 95\u00a2 represents the difference between this and the per diem allowance allowed by the Yukon Territorial Council.\n\nI would also advise that we will reduce the monthly amount paid for noonday lunches from $75.00 per month to $25.00 per month for obvious reasons.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nPROPOSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES and THE REVEREND H.I. LEE OF WHITEHORSE\n\n1. That this Department will not recognize Mr. Lee's institution as an Indian residential school and will in no way be responsible for any debts or obligations incurred by his instruction.\n\n2. That we are prepared to continue to pay the following:\n\n(a) The salaries and Northern Living Allowances for the two teachers employed at the Whitehorse Indian Day School;\n\n(b) The school books and other materials used by the Indian children attending this school;\n\n(c) An amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month for 1 November to 30 April for the provision of noon-day lunch for the Indian day school children attending this school.\n\n3. Effective from 1 September, 1948, the Department will pay a per diem rate of ninety-five cents (.95\u00a2) for the maintenance in the home conducted by Reverend Mr. Lee, for each Indian child who is admitted thereto as a boarder, provided that no payment would be made unless the Department's approval had been obtained for the admission of the child before the child entered the school. The payment at the rate stated would be made monthly on receipt of a statement signed jointly by Mr. Lee and yourself. Forms for this purpose would be prepared here and sent to you.\n\n4. That in the event of a change in the management of this school, this contract will be null and void and subject to renegotiation if necessary.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\n\nReference Whitehorse Indian Day School. I attach hereto Form 325, Application for Employment in Indian Day Schools, in the name of Mrs. Sophia Weigand, nee Derko.\n\nWhen Miss M. Doan was unable to return to Whitehorse for the opening of school, Mrs. Weigand offered her services. She commenced duties at Whitehorse Day School on September 15th. Apparently Mrs. Weigand enjoys teaching Indian children and wishes to complete the full academic year.\n\nMrs. Weigand has a home in Whitehorse and would qualify for Northern Living Allowance.

Please note the several proposals Rev. Lee has made. There are now 70 children enrolled, a few more pupils would warrant another teacher. I have inspected the accommodation offered by Rev. Lee, he appears to have ample room for additional pupils. Regarding proposal 3, fire extinguishers have been recommended by Fire Chief Dunbrack; school is inspected by Chief Dunbrack at least once a month, and fire drill held approximately once a week.\n\nProposal 4, school buildings are of wood construction, hire of nightwatchman during winter months as a precautionary measure is recommended.\n\nList of pupils attending school, with family Allowance number if required, will be submitted on receipt of forms mentioned in proposal No. 3, of your Proposed Agreement.\n\n[Signature]\nR.J.

Lee on giving two months' notice.\nOttawa, November 6, 1948.\n\nThe Acting Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nYesterday when Mr. C.J. Rogers of the White Pass and Yukon Route was in the office he submitted a proposition that the Reverend Mr. Lee who is running a welfare institution and school at Whitehorse should remove from his present location on the White Pass land south of Whitehorse to an area on the other side of the tracks on the river bank and not far from the hospital. The situation is illustrated on the attached map.\n\nAt the time we took it for granted that as Mr. Lee was taking care of some Indian children he was probably occupying some building that had been assigned to your branch. However, you tell me this morning that while you are contemplating entering into an agreement with Mr. Lee he must have made his own arrangements about a building because he is not in space assigned to you.\n\nWe lack information about the property which Mr. Lee now occupies and the property which Mr. Rogers is prepared to turn over. However, Lee's present site is on land that we have rented from the White Pass people for the use of the Army and it is probable that Mr. Lee has the use of some Army buildings. As for the land that Mr. Rogers is prepared to give us, we are under the impression that there are a great many squatters on it and that we would have the problem of dealing with the squatters. The land is unsurveyed and until a surveyor has investigated it is difficult to say what property could be made available for a site for Mr. Lee's institution. There is also the question of how high the water backs up in this area and how often.\nI am advising you of the discussion so that you may know just what is going on. We would appreciate it if you would let us have an outline of the type of agreement you propose to enter into with Mr. Lee for I suppose he will be asking the Commissioner at Dawson to make some sort of an arrangement about indigent children who are not Indians.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 22, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 6th with reference to Reverend Mr. Lee who is operating a welfare institution and school at Whitehorse.\n\nNo buildings were assigned to Mr. Lee by this Branch. He started the school himself and we have no information on file indicating the manner in which he obtained the buildings which he is using.\n\nHowever, we have several Indian children in the Yukon who require institutional care. We have been considering entering into an agreement with Reverend Mr. Lee regarding the maintenance and education of any Indian children whom we decide to place in his institution.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood that we are not recognizing Mr. Lee's school as an Indian residential school. For your information I may add that we have Indian children at many other institutions throughout Canada without recognizing these institutions as part of our regular residential school system.\nWith reference to the agreement to which I refer in this memorandum, we have not finally settled the terms with Mr. Lee but for your information I enclose a copy of the proposed agreement.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, December 1st, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nWhitehorse School.\n\nOn November 22nd we sent you a memorandum with regard to the Reverend Mr. Lee who is operating a welfare institution and school at Whitehorse.\n\nWould you please let us know whether you concur in the proposed terms of our agreement with Mr. Lee. We have not stated a daily fee of ninety-five cents in comparison with the fee paid for destitute non-Indian children by the Yukon Territorial Council. It must be realized that we are paying the salaries and a Northern Living Allowance to the teachers at this school already. We are also providing books and an amount of $25.00 per month for the provision of noon-day lunch during the winter.\n\nActing Director.\n\nBFN/HH.\nPROPOSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nOF THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n-AND-\nTHE REVEREND H.I.

I wrote you on October 21 advising that Rev. Lee had accepted your proposals.\n\nIn Part 3 of Agreement Between Indian Affairs Branch and the Rev. H.I. Lee of Whitehorse, it is stated that .95\u00a2 per day would be paid Rev. Lee for each Indian child admitted there as a boarder, and forms for the purpose would be sent to this office. To date we have not received these forms and I have advised Rev. Lee to submit an attendance record of Indian pupils boarding at the Whitehorse School, for the months of September, October and November, 1948. This statement, signed by the Rev. Lee and myself in accordance with your instructions, is attached hereto in duplicate.\n\nThe Yukon Territorial Government has been fulfilling their agreed payment for halfbreed children each month, and the Rev. Lee has requested that payments by the Indian Affairs Branch receive your earliest consideration.\n\nReference Eddie and Rose Boss, entered Sept. 15th, discharged Nov. 11th. These children were admitted to Carcross Residential School, their mother is a patient in the T-B ward of the Whitehorse General Hospital; the two children entered the Whitehorse Indian Day School in order that they may see their mother from time to time. They were taken to Carcross School by me on November 12th. If the mother is discharged, and wishes to live in Whitehorse, an application for discharge from Carcross School will be made.\n\n(R.J.

Meek]\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhitehorse Indian Day School\n\nIt is reported by Rev. H.I. Lee, Director of the above school, that the two teachers found difficulty in properly carrying out their work due to the large numbers in each classroom. As the services of Miss Ethel Doan, formerly teacher at the school, were available, the children were divided into three classes as follows:\n\nGrade I Mrs. Weigand 35 pupils\nGrade II Miss Doan 27 pupils\nGrade III and on Miss Mallinger 22 pupils\n\nIt is requested that Miss Doan be accepted as a third teacher at the above school. She started on March 7th. Completed questionnaire forms and other data are in the hands of the Department pertaining to Miss Ethel Doan. Her qualifications remain the same as when questionnaire first submitted.\n\nIn view of the fact that the enrollment is 84 and that Miss Doan did extremely good service when the school was first organized, I would recommend that she be taken on strength as from the 7th instant.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\n1. On the morning of January 26th, 1949 a patrol was made by the writer accompanied by Cst. Jones J.P. to a shack in the Dowell Area of Whitehorse, Y.T., where the exceptionally noted subject was living with her mother. When questioned as to why the girl was not at school it was stated that she was needed at home to look after a three year old child. When asked why the mother didn't look after the young child the mother said that she had to go hunting tree squirrels. During the course of the interview it was learned that the child's father was working at March Lake and drawing wages enough to do the family without the mother hunting. Mrs. JACKSON was told to have the girl at school the next day.\n\n2. Two patrols have been made to the Indian Mission School and it has been found that since the girl received the warning she has been boarding at the school and that her mother has returned to March Lake, Y.T.\n\n3.

This man has, in a very short time, built up an excellent reputation for his school and for his own very excellent relationship with the Native Indians.\n\nThe children who are cared for in his school are looked after extremely well and from the health standpoint are also carefully watched. Mr. Lee has been most co-operative with Mr. Neek and Miss Larkin and on many occasions when the local hospital has lacked beds, he has taken in Indian children and looked after them until a hospital bed in Whitehorse was free. I thought I would mention these things about Mr. Lee as I feel he deserves every consideration and help from our Department. I would recommend that a supply of necessary drugs be furnished to him for use in his school, along the same lines as is presently supplied to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) H.

Mr. Lee's helpfulness to the Whitehorse Hospital.\n\nThe report further suggests, and the suggestion is supported by the Assistant Director of Indian Health Services, that a requisition be forwarded to Indian Health Services for such drugs and related medical necessities as you and the Rev.

Yesterday, October 18th, I was asked to sit in on negotiations between Rev. H.I. Lee, director of the Whitehorse Indian School, and Mr. C.J. Rogers, president of the White Pass and Yukon Railroad Co., concerning buildings and land on which the Indian School is situated.\n\nThe property concerned measures some 120 feet by 200 feet, and is owned by the White Pass Rwy., and which was leased to the Department of Mines and Resources some five years ago \"for the purpose of constructing the Northwest Highway\". The U.S. Army built a large office on this site, which has since been acquired by Rev. Lee. Department of Mines and Resources still hold the lease for the ground, but Mr. Rogers expects this will be given up in the future.\n\nWhen the Department relinquish their lease on this land (apparently on word from the Canadian Army), Mr. Gordon is willing to lease the said land to Rev. Lee at a rental of $250 per annum for a period of five years, with the understanding that at the end of that time if either party wish to withdraw, then the present building must be dismantled and moved away. This is in accord with the policy of the War Assets Corporation.\n\nMr. Rogers wants to know if the Indian Affairs Branch are concerned with this lease. Is more ground needed? If so, he is willing to make arrangements for this. The land is not included in the taxation area of Whitehorse, but all indications point to it being included in the not too far distant future. Mr. Rogers would like to be guided by the policy of the I.A. Branch with regard to schools - whether day or residential. Would it be possible for Mr. C.A.F. Clark, if he should be in this area, to represent the Branch in discussions on the matter with Mr. Rogers and Rev. Lee.\n\n(R.J.

His letter reads as follows:\n\n\"Reference to a/m subject. Yesterday, October 18th, I was asked to sit in on negotiations between Rev. H.I.

Meek, Indian Agent, Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nResidential School Operated at Whitehorse, Yukon by Reverend H.L. Lee.\n\nReference your letters of August 18th and October 8th, concerning the operation of a Residential School at Whitehorse.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with the Director and with the Deputy Minister and I have been directed to inform you that we can take no action towards recognizing this as an Indian Residential School at the present time. It has been decided to postpone any such action for at least a year.\n\nWith reference to the request for wood for this school, it is felt that the Department should not be asked to pay more than its share. We are already providing for the salaries of two teachers at this school and for a large quantity of school supplies. We understand that these teachers are teaching half-breeds and whites as well as Indians. We have enough difficulty providing funds for our Indian schools alone without providing for the education of half-breeds and whites. I hope you will appreciate the fact that it is not because we do not want to help Mr. Lee but because we have many pressing demands on the moneys that are provided us each year. We have opened several new schools already this year and several more are under construction. Each new school is another source of drain upon our estimates.\nTherefore, it is suggested that you review the wood situation with Mr. Lee with the possibility of having his request for $90.00 per month for wood reduced somewhat. It is also suggested that you let us know the number of Indian children, the number of half-breeds and the number of white children who are now enrolled at this school:\n\n(a) As boarders\n\n(b) As Day School Pupils.\n\nThis will enable us to present a more accurate picture of its operation, if required.\n\nBernard F.

The land is actually owned by British Yukon Railway Company.\n\nOn November 17, 1947, we made representations to the Department of National Defence regarding your school and under date of the 2nd instant a reply has been received as follows:\n\n\"Although there is a continuing Army Requirement for the lease in question, it will be quite in order for the Indian Affairs Branch of your Department to occupy an area of one acre of land surrounding the building now in use, as requested in the aforementioned letter.\"\n\nPossibly\nPossibly the above arrangement will be satisfactory to you in the meantime but, of course, in the event of the lease being terminated you would require to negotiate with the British Yukon Railway Company if you consider it advisable to make a purchase.\n\nR.

O. BOX 217\nWHITEHORSE--YUKON--CANADA\nFebruary 14th, 1950.\n\nMr. J.A. Simmons,\nM.P. for the Yukon,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons:\n\nPersonal Greetings!\n\nI am taking this opportunity to write you and place before you a request which I trust you will in turn present to the proper authorities there.\n\nYou are more familiar with our School here than perhaps anyone else in the community, you know the efforts that I have put forth to get this work established so that the Indian might have a place to attend school here in the Yukon which they didn't have prior to our opening up of this much needed work. I feel that you are the only one who I can ask to present to Ottawa the urgent need of a proper Boarding School. We have invested everything that we owned to establish this work and we want to see it go ahead and not back. The time has come where we will have to make major repairs to this place if it is to be used much longer for this purpose. Therefore it would seem unwise to invest much more in the present set up due to the serious fire hazard that presents itself in the nature of this particular arrangement.\n\nI believe too that you are acquainted with the fact that we do not own the ground upon which our present School is located, this presents the problem of knowing what to do in regards to any permanent construction or work being done on our present buildings. I am quite prepared to have the school out of town a few miles if we will be able to get a new school under construction very soon. We are anxious about this matter and feel that something should be done as quickly as possible in this regard.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6477, file 929-5, part 3)\nI have confidence Mr. Simmons that you can present this urgent need without any favouritism whatsoever but from strictly an essential need and I do believe that you have shown satisfactory evidence that we mean business in this thing and are not just fooling around with any pretence. We have invested as I mentioned before Thousands of dollars in this work and are determined to see this thing go forward for the betterment of the Indians in and around this locality, and elsewhere where we find it possible to help the Indians.\n\nThanking you very kindly for your co-operation in this very urgent appeal.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\n(sgd) Harold Lee\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhitehorse Day School\n\nI have been asked by Miss Lilias Farley, Arts Teacher at the above school, for an art classroom. At the present time Miss Farley makes use of the rooms of the teachers whose class she is instructing - not a very satisfactory arrangement.\n\nA room is available at the above school some 40 feet by 20 feet. It is fairly well lighted, one exit leading outside and one exit leading onto a corridor in the school. Heating is by wood stove and is sufficient for the room. By the addition of cupboards, two additional windows, and painting, it would be a very suitable room for art instruction, as well as whatever handicraft may be promoted from time to time at the school.\n\nI have received an estimate that 11 sheets of 5-ply, costing $8.25 each, two windows costing approximately $6.00 each, and hinges, catches, etc., would be the materials required. Labour would be approximately $100.00. The room should be painted, and, if desired, paint could be requisitioned in accordance with your circular \"Repairs and Maintenance to Indian Day Schools\" dated February 13th, 1950.\n\nMay I be advised as to your wishes re the above.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\nMarch 13th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nRe: Whitehorse School\n\nWe have your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to teaching art at the above school. We approve local purchase of 11 sheets of 5-ply, costing $8.25 each, two windows costing approximately $6.00 each, and hinges, catches, etc. It is also noted that the labour will cost approximately $100.00.\n\nIf needed, you may also expend an amount of approximately $35.00 for paint.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nWHITEHORSE INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nI have noted the contents of Mr. Lee's letter of February 14, to Mr. J. A. Simmons, M.P.\n\nAs you are aware, this is not an Indian residential school but a private school at which Indian pupils are boarded while their parents are on trap line. We pay an amount towards the maintenance of each child and we also operate, in conjunction with this establishment, a day school at which both the boarding and the day pupils are given classroom education.\n\nI feel that great care must be exercised in dealing with Mr. Lee as he seems to have no church body backing his efforts. Another disturbing feature is the possibility that the Anglican school at Carcross may have to be moved. Canon Cook is not in favour of Mr. Simmons' suggestion that it be moved either to Carmacks or to Selkirk. He would prefer to have it established in the vicinity of Whitehorse. If so, we would be faced with requests for the building of two residential schools near Whitehorse,-\n\n(a) Mr. Lee\n(b) the Anglican school transferred from Carcross.\n\nWe have worked for many years with the four well established churches in the operation of these residential schools and our officials feel that we should not undertake to engage in a contract with a fifth church.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe Director,\nIndian Health Services,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nStr:\n\nAt Whitehorse I visited the school operated by Rev. Mr. Lee. He has built up this school over about three years past and now has 75 Indian and some 15 other pupils in residence. I was told that he or his sponsors founded the school at their expense and carried it on for a year or more without the financial co-operation which they now enjoy from the Department.\n\nThe buildings are converted army huts and do not look to be in very good repair. The fire hazard is extremely high, but as the buildings are all one story and have plenty of doors the residents would all probably be able to escape.\n\nThe premises were as clean and well-kept as could be expected in such buildings. The children were clean, looked well nourished, orderly and cheerful.\n\nMr. Lee is concerned about the future of the school. The buildings in use will not last long and will become an increasing problem in themselves over the very near future. If for any reason the premises had to be abandoned, 75 Indian children would have no school. There must be about 300 Indians of school age in the Yukon. I know of 5 schools other than this one, and would suppose their total capacity to be about 175. Some few are also in public schools at Dawson and Whitehorse, not many.\n\nIt is perhaps not my place to go into detail about education at large, but I appreciate the care, feeding, teaching and health supervision of these 75 children at Mr. Lee's school.\n\nE.L. Stone,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services.\n\nCOPY TO: Superintendent, Yukon Indian Agency\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nWHITEHORSE INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nMarch 14, 1950.\n\nAs requested by you, I have prepared the following statement which might assist Mr. J.A. Simmons, M.P., in replying to the Reverend H.A. Lee's letter of February 14:\n\n(1) We are now operating Indian Residential Schools in conjunction with four religious denominations. They assume considerable responsibility in the management of these schools and are responsible organizations who assume considerable financial burden in the conduct of these schools. Mr. Lee does not have such financial backing.\n\n(2) The Department does not recognize Mr. Lee's school as an Indian Residential School but only as a private school at which Indian pupils are boarded while their parents are on the trap-line. There are of course a number of non-Indian children at the school towards whose maintenance the Yukon Territorial Council makes a contribution.\n\n(3) The Anglican Residential School will be forced in the near future to move from Carcross. The new school will probably be required within a radius of 100 miles of Whitehorse. If so, we would be faced with requests for the building of two Indian Residential Schools for Protestant children in or near Whitehorse.\n\n(4) We have worked for many years with the four well established Churches in the operation of these residential schools and we do not feel that any benefit would result in the association with another religious group. From the educational point of view it would be most desirable to build...\na larger residential school rather than two smaller units.\n\nWe appreciate the good work that has been accomplished at the Whitehorse School under the direction of Mr. Lee. He has carried on under difficult circumstances and much credit is due him for the success of this institution. He, however, is an individual and there is no guarantee that the school would continue to function if he were to depart.\n\nTo summarize therefore, we cannot recommend the establishment of two Protestant Residential Schools in or near Whitehorse when educational facilities for Indians are so badly needed elsewhere.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MMcN\nOTTAWA, March 16, 1950.\n\nJ. A. Simmons, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Simmons:\n\nI am returning herewith the letter you received from Reverend H.I. Lee, Principal of the Whitehorse Indian Mission School.\n\nThe subject matter of Mr. Lee's letter has been given careful consideration by the officials of Indian Affairs, including the writer, and I may say at the outset that this Branch could not entertain, at this time, the proposal involving the construction of another residential school in the Yukon-Northern British Columbia section of Canada.\n\nAs you know, we are committed to the construction of the first unit of a new residential school to replace the school at Carcross, operated under the auspices of the Church of England. In addition to this, the Branch this year is undertaking the construction of a new residential school at Lower Post, immediately south of the Yukon-British Columbia Boundary, to serve both the Yukon Territory and northern parts of British Columbia. It is our hope that these schools will, when completed, meet to a very large extent the residential school needs of the Indians of those sections. We are, of course, prepared to extend the day school system as and when the need arises.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the good work that has been accomplished at the Whitehorse School under the direction of Mr. Lee. He has carried on under difficult circumstances and much credit is due him for the success of the school operated under his direction.\nThe circumstances are such, however, that we are not in a position to do more to assist in the educational work now being carried on by Mr. Lee than what this Branch is doing at present, unless it is by way of some minor changes in the arrangement now in existence.\n\nI am forwarding for your personal information a copy of a memorandum to me from the Superintendent of Indian Education, Mr. B.F. Neary, on the subject.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1950   | Vete 316.04.352                                                         |        |\n| Feb. 9 | To: Freight charges on one package of school supplies, Whitehorse, Y.T. | $1.67  |\n|        | to Lower Post Seasonal School as paid by Father Turenne.                |        |\n|        | Receipt bill attached.                                                  |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Larken in regards to a piano which she has for sale.\n\nI am wondering if perhaps your department will consider the purchase of this piano for The Indian Day School here. We are in great need of a piano for our social activities for the children here at school.\n\nThis would save the department considerably in the way of transportation charges etc., if this can be arranged.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nRev.

Larkin,\nBox 87,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI attach hereto letter of Miss H. Larkin, P.H.N., Indian Health Services, recently of Whitehorse, to the Rev. H.I.

Lee, Whitehorse Indian School in this connection.\n\nI might state that some ten children of the Indian School are now taking piano lessons from a teacher in Whitehorse. The pupils pay their own tuition costs. A piano for practice purposes is supplied by Rev. Lee at the school, but it is an old one, and a replacement or extra piano is needed.\n\nI do not know the policy of the Department with regards to supplying pianos to schools.

show some of the art work done in the classes conducted by Miss Lillias Farley who divides her time between our school and the larger Yukon Territory school in Whitehorse. The children work in paper, cloth (with which Mrs. Meek and Miss Ruth Sconholz are associated), leather, sheet metal, plaster, and wood. Miss Farley is adept in various graphic and plastic arts.\n\nShe made a special appointment with Mr. Supt. Meek and me to discuss an increase in salary. She thinks that an proportional increase, based on the rate of increase for academic teachers would be justified. It is to be noted that she does not draw the northern allowance. She is employed nine hours a week in our Department's service. Could she be granted nine-twenty-fifths of the northern allowance. I cannot see how we can increase the number of hours which she gives to the Whitehorse School. She would not be easy to replace.\n\nI should like to see her put on paper the plans for work next year which she discussed with me, and elaborate her objectives and the methods and time which she proposes to use to accomplish agreed objectives.\n\nThe classroom which has been established for this work is a superior installation.\n\nC.A.F.

Lee for the rental of classrooms at Whitehorse is supported by a reference to me.\n\nThe subject came up for discussion when I was at Whitehorse in June as a result of Departmental letter this file dated May 1 which stated that as the Department does not own these buildings, funds cannot be provided for painting them. On being asked whether the Department would pay rent for the buildings I suggested that an application for payment of rent by the Department would receive consideration.\n\nThe bill as submitted appears to be retroactive in the case of the classrooms to the first of September, 1949 and in regard to the two Arts rooms to the first of January, 1950, when they were taken into use after a considerable sum had been spent in making them ready for their specialized purposes.\n\nMr. Superintendent Meek and the Reverend H.I. Lee seem to have overlooked the fact 16 of the children attending this school are of non-Indian status and are the responsibility of the Yukon Territorial Government. I do not know what the Y.T. Government allows this school other than about $1.25 a day for the maintenance of boarders. Our Department still holds the figure to 95\u00a2 a day.\nThere is no denying that the buildings require painting and other maintenance and that the sum charged for the rental of the classrooms is quite moderate considering their size and appointments and the location of the school. The Reverend Mr. Lee hopes to have the buildings painted this summer. If they remain unpainted local residents and visitors may ask why and will, of course, be told that the Department has declined to purchase any paint and has not been paying rent for the buildings.\n\nThe question arises as to whether some written agreement for the use of the classrooms should be required and stating what the obligations of the landlord are in the case.\n\nC.A.F.

This list was drawn up after enquiries into school facilities and the practical use of the training to Indian girls.\n\nMy wife, Mrs. Thelma Meek, a qualified sewing instructress, Household Economics, Queens, 1934, has volunteered to supervise a Remake and a Dressmaking Class if requisitioned articles are received. She has also offered to give a course in Sewing and Home Decoration to one of the teachers at the Indian School, who will in turn also teach the girls at the school.\n\nI might add that the Whitehorse Indian School receives a lot of second hand clothing from white people locally and from Outside. It is necessary for almost all of this clothing to be altered or remade before it can be given to the children. At present the limited facilities at the school do not permit the best use to be made of these clothes.\n\n(H.J.

Mr. Donald Armour, manual training teacher at the Yukon Territorial School at Whitehorse, has applied for the position of Manual Training Teacher (part-time) at the local Indian School. Appropriate form completed by Mr. Armour is attached hereto.\n\nThe applicant has had previous experience as a manual training teacher. He is being employed for the present school term at Whitehorse Territorial School. Mr. L. Todd, principal of the Territorial School recommends Mr. Armour as a teacher.\n\nRev. Lee has a reasonable amount of space for a manual training workshop. The tools will be kept under lock and key on the school premises. I would recommend that the application be accepted.\n\n(R.J.

Meek,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, YUKON.\n\nWhitehorse Indian School - Manual Training\n\nReference is to your letter of September 7th.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. Donald Armour is employed part-time by the Whitehorse Territorial School what possibility is there of making an arrangement with the local school authorities whereby the children of Mr. Lee's school could receive instruction in Manual Training at the Territorial school? In investigating this possibility, you would have to find out:\n\n(a) How many pupils from Mr. Lee's school will receive Manual Training?\n(b) How many of these pupils are of non-Indian status?\n(c) How many pupils will the Whitehorse Territorial School accommodate at one session?\n(d) How much would Mr. Armour charge for one three-hour session per week?\n(e) Would there be any charge for the use of facilities at the Territorial school? (You imply that these facilities and the instructor are occupied only part-time.)\n(f) If it is not possible for the boys from Mr. Lee's school to attend for Manual Training in one group would they be permitted to mingle with the classes presently being conducted at the Territorial school? If so, would there be any charge for this?\n\nIf the arrangements suggested above cannot be made, and it is hoped that they can be, further consideration is required concerning the installation of these facilities at our Indian school.\nFirstly, further details are required concerning Mr. Armour's application which he has only partly completed. He states he is married but has he any dependents? Where are his wife and children if any? He claims Grade twelve education but where did he receive it? Where else other than at Whitehorse school and for how long in each case did he teach Manual Training? What remuneration does he receive from the Territorial Government for his services, and how much of his time is already occupied in the teaching of Manual Training? How much time is it suggested that he give to the Whitehorse Indian school? What remuneration therefor is suggested?\n\nRegarding accommodation for Manual Training at the Indian school you state that there is an \"ample amount of space\" available. What are the dimensions of this room? How many boys can be accommodated at one session? Are there any work benches available? Where would the tools be kept in relation to this room?

Meek, Superintendent of Indian Agency, Whitehorse, Y.T., has been received in this office. The account includes an item of $2.65 for freight. Please forward a receipt from the transportation company as present regulations require us to have this receipt before passing the account for payment.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhitehorse Indian School - Manual Training\n\nYour letter of September 14th, file 929-11 (E3) on the above subject. I have interviewed Mr. Armour, manual training teacher, Mr. Todd, principal Territorial School, and the Rev. Lee, director Whitehorse Indian School on the points raised by you. We find the present arrangements at the Territorial School poor for manual training, only 14 pupils can be accommodated in the room, and the principal is looking for a more satisfactory manual training workshop. Mr. Todd would like to make arrangements with this Branch to use suitable space in the Indian School, the manual training room to be used by both schools on a mutually satisfactory schedule.\n\nReplying to your queries in proper order:\n\n(a) At September 30th, 26 pupils from Mr. Lee's school would be eligible and capable of manual training.\n(b) Seven of these are of non-Indian status.\n(c) As mentioned above: 14.\n(d) Mr. Armour charges $5.00 per one-hour period, scaling down with increase in hours, i.e., $30.00 for a week of 8 periods.\n(e) Territorial school facilities are not satisfactory.\n(f) Not a suitable arrangement.\n\nRegarding Mr. Armour's application: he is married, no dependents. His wife lives in Edmonton. He received all his education in Glasgow. He taught for two years in public schools in Toronto. At the present time Mr. Armour receives $5.00 per hour; he teaches 10 periods a week, this represents about 50% of his occupied time. For the Indian school it was suggested the class be divided in two, with instruction from 3:15 to 5 PM, for four days a week; this plan is tentative and it would have to be given a trial to note its efficacy. I would suggest Mr. Armour be offered $25.00 per week.\n\nReference your fourth paragraph: the Rev. Lee has a room available measuring 20' x 50', it is well lighted, has a good floor, electricity, toilet facilities adjacent, and can be heated with wood fires. Twenty pupils can be accommodated at one time without crowding. There are 13 work benches available at the Territorial School, with material available for additional benches and projects.\nThe tools would be kept under lock and key in the manual training room. Tools and equipment provided by each institution would be kept separate though it is very probable that some things would be used in common. Heating is by wood stoves, lighting by ample window space and electric lights.\n\nWith the above arrangements, there would be no need for parallel arrangements for the girls. However, if the condition arises, sewing classes have been arranged for the girls.\n\nThere are at present about 50 boys at the Territorial School receiving manual training, just about double the number at the Indian School. The heads of both schools are in agreement with the plan suggested above, and the Rev. Lee is willing to make suitable alterations for a manual training workshop.\n\n(R.J.

As the Territory hopes to set up its own establishment some day and would likely want some of its property returned, careful inventories will have to be kept.\n\nIn a discussion with the high school principal I learned that all local officials concerned were in favour of an arrangement whereby the public school would have the use of the room daily from one to three o'clock in the afternoon, and that the Indian school class would be conducted on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from three to five o'clock. I suppose that the Indian boys might be allowed in at other times under supervision (by someone other than the instructor).\n\nIt was stated that the instructor, Mr. Donald Armour, could be obtained for $100 a month, but I offered the opinion that, in view of his probable grading by our rules, $75 is a more appropriate figure. He will average about twenty-five hours a month. Besides, the art teacher, Miss Farley, will average thirty-nine hours a month for a salary of $100, and her qualifications in her field appear to be superior to Mr. Armour's in his.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Calgary\nSuperintendent, Yukon Agency\nNovember 18, 1949.\n\nMr. R. J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nWhitehorse Indian Day School.\n\n(a) Manual Training.\n\nWe have noted Major Clark's report of November 11 with a recommendation that we establish a manual training shop at Whitehorse. I am not quite clear as to whether this will be a joint enterprise but gather that it is. If so, why are the Indian school boys to be taught from 3 to 5 while the white children attend from 1 to 3. As it is an Indian school (?) why should not the Indian children attend at the best time.\n\nI am aware of the plans to erect a large school at Whitehorse and wonder whether we could not have our Indian children sent to this public school as we are doing elsewhere across the country. I of course am not aware of local feeling but as other school boards are admitting more and more Indian children, I wonder whether the time is ripe for such a suggestion at Whitehorse.\n\n(b) Handicrafts\n\nYou may purchase $75.00 in handicraft materials for use by Miss Farley, as requested in your requisition of October 26.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nYour form letter, file 929-11 (E.4), dated October 7th, 1949, concerning Purchase Order 47177, for two sewing machines for the Whitehorse Indian School.\n\nI beg to advise that two machines have been delivered to the school, and were vouchered for by me on October 4th, my voucher No. 589, for $123.65.\n\nR.J. Meek\n\n(H.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nWhitehorse Indian Day School\n\nReference your letter of 18th instant, file 929-11 (E), and Manual Training. The establishment of a manual training shop at the above school will be a joint enterprise between this Branch and the Yukon Territorial Government insofar as the same teacher will be used under two different arrangements, and the same shop will be used. It is also likely that some tools will be used jointly by the different institutions, but as the Territorial School already has a moderate supply of tools, and as this Branch will obtain tools independently, it is not a joint enterprise in the full sense of the word.\n\nThe reason the Indian school boys will be taught between 3 and 5 PM is because the three teachers of the Indian school requested it. The average age of Indian children is considerably above the corresponding grade at the Territorial School, consequently our own teachers do not wish to lose a minute of teaching time. Also as almost all the boys are boarding at the school, there is not a great deal for them to do after school during the winter months when it gets dark so early.\n\nRegarding your second paragraph; the Yukon School Ordinance does not discriminate against Indians, but the several times Indian children were placed in Territorial Schools it ended as a fiasco. A case as recent as 1947 happened at Mayo. Neither the administration nor the teachers would discourage admitting Indians to Territorial Schools, it is always a few parents who raise a violent objection. Regardless of this, I believe the time is at hand when the suggestion of admitting senior grade Indian pupils into Territorial Schools should be made. Most of the Indian children would have to be maintained at some institution, as the parents live away from Whitehorse.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\nDecember 15th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nRe: Whitehorse Indian Day School\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of November 24th in connection with the arrangements that you can make with the Yukon Territorial Government for manual training instruction at the above school.\n\nWe have also received a letter from Mr. C.A.F. Clark, our Educational Survey Officer, regarding the same matter, and we are prepared to allow the teacher that is being employed $75.00 a month. Mr. Clark understood that the teacher would give approximately 25 hours instruction a month to the Indian children. If he is prepared to accept this amount, you can make complete arrangements with him and you can forward a monthly Voucher for the amount that we have agreed to allow.\n\nYou may also purchase expendable material to an amount of $90.00.\n\nA requisition should be forwarded for the tools that you consider are needed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhitehorse Indian Day School\n\nReference your letter of 15th instant, file 949-11 (El) and the matter of manual training instruction at the above school. I have seen Mr. Donald Armour who is agreeable to a salary of $75.00 a month for approximately 25 hours teaching time to pupils of the above school.\n\nThese arrangements have been given to Yukon Territory officials. Mr. C. Bidlake, Territorial Agent, Whitehorse, informs me the following telegram has been received by him:\n\n\"Commissioner authorizes removal of tools and material to Lee's school stop. Details regarding sharing of expense with Indian Affairs Branch can be arranged later.\"\n\n(signed) R.H. Hulland\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nMr. Hulland is at Dawson and is fully conversant with all aspects of this arrangement. Work has already been started on the new manual training room. Mr. Armour is doing most of the alterations himself in the building owned by Rev. H.I. Lee. He estimates cost of new materials, lumber, nails, alterations to lights, etc., a maximum cost of $400.00. Is it in order for Indian Affairs Branch to pay 50 per cent. of the total cost of alterations desired by Mr. Armour.\n\nH.J. Meek\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nJanuary 14, 1950.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWhitehorse Indian Day School\n\nReference your letter of December 23\n\nWe regret that shortage of funds at the present time does not permit an expenditure on the Manual Training room at the above school.\n\nWould you please bring this matter forward again in April when new funds will be available.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MMcN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhitehorse Indian School\n\nI attach hereto a requisition for tools for Manual Training shop at the above school. Regulation forms apparently not suitable for this sort of requisition. Same is signed by Mr. D. Armour, teacher.\n\nWhile the use of power tools might effect a certain economy of wood, material and time, I do not feel our Indian pupils are quite ready for the use of such equipment.\n\nEighteen work benches have now been set up and are being used by the Indian boys at the above school.\n\n(R.J.

During the Christmas holidays, Mr. Armour, the manual training instructor, brought over from the Territorial School, benches, tools, and equipment including a few power tools, in readiness for the reopening of school after the holidays. At the request of our day school teachers, the Indian pupils are to receive manual training from 3:15 PM to 5 PM three days per week. This tends to upset the day school schedule much less than if such training were given at the expense of day school time.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**Form No. IA.506A**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Don.

Some of the requirements in the list for Third Year seem very advanced indeed and would be a challenge for adult minds.\n\nMr. Armour has requested permission to use the programme laid down by Territorial school officials until our own requirements are brought more into keeping with the abilities of the pupils.\n\nI am not certain if you require a list of all pupils given instruction who are attending the Whitehorse Indian School. As you are aware, a number of half-breed children, the responsibility and charge of the Yukon Territory, are in attendance at the Whitehorse Indian School, and are taught in our classrooms. Do you wish a record kept by the manual training instructor of these children of non-Indian status?\n\nYour comments regarding Mr. Armour's views on the Manual Training curriculum would be appreciated.\n\n(R.J.

Meek with regard to a shipment made to the Whitehorse Indian School. Mr. Meek has forwarded the accounts which he received from you.\n\nHowever, on reviewing the accounts, we consider that a mistake has been made in the extension for the first two items on Invoice 54343. We think that the proper extension for the first item should be $7.72 and $7.90 for the second item.\n\nThere is also a charge on the account for $2.45 for air express. When returning the account you should attach to it a receipt from the express company, as present regulations require us to have a receipt for such expenses.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1950     | Yukon Agency Vote $16-12-415 Education                                  |        |\n| March 23 | To tracing paper, brushes, paint and postage, for art class at Whitehorse Indian School, as ordered by Miss Ida Farley, Arts Teacher.

Some of the machinery and tools belong to the Y.T. school.\n\nThe power tools are used by the Instructors (here seen) Mr. Butterfield who has replaced Mr. Armour (the necessary forms should come forward).\n\nThe long benches should by degrees be replaced with two-boy benches to be made in the shop, and some modification of the lighting system should be considered.\n\nA greater amount of money should be made available for expendable material to be used by the boys.\n\nNeeded also are about Sixty copies of the Department's curriculum for first year woodwork, and ten for second-year woodwork.\n\nI hope to see some work done on motor mechanics later.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Butterfield should put more emphasis on drawing and cutting to measurement. It is easy to check any misuse of tools by pupils who have not learned to respect the functions of each tool. E.G. A mallet must not be used to drive nails.\n\nThe requisition for next year should include sharpening stones.\n\nC.A.F.

Donald Miller was the adopted son of Dick Bean Charlie, 005, Whitehorse Band. His mother and father are dead.\n\nThe death was reported to me at 8:00 A.M. on morning of February 22nd, by the Rev. H.I. Lee, Director of the Indian School. Enquiry into death was made by Board of Enquiry as per instructions, consisting of Dr. W.C. Stewart, the Rev. H.I. Lee and myself.\n\nDue to the cause of death, Dr. Stewart does not think that any action taken by the school staff could have saved the boy.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\n\nc.c. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 1, 1951.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing memorandum of an inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Donald Miller. We were quite concerned when we noted that the boy died of Tuberculous Meningitis.\n\nThis boy was a resident of the hostel section of the Whitehorse Day School, and we have been paying for his maintenance. We presumed that all children were being medically examined before they entered the school, and a serious condition might develop if there are any other pupils in this hostel suffering from Tuberculosis.\n\nIt is noted that many of the application forms have been signed by a registered nurse and not by a doctor. Are you certain that every possible precaution is being taken to insure that only medically fit children are being admitted to the hostel? As a result of this boy's death has any effort been made to have the other children medically examined at once to make certain that there are no other children suffering from Tuberculosis?\n\nWe have submitted the whole matter to the Indian Health Services and they intend to bring it to the attention of Dr. Falconer, but in any case, we would like to have a reply to this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nA/Superintendent of Education\n\nPP/ST\nDr. W. L. Falconer,\nMedical Director,\nCharles Camell Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Dr. Falconer:\n\nRes: Donald Miller, Age 10, Whitehorse.\n\nFollowing is a Clinical History of the above-mentioned boy.\n\nDonald Miller had been a pupil at Whitehorse Indian School for the past 4 years. He seemed a normal child except for the fact that on occasions he had violent night-mares. He also had emesis unless roused at 11.30 p.m. to void. Medical advice about this was sought from Drs. Ziskrout and Pelletier but upon examining the child, they did not prescribe any medication. Reports here indicate the child had a negative chest x-ray in February 1949 and August 1950. He was immunized against Diphtheria and Whooping-Cough in 1949.\n\nDonald had what seemed to be a slight cold for several days and on Monday, Feb. 19th, complained of headache. As 'flu was prevalent in the town the boy was sent to bed in the sick-ward of the school. He was kept on soft diet and fluids were forced. At no time was his temperature, which was taken twice daily, over 100 degrees. The headache persisted. On Wednesday, Feb. 21st, Donald had a poached egg on toast for his supper but complained of nausea and was unable to eat it all. However he was apparently asleep when the boy's supervisor made rounds at 9 P.M. At 11.30 P.M. efforts were made to rouse him to void. He seemed in a coma and Mr. Lee, School Principal, was summoned. He called the Doctor at once.\n\nI am sorry you received the unreliable information that Dr. Stewart did not see this patient before he died. Dr. Stewart was called at 11.45 p.m. and responded immediately to the call. He examined the boy at the school then personally took him to the Hospital. Here a Spinal Puncture was done and Penicillin administered. The boy died several hours later and Dr. Stewart, to verify his diagnosis, had an autopsy done. The specimen was sent to the Provincial Laboratory at Edmonton and a reply has not as yet been received.\n\nEach child is given a medical examination when he is enrolled at the school for the first time. Unless specially indicated, he is not given a medical examination at the start of the succeeding term, especially if he has had a negative x-ray that year. However, each child has a medical examination some time during the school term.\n\nThe school has a good infirmary for both boys and girls and one supervisor is specially appointed to care for any patients. It is her custom to notify me when any child has the slightest ailment and Dr. Stewart is always called if there is the slightest indication of anything serious. In this instance I was at Mayo and was not available.\n\nThere was absolutely no evidence of neglect on the part of anyone. Special commendation is due Mr. Lee's Staff for the very excellent care given to the children at the school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nCopy: Dr. Wm. C. Stewart.\nDr. E.L.

Wilson\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 929-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of lst instant, file 929-23 (El) re death of Donald Miller, a pupil of the Whitehorse Indian Day School. All pupils are examined by Dr. W.C. Stewart or Miss A. Wilson, R.N., Indian Health Services, shortly after they arrive at the school for admittance.\n\nRegarding the medical examination of children by Nurse Wilson, my Quarterly Report October - December 1950, page 6 stated that Dr. Stewart was the only civilian doctor in Whitehorse and he was not always available to examine school pupils. He is aware of Nurse Wilson's outstanding qualifications and her examinations have his consent. In addition, throughout the year Miss Wilson has clinics two or three times a week at the Whitehorse Indian Day School, and a complete record is kept of the medical history of each child.\n\nA copy of a letter to Miss Wilson and Dr. Stewart from Dr. W.L. Falconer, Charles Camell Hospital, Edmonton, has been received asking for a Clinical History and other information on Donald Miller. I am attaching copy of Miss Wilson's report to Dr. Falconer.\n\nAn effort was made immediately on the death of Donald Miller to have every child at the school X-rayed; as the Whitehorse General Hospital could not handle mass X-rays permission was given by Dr. E.L. Stone, C.M.G., Regional Supt., I.H.S., to have the children X-rayed at the Army Hospital, and I understand this is being done today under the direction of Dr. Stewart and one of the R.C.A.M.C. doctors.\n\nDonald Miller has been a pupil of the Whitehorse Indian Day School since it opened over four years ago. He has been X-rayed each year and examined a number of occasions by different I.H.S. nurses; when he was taken to the hospital Dr. Stewart stayed with him from before midnight to 2 A.M. administering professional treatment. Donald died at 3 A.M. I am satisfied that every effort is made to admit only medically fit pupils to the school, and that everything possible was done to care for Donald Miller.\n\nc.c.

In intellectual capacity and industry these Indians seem to be amongst the best in the Yukon. It will be noticed that many of the young men are anxious to learn. The children also seem promising. One boy, fifteen years of age went out trapping by himself during the past winter and sold his furs for $96.00.\n\n2. The conditions in relation to marriage are not wholly satisfactory. Christian marriage is generally recognized, a religious service based upon that of the Presbyterian Church being used. There are, however, cases of bigamy, discarding the first wife, etc.\n\n3. In addition to those of which particulars are given, a number of the Teslin Lake Indians at present reside at Atlin, but it is thought that many of these would return if a school were established at the Lake; It seems manifest that such result would be in the best interests of the Indians and their children.\n\n4. Father Allard has been since June devoting himself to work among the Indians residing at Atlin and has purchased a building to be used as a school.\n\n5. At Teslin Lake the Indians conduct each Sunday two services in the native language, using prayers, hymns and chants taught them by the Russian Church at Juneau. Much superstition is mingled with these services, but all the people join in them and seem earnest and reverent.\n\n6. These Indians request that the Government and the Church of England should send them a teacher who will conduct\nconduct a school for the children and young people and also teach Christianity to all. They offer to undertake a share of the support of such teacher by providing such articles as meat, fish and wood. Messrs. Taylor and Drury, proprietors of the Trading Post, also express a strong desire that this be done and offer to help.\n\n7. One of the Indians, Edgar Sidney, was educated at a Presbyterian school in Sitka and was baptized in the Russian Church, of which he became a communicant. He speaks English well and has an English Bible with which by orally translating he teaches the people. He desires further training with a view to being an ordained minister. It is possible that with some assistance he might translate portions of the Scriptures into the Klinkit language. Any such translation would be useful for some thousands of Indians along the Coast of Alaska speaking the same language.\n\n8. The Government has so far done nothing for the Teslin Lake Indians.\n\nSeptember 1907, A.E. O'M.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nTeslin Lake School.\n\nYukon.\n\nCorrespondence.\nToronto, March 12th, 1909.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Department, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nUpon the occasion of our recent interview the work connected with the Day School which has recently been established by the Church of England at Nisutlin Bay, Teslin Lake, was fully explained, and it was understood that I should lay before the Department a formal application for an additional grant to be made from the current year's appropriation towards the support of that work.\n\nI have since had opportunity of conferring with Bishop Stringer regarding the amount which it would be reasonable to ask the Department to contribute for that purpose, and now beg to make application for a total grant of $1150.00 made up as follows:\n\n- Salary of J.R. Bythell for 9 months at $50.00........... $450.00\n- Mr. Bythell's travelling expenses within the Territory. (Estimated)......................... 100.00\n- Buildings now in course of construction............. 500.00\n- Furnishing and equipment.......................... 100.00\n\nTotal...................... $1150.00\n\nLet me add a few words of explanation. The salary which is being paid to Mr. Bythell is at the rate of $600.00 per annum. Of the travelling expenses we have not full particulars.\nAs you are aware however such expenses are very heavy in the Yukon, and the Church has paid in addition the expenses incurred in travelling to the Yukon. With regard to the amount asked for buildings it is well to have in mind that the Government probably could not in the ordinary course of business erect the same buildings for twice the money. You will remember that Mr. Bythell expected to secure voluntary help from prospectors in the construction.\n\nA cheque for the amount decided upon may be made out in my favor and sent to Wycliffe College, Toronto.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFinancial Secretary,\nDiocese of Yukon.\nOttawa, April 26th., 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI have to inform you that an application made by the Rev. A. E. O'Meara on behalf of the Day School which it is proposed to establish at Teslin Lake has received consideration. The Department will be disposed to allow a salary of $500.00 per annum for the teacher, and $300.00 for the rental of the building in which the School is to be conducted. The continuance of the grant will be contingent upon the results obtained from year to year at the School. Payments will be made in the usual way, and the grant may take effect from the 1st. of January last, if the School was then in operation and if the usual returns are forthcoming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Department,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to your kind letter stating that Seven hundred Dollars per annum would be allowed for salary and rent in connection with the Teslin Lake Day School; I have been informed by Rev. A.E.O. Meara that it is necessary for you to have a definite statement regarding the date on which the school was commenced. I wish to state that I have a report from J.R. Bythell, who is in charge, stating that the school was commenced on the Thirteenth day of August 1908. I understand from Mr. O'Meara that you have on file in your office a statement showing the number and age of the Indians at Teslin Lake. Mr. Bythell tells me that practically all the Indians, who are capable of learning at all, attend the school when they are in the neighbourhood. The attendance, however, varies very much because the Indians go off on hunting expeditions and return again for a time to the vicinity of the school. Mr. Bythell reported twenty as enrolled but there will be considerable variation in the attendance. It would be almost impossible to get a regular report quarterly as the communication with Teslin Lake is uncertain. I shall see that reports are sent to you from time to time. However I shall be glad if you will make a proportionate\ngrant up to say the end of March. If you will kindly do so please send a cheque to Rev. A.R.O'Meara, Conrad, Yukon, Canada, made out in his favour.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\n\nP.S. I shall be out of reach of Communication for the Summer as I am now starting for Mackenzie River. After September my address will be Carcross, Yukon, Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 930-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 7, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 20th ult., relative to the proposed grant to the Indian day school at Teslin Lake, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it will be unable to accede to your request to make any payment before the returns are received, as they constitute the vouchers which are necessary to show that the school has been in operation.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. O'Meara, Treasurer of the Yukon Diocese, is being advised to this effect.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. L.O.

Sir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Stringer has asked for payment for the Teslin school from the date of its commencement, but, as no returns have been received to show that the school is in operation, the Department has advised His Lordship that it regrets that his request cannot be complied with. As soon as returns are received payment of the grant will be made to you as Treasurer of the Diocese.\n\nThe Department has informed His Lordship that it will allow salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum and $300.00 rental for the building. Vouchers for the quarterly rent should also be sent to the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. A.E.

Bythewell\n\nPresent address\nWycliffe College\nToronto.\n\nTeacher\nParticulars regarding Indians of Teslin Lake.\n\nThe Indians at Teslin Lake are known as the Klinkits. The tribe numbers about 80 including men, women and children. Their chief occupation is hunting and trapping. They leave Teslin Lake, their headquarters about first week in September to engage in their work of hunting and trapping furs until June or July when they return with their winter's catch and spend the summer there.\n\nWhen I arrived at Teslin Lake August 13th 1908, I only found about one third of the tribe there, the others having left for their hunting grounds only two days before. With the assistance of two young Indians, I erected a temporary school and started to give instruction the same day (Aug 13th 08). Of the 26 Indians who were there, 20 came to school. Those who could not come to day school owing to work generally attended my special class which I held every evening.\nWhen these Indians were leaving I gave to each a book containing writing exercises and instructions how to write them and also sent books to many who had gone out before I got there.\n\nDuring the winter I visited as many of my scholars as it was possible for me to reach. At each camp I would stop long enough to review their work and assign more writing exercises, and also give medicine to those who needed it. Of course I held religious services on all my visits.\n\nThose whom I could not reach generally sent their exercise books with other Indians who came in for supplies at Xmas time.\n\nIn the spring with the assistance of two other white men, I erected a building which we used as a Church and day school. This building was not quite ready when the Indians came in, in June. I called on them for help and they willingly set to work and finished it so that we were able to start school July 5th.\nThey showed their great appreciation of their new school by regular attendance. Thirty-eight were enrolled on my register, and many others not able to attend day school owing to building boats etc., came to the special classes which I held the evenings of the week.\n\nThe attendance at school continued very good, unfortunately I did not get the supply of books and pencils I had ordered. We used rough building paper and small pieces of pencil tied to pieces of sticks but even these crude materials could not last, so we were forced to close school about three weeks earlier than if our supplies had come.\n\nI was very sorry to see them going away without their exercise books, which they begged for and had had the previous fall.\n\nI might say that besides teaching school, I held regular religious services and Sunday school, also administered...\nmedicine and did all I could to relieve suffering. I had twenty-four cases of sickness and attended to cuts and wounds of various descriptions. No death occurred.\n\nThe Klinkitis are an unusually healthy tribe. They are also very clean and industrious, and rather intelligent. They are very anxious to learn to read and write.\n\nThey are also Patriotic and regularly celebrate Canada's Birthday, July 1st, by sports and decorations. As to their moral character, they are far above the average Indian, a quiet peaceful well-behaved people.\n\nThe Klinkiti Indians will likely be coming into their headquarters about June the 1st. I left Tulin Lake Oct 1st 1907.\n\nJ.M. Bythell.\n\nToronto Dec 3rd 1907.\nin their camps, but has also devised and partially carried out a system by which all the Indians are enabled to continue their school work in the camps. Other special features of the work are the attendance of adults and the evening classes, of which no particulars appear on the school reports, no roll of these classes having been kept.\n\nI also ask special attention to the fact that medical help has been given.\n\nThe total amount expended by the Church to date upon this work is the sum of $2,269.25 made up as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salary 15th June, '08 to 11th October, '09        | $1,055.55|\n| Travelling Expenses to and from Yukon and in Territory | 375.80   |\n| School Supplies                                  | 22.25    |\n| Total Current Expenditure                         | 1,458.60 |\n| Building and Equipment                            | 612.65   |\n| Total Expenditure                                 | $2,269.25|\n\nI may explain that Mr. Rythell reached the Yukon on 15th June, 1908 but was delayed until August in reaching Teslin Lake.\n\nI trust that the Department will consider all the special circumstances affecting this new work in a remote part of the Territory and will make as large a\ngrant as possible towards the amount so expended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFinancial Secretary,\nDiocese of Yukon.\nWycliffe College,\nToronto, Dec. 17, 1908\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn pursuance of interview had last month with Mr. D. C. Scott, I now enclose a statement of particulars regarding Indians of Teslin Lake furnished by Mr. J. R. Bythell our Missionary who has had charge of the work in that District, and also two school reports.\n\nYou have on file copy of the report regarding these Indians made by myself in September, 1907, including an \"additional memo\" which you will find attached.\n\nIn one respect the conditions would appear to be different from what we understood. Information secured in 1907 from sources thought quite reliable showed that during eight months of the year the Indians spent most of their time at their headquarters. Mr. Bythell's statement indicates that at least in some years the time of absence is much longer, and that the time spent at headquarters may sometimes not exceed four months or even be less. I am inclined, however, to think that in other\nyears the length of their stay may be considerably more than four months. Naturally Mr. Rythell's estimate is based upon his own experience. My suggestion that the time spent at headquarters may vary a good deal from year to year is confirmed by what Messrs. Vowell and Green say regarding these Indians in their report of 14th August, 1908, from which I quote one sentence\u2014\"They are hunters and are away from their village on Teslin Lake about six months of the year.\"\n\nOf course in order to do anything for these people it was necessary to send in a worker for a definite length of time. It may I think be reasonably suggested that only by practical experience can either the Government or the Church fully know the conditions and make permanent plans for meeting them. At the same time I recognize that in finally deciding the amount of the grant to be made\u2014will necessarily take into account the difference to which I have referred. Perhaps, however, that difference is more material as affecting future grants than it is in relation to the amount to be granted towards the expenditure already made, which we considered to be justified by our own information and by the report of Messrs. Vowell and Green.\n\nYou will notice that our Missionary has not only visited and taught the Indians who could be reached\nOttawa, December 13th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing a statement from Mr. J. R. Rythell showing the periods during which the Indian school at Teslin Lake was in operation during the summer months of the years 1908 and 1909.\n\nThe offer made by the Department in a letter addressed to His Lordship the Bishop of the Yukon on April 26th, last, was to pay a salary of $500.00 per annum for a teacher at this point and $200.00 for rental of the building. The returns forwarded by Mr. Rythell would show that the school was in operation 21 days during 1908 and 33 days during the past summer, a total of 54 days. There are 216 teaching days in the school year and the Department will, therefore, pay $\\frac{54}{216}$ of $500.00, or $125.00. A cheque for this amount will be sent you.\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Rythell's report that the arrangements for opening a permanent school at this point are premature as the nomadic habits of the Indians prevent their taking advantage of a school except for a very short time each summer, and, in view of this fact, the Department will consider the advisability of withdrawing from the arrangement in the meantime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo I beg to enclose herewith a copy of the report on the Teslin Lake day school for the years 1908 and 1909, as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nREV. A. E. O'Meara,\nCarcross, Yukon.\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI write you with reference to the Indian Day School at Teslin Lake. In order that the matter may be clearly brought before you, please refer to your letter of April 26th, 1909, No. 338199/1, also your letter of Dec. 13th, 1909, No. 338199/1 addressed to the Rev. A.E. O'Meara.\n\nIn December, 1909, you forwarded to the Rev. A.E. O'Meara, who was acting as my financial secretary, the sum of One Hundred and Twenty Five Dollars, towards the expenses of Teslin Lake School. In making up the amount due even on your own calculation, you omitted the amount for rental of building, which at Two Hundred Dollars per annum, for fifty-four days, would have been Fifty Dollars. I hope, however, that you will be able to make a larger allowance than you proposed in your letter of Dec. 13th, 1909.\n\nYou state that you can only give an allowance for the actual number of days during which school was taught. Allow me to bring to your notice some of the circumstances connected with the Teslin Lake School. After careful consideration, and on the urgent request of the Indians, the school was opened in 1908. In\norder that the school should be started, a man had to be sent to\nthe place, and he had to reside there a considerable portion of\nthe year, to take advantage of the visits of the Indians. Mr.\nJ.R. Bythell began the work. I paid his travelling expenses from\nToronto, and his salary had to be paid from the time he was\nemployed. Then buildings had to be erected at Teslin Lake at\nconsiderable cost. From June 1908 to 1909, the sum of over Two\nThousand Dollars was spent in connection with the Teslin Lake\nSchool. Mr. Bythell held himself in readiness to teach whenever\nthe Indians came in from their hunting grounds. He also some-\ntimes followed them to their camps, and encouraged and directed\nthem in keeping up their school work. He also held night school\nfor the adults. In this way a great deal more teaching was\ndone, than could be put down on school returns. I think the\nprogress made by the Indians has justified the opening of the\nschool, and it would be a great pity to give it up. Mr. C.J. Brett\nis now in charge of the school, and taught the Indians during the\nSummer of 1910. The returns have been sent in to your department\nthrough Mr. T.G. Bragg, Superintendent of schools for Yukon. Mr.\nBrett is this Winter teaching at Champagne Landing, where the\nIndians assemble during the Winter. He hopes in the Spring to\nreturn to Teslin Lake, where the Indians come together for a\ntime during the Summer. In this way, his services as teacher, will\nMr. Bythell's time, however, was spent entirely at Teslin Lake during the two years 1908 and 1909, and the progress among the Indians, has in my opinion, justified it. It is a question of giving those people such teaching as is possible under the circumstances. The decision of your Department, in offering to give towards the support of the school as shown in your letter of April 26th, 1909, was apparently arrived at, after you received the report of Messrs. Vowell & Green, who got their information concerning Teslin Lake, from the Indians. I would draw your attention to a letter written you by the Rev. A.E. O'Meara, under date of Dec. 8th, 1909, which I authorized him to write you. That letter explains our position at the time.\n\nI hope you will take into consideration these circumstances as mentioned above, and allow, at least for the first year or two, the full amount suggested in your letter of April 26th, 1909.\n\nAlso I trust you will see your way clear to give a liberal grant per annum towards the Teslin Lake School, even though it be impossible to keep the school open for the full number of teaching days during the year.\n\nI mentioned the above circumstances to the Hon. Frank Oliver, Minister of the Interior, when I met him in Whitehorse, and I showed him your two letters of April 26th, 1909, and Dec.\n13th, 1909. He acknowledged the reasonableness of my claim, and suggested that I should request you to refer the matter to him. I shall be pleased if you will do so.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nI. O. Stringer\n\nBishop of Yukon.\nOttawa, April 28, 1911.\n\nMEMORANDUM:-\nMr. Oliver.\n\nIn June, 1909, His Lordship Bishop Stringer asked for a grant for a school conducted under the auspices of the Church of England at Teslin Lake and after consideration it was decided to allow a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum and $200.00 rental for the building. Returns were received for the years 1908 and 1909. These showed that the school was open 54 days in the two seasons and the grant was paid for the time that it was actually in operation. The return for the past year has just come to hand and it shows that the school was open for 36 days during the months of July and August. According to custom His Lordship would be paid 38/216 of $500.00 and also a similar proportion of the annual rental. Accompanying the return is a communication from His Lordship in which he asks that, in view of the expenditure which was incurred in the erection of a building (over $2000.00) and the fact that Bythell, the Missionary, was engaged during the years 1908 and 1909 in work other than is shown upon the return, the Department allow the full grant for these\nthese two years and further asks that a liberal grant per annum be allowed the Teslin Lake school, even although it is impossible to keep the school open for the full number of teaching days in the year.\n\nHis Lordship states that he brought these circumstances to your attention when he met you at Whitehorse and that you suggested that the matter be referred to you.\n\nIn the past the Department has paid a lump sum of $3000.00 per annum for education in the Yukon. From the 1st instant, however, the boarding school at Carcross will be paid on the per capita basis and it will be necessary to consider the best means of dealing with the day schools, including the one in question, Teslin Lake. A change in the system of paying the grants is called for.\n\nI do not think that the Department would be justified in going back to the years 1908 and 1909 and making further payments, more especially as the additional work referred to by His Lordship is missionary in character and for this the Church is responsible. The grant for the year 1910 is not yet made and should you desire the Bishop may be paid the full allowance as stated in the opening sentence of this\nThe work in the Yukon outside of Carcross is of much the same nature as at Teslin Lake. The Indians are nomadic and it is difficult to provide adequate educational facilities.

This covers the salary of the teacher for the 35 days of 1910, $126.66, the rental of the building for the same length of time, $35.19, and arrears of rent for 54 days for the years 1908-09, $50.00.\n\nThis increased grant will not be allowed for the Teslin school for the year 1911 except under conditions which will be explicitly laid down in a letter in the near future and which will apply to other day schools in the Yukon.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nOttawa, May 30, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nAs Your Lordship has already been advised the Carcross Boarding School was placed on April 1st, last, on a per capita grant basis. It is, therefore, necessary to make some definite arrangements with regard to the conduct of the various day schools in the district. The matter has been given careful consideration by the Department and it has been decided to allow a grant of $720.00 for a teacher's salary and $200.00 rent for a building to a limited number of schools upon condition in each case that a competent teacher is engaged, a suitable building provided and the school kept open a fixed number of days with a minimum average attendance of ten. The number of days that it is considered fair to require school to be in operation in order that any practical benefit may be received by the children is 75 in each school year.\n\nThe building at Moosehide is satisfactory and there should be no trouble in the teachers securing the minimum average attendance above mentioned.\n\nDuring the past season outside of Moosehide day schools were in operation at Whitehorse, Champagne Landing, Selkirk and Teslin. The Teslin return was incomplete and the Selkirk return showed only an average of 3 and the Champagne Landing return an average of only 6.6. If the grant is to be drawn\n\nRight Rev. I. G. Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\ndrawn for these schools Your Lordship will see that it will be necessary not only to increase the number of days attendance but also to considerably increase the average attendance. The attendance at Whitehorse was above the minimum average fixed, but the school was only open 34 days in the year.\n\nThe Department would like to hear from Your Lordship at your earliest convenience in respect to this proposal.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must apologize for the delay in answering your communication of May 30th regarding the Indian Day Schools in Yukon territory. I was in a remote part of the territory at Lambert House when your letter reached Dawson and it awaited my return. Since then I have been travelling almost continuously and could not get at my correspondence. I have only just received yours of August 12th.\n\nIn reply to your proposals to allow a grant of $200 for a teacher's salary and $200 rent for a building to a limited number of Day Schools, I wish to say that I feel the conditions laid down by you are in many cases prohibitive.\n\nIt is impossible in some cases to procure a minimum average of 10, and yet I think, in certain cases, the result justify us in having schools open with a much less average than ten and for a smaller number of School Days in the year than 75. I think you should\nConsider carefully the circumstances and conditions in Yukon Territory. We are endeavoring to do our best to hold day schools for the Indians, and we have no desire to waste the time or our money in unpromising fields, if there are more suitable openings in other parts. The opening of a school for Indians is rather an experiment and we have to stand the cost of such experiments no matter what the result may be and I therefore think your Department could afford to deal liberally with any efforts to educate the Indians under such unfavorable conditions as obtain in the Yukon.\n\nIf the education of the children in our centre is considered to be worthy of a certain support, then the education of a smaller number should be worthy a proportionate amount especially in view of the fact that we, not the Department, have to stand all the initial expenses.\n\nIn the case of Champagne and Selin I have arranged that the teacher shall spend the winter at the former and the summer at the latter place, at our place.\nthe Indians accessible by the river and at the other for the Eskimos only, so that advantage is taken of the only portion of the season when the Indians accessible at these two places respectively.\n\nIf the conditions are not made easier than you suggest it will cut out some of the smaller schools altogether from having next aid and I do not think any one else can do more than we have been doing with the means at our disposal.\n\nI consulted with Mr. J. E. Bragg, Superintendent of Schools for Yukon and he is strongly of the opinion that the conditions should be made more easy and stated that he would be glad to give his views if requested. In Yukon, white schools are assisted when there are six pupils in a place and the average days' attendance may be below that. It is found necessary to be very lenient in the question of white schools and the difficulties are much greater in Indian work.\n\nIf the Department considers it advisable to fix a minimum average attendance and a minimum number of school days in the year, I would suggest five as the minimum attendance and forty as the minimum number of school days in the year. The Church School as a\nDawson, Yukon, Canada\n\nI consider Selkirk as one of our most important schools and yet the average for the quarter ending Dec. 31/10 was only three. This was partly due to the fact that the teacher held School often when only one or two pupils were present while at other times, when the Indians were in, the attendance was fairly good. If pupils are able to attend forty days (about two months) it is much better than nothing at all. Many of the children cannot attend regularly except for a month or two in the year because the families go off hunting and fishing beyond reach of the School. Some children who are able to attend only for a short period are anxious and make as good progress as others who attend for a much longer time.\n\nWe shall try to keep the average both of attendance and of School days as high as possible but I hope your department will be as lenient and generous as possible so that our School work may receive the encouragement necessary to make it more efficient.\n\nWith reference to Whitehorse to Whitehorse for the year 1915, the teacher only\nDIOCESE OF YUKON\n\nRIGHT STRINGER, D.D.\nBISHOP\n\nDawson, Yukon, Canada\n\nBegan his work towards the end of\nthe year and after opening it the\nschool was held regularly with a\ngood attendance and it was continued\ninto the New Year.

The late Minister gave direction that \"unless the attendance is up to a fixed minimum and for a fixed minimum of days the grant will not be continued\". We placed the average attendance at 10 and the number of days at 75. Your original recommendation, however, was more lenient. The phrase that you used was \"where there is a prospect of obtaining a reasonably fair attendance\". I do not feel like recommending restrictions that would close these day schools and, as we are only paying for the work done, I think we should relax. The Bishop recommends the minimum attendance to be 3 and the minimum number of school days in the year 40. If we were to make it any higher than this I think the schools would receive no revenue whatever from the Department and I am, therefore, favourable to accepting the limit set by the Bishop.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 930-1, part 1)\nDecember 22nd, 1926.\n\nMemo for File:\n\nBishop Stringer informs me that the Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing Indian Summer Schools will be fairly regularly conducted.

In going into the matter of the education of the Indian children, it was found that much help could be given to Mr Ball with resultant benefit to the children attending that school.\n\nI beg to respectfully submit a list of material that would come under that head, and would also beg that this be supplied the Teacher as soon as possible, for next year's school work.\n\nIt was noticed that the Black Board was not at all what it should be, and a better one, or even two is really wanted.\n\nDuring a Sunday evening there, whilst torrents of rain fell a service was being conducted, and in passing I happened to glance into the building, and the sight that met my gaze was rather astounding. The roof was leaking, and water came in by streams, yet in spite of that the Indians were at service, and stayed there till the service was finished.\n\nIt is understood that $300-00 was collected last year for the purpose of doing some repairs, and more has been collected since, surely some assistance should be given right away to such a good crowd of Indians as there are in Teslin.\n\nI wish to state that Mr Ball is doing very fine work, and should be helped in every way possible, and if my Office can in any way be of assistance, please command it.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed.\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 930-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nDuring this summer's visit to Teslin Post, Y.T., amongst other matters claiming my attention was that of \"schooling\" for the Indian children.\n\nThe Mission School at this point, was, this year, in charge of Mr. Semple - Bishop Stringer's man, and I found him a most capable, and energetic person with the Indians well-fare at heart.\n\nThe old Church, which also does duty as a day-school was inspected, and it is regretted that no improvements have been done since last year's visit. The youngsters when at school can look through the sides of the building, much to their huge enjoyment. Some roofing has, it is thought, been ordered, but was not seen. The building as it stands is not a decent place to be used as a Church or for a Day-School.\n\nThere is an average of 25 scholars in attendance, and this could be increased were attention given the school.\n\nThere are 4 classes going at the same time, and the more advanced are doing fractions; a sample of a girl's handwriting is herewith enclosed. Of School equipment there is practically nothing; cut-down baking powder cans being used for ink-pots, and many more make shifts were noticed. Slates for the children's use were not in evidence, in fact to summarize the matter, a complete set of school equipment is needed most urgently.\n\nI beg to submit a letter with attached papers thereto, that was directed to Mr. Commissioner Hawksley of Dawson, last summer with regard to this school, and it was hoped by so doing that the supplies would be ready for use, this year.\n\nMr. Semple has done wonders this summer, amongst other things, a play ground has been cleared, swings, etc. have been set up. A presentation set of Base-Ball equipment would be most acceptable to the community, and would be well repaid by free labour given in return.\n\nRespectfully submitted also, are some views taken during the visit, which go to show that these Indians are above the ordinary standard. As Teslin Post is cut off from all roads, it is to their credit that a 6 mile road has been hacked out-beaver-wise, along the edge of the lake, with quite a few bridges over creeks, and over this runs their car.\n\nAlso, these people will not accept \"Rations\" unless the cause is illness, and then the Old Chief has to be first interviewed, which would again go to show that they do deserve all the help that can be afforded, with the education of their children.\n\nAll of which, Sir, is most respectfully submitted with the hope that some assistance may be granted.\n\nI am, Sir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

S. Pragnell, for the Indian Agencies of British Columbia, with your agency visited the Teslin Lake Yukon Terr. English Church Indian Day School, at that point on June 16th 1935, as reported. This Mission was then in charge of Rev Mr Parsons, who is resident, it is understood in Atlin, B.C. and goes over there for the Summer' work.\n\nThis School has been reported upon several times during the past years, and although in the Yukon Terr., serves the many B.C. Indian children who spend their summers at this point, and trap during the winters down the Lake 30 miles, which is in B.C.\n\nThe School deserves every assistance that can be given it, and upon this visit, again it was found short of real necessary supplies. Several times the Department has been good enough to allow this agency to send up School Supplies, but with over 30 odd children, and more coming along, the supplies it receives are quite insufficient.\n\nTherefore may the necessary action be taken to have this excellent school put into such shape that the bright youngsters who attend same may reap a benefit. The worthy Minister is no doubt working at a private loss to his own pocket, for living here is most expensive, and is therefore entitled to some consideration in regard to equipment to carry on his good work- i.e. necessary school supplies.\n\nMay it be humbly suggested that the same sort and amount of supplies that have been granted to the Thaltan mission at this point, be allowed Teslin Lake. The Little Minister at Teslin has only requested the following small odds and ends which are considered not sufficient, or effective.\n\n6. Doz H.B. Penciles 4 Doz Lined Exercise Books.\nAsst Coloured Crayons 2 Boxes White Chalk.\nRubberized sheeting - 10 Yds for black boards. Nibs.\nDried Ink Asst Cols. Illus. Drawing Books. Odd Coloured material- for use of small school children Grade No. 1. Books all kinds also Grade No. 2, and lastly as a favour, some large wall maps of B.C. the Yukon and Canada as a whole. This latter gives the children some idea of Outside Affairs.\n\nAs the season is too far advanced now, it would be possible to have everything fixed up by next Spring so that the equipment if allowed, could go up to Teslin Lake by Taylor & Drury's first boat, and therefore be consigned to that reliable firm in Whitehorse.

It was found that some of the Jennings River band had arrived and the Chief was expected the next day. The R.C.M.P. Detachment was visited, and also the stores. All matters were taken up and dealt with. Fur here was just up to that of last year's catch, and as usual the B.C. Jennings River Indians were better fixed than those of the Yukon. It was then learnt that the R.C.Mission had staked an area at the back of Taylor & Drury's Post and were building a Church thereon\u2014an entirely new venture, and a real penetration into an area considered that of the English Church who, of course, are conducting the Day School on the Indian Reserve, and have in attendance all the children of that district.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., March 6th, 1939\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare and Training  \nIndian Department  \nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby make application, as already mentioned in the past, for two Indian Summer Schools, one to be located at Lower Post, B.C., in the Stikine agency; the other at Ware B.C., in the Stuart's Lake agency. I am assured by the priests in charge in those missions that there plenty enough children of school age to justify the schools. The Ware Indians especially are growing in number and are well deserving people.\n\nI also demand that an undenominational teacher be appointed at Teslin, Yukon, because fully one half of the children of school age have joined or returned to the Catholic Church as they have now a priest visiting them.\n\nHoping that you will find these applications reasonable and just, I am\n\nYours very truly\n\n+ E.M. Bunoz O.M.I.  \nBp.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1939.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant recommending the establishment of seasonal schools at Lower Post, B.C., in the Stikine Agency, and at Ware, B.C., in the Stuart Lake Agency.\n\nOur estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 were prepared in the fall of 1938. No provision was made in them for the expenses that would be necessary if schools were conducted at both these places during the summer of 1939. Under these circumstances favourable consideration cannot be given to your request at the present time.\n\nHowever, I am writing to the Agents concerned requesting them to let me have a report regarding the possibility of conducting seasonal schools at the two places mentioned in your letter and when their replies are received the matter will have further consideration and, in the event of the Department deciding to authorize the schools, provision for the teachers' salaries and other expenses will be made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nWith reference to your request in connection with the Teslin Lake seasonal school I am also writing to the Indian Agent and requesting him to report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nBishop of the Yukon,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nStikine Agency  \nAtlin, B.C., March 12th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a report covering the month of February 1939.\n\nDuring the fore part of this month the R.C. Mission's general affairs came up for reporting upon and same with their school requirements for next summer were duly submitted. Since then letters have been received from His Lordship Bishop Couder, O.M.I. to say that he is flying around to all the Mission points in the month of March, and expects to meet your agent in Atlin about the end of March. It is quite possible that we shall return to Telegraph Creek on the same plane when all matters will be closely taken up with him. They are pushing out their Missions in such a manner that there is a rush way requests will be coming along for further aid with their schools and their various teachers, and it is considered that some idea should be given to the Department as to what they intend to do - or it is done. As instance in point is that of Teslin Lake in the Yukon at which point the better set of Indians come in from the B.C. side of the Provincial Line. Here Bishop Geddis of the English Church has maintained a very fine Day school, to which all the Indian children attended, and to which the Department has allowed much help. To-day the R.C. Missions have taken up some vacant ground around the Trading Post of Messrs Taylor & Drury, and last summer moved Father Drein up from Liard Post and started to build their own Mission. Now the Indians of Teslin Lake have quite a revenue to spend, and being Indians are ever ready to shift their attention to something new, especially if they are made a lot of in so doing. There is no such little \"lamp\" as I have expected at that point in the new future, but of course nothing much can be done about the matter. Most of these Indians did at one time belong to the Russian Faith, and that with the stated fact, that the English Church has had in its keeping, for some years now, quite a sum of money belonging to the Indians that was collected for a new school, or Church, and that same has never been built. The matter is just mentioned for future reference, as going by experience gained on the Yukon River, many years ago; such affairs blow up sometimes into serious matters causing much trouble and expense. However after an interview with Bishop Couder, more information will be gained, which will be submitted in due course.\n\nHarper Reed,  \nIndian Agent.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon,\nJuly 7, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE: SEASONAL INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS; DIOCESE OF YUKON\n\nWe are operating three seasonal schools in Yukon this year, one at Teslin, one at Champagne Landing, and one at Whitehorse.\n\nThe one at Teslin is in charge of Mr. F.M. Gilbert, a student from the Anglican Theological College at Vancouver and who has been very successful in teaching this school during the summers of 1927 and 1928.\n\nThe school at Champagne Landing is in charge of Mr. J.W.

Alexander Anderson, B.A., B.D.. Mr. Anderson was the teacher of the Mooshide Indian Day School in the Yukon from 1925 to 1926.\n\nI trust that you will see your way clear to having the men above mentioned appointed as teachers of their respective schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.A.

Hoey  \nSuperintendent Welfare & Training  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from His Excellency Bishop J.L. Couder of Smithers, B.C., in which he states that there is a rather abnormal condition of affairs at the Teslin Lake Day School. It would appear that the teacher at this school is a Protestant minister. Half the children in attendance are Catholics and the balance are mostly Russian Schismatics.

It is stated that half the children in attendance are Catholics and that on Sundays the teacher, who is a Protestant Minister, insists that all children attend the Protestant services and that he uses moral force with those who are reluctant to do so. Our correspondent further suggests that the only practical method of improving the situation is to establish a school for the Catholic Indian children.\n\nIn your report for the month of February, 1939, you mentioned that it was quite likely that the Department would receive some correspondence regarding Teslin Lake.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate receiving a further report from you and in that communication you should state the number of Catholic children attending the Teslin Lake school, also the number of non-Catholic children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.

Ages given by the older indians are just approximate as most do not know their ages.\n\nRELIGION. The indians of the Teslin District are at present greatly confused by the two Religious Denominations at Teslin. The Church of England has had a summer Mission at Teslin Lake for many years. In the summer of 1938 the Roman Catholics established at Teslin. This has greatly confused the indians and they are not very sure whether or not they are C of E or R.C.'s. When asking the indians on Census Taking as to their Church, such answers as this were received - That they went to both Churches. That they went to the Church that gave them the most work. The older people who had originated in Juneau Alaska, stated that they were of the Russian Catholics.\n\nFuture Census taken of this Band will show that religious Denomination as declared at present, will be much altered.\n\nStikine Indian Agency NOTES.\n\nThe Family of Telegraph JACK and son being Atlin Indians and numbered on that Band were told to move away or else their Trapground holdings might be questioned. Davey Johnson another Atlin Indian was found at Teslin - destitute. As he was and is a trouble indian - he was told to return to his affairs in Atlin. Harper Reed Indian Agent.\nAlso as Fathers Drean and Father Poulett were both in Teslin - having come up from Liard Post, B.C., they were spoken to over the wireless Phone (agent's Diary April 3, 1939). Father Poulett stated he was returning to Liard Post, but Father Drean stated he was remaining at Teslin Lake. At this time the R.C.M.P. Constable was instructed to \"keep out\" of any entanglements that might come about, and be most careful as to \"taking sides\" as to which Church Indians claimed they belonged to.\n\nThis Summer (1939) the long delayed Vaccination of the Teslin Lake Indians was undertaken, which same has been reported upon to the Indian Commissioner in Vancouver B.C. Whilst the vaccination was in progress all other matters were looked into, and school Affairs came in for their attention.\n\nIt was found that a Mr Frank M. Gilbert was in charge of the Day School. Upon looking over his equipment it was found woefully short of everything needed, even down to plain writing paper. Blackboard were missing, in fact it is a wonder how the fellow carried on. He stated that the R.C. Missions were actively engaged in trying to start a school of their own, and talk was going around the camp, which it was hard to control, or even discount. The Indians had been told that their Fathers in times gone by had been of The Russian Faith, and as the R.C. Missions were the same at that, they should return to their own Church.\n\nSubmitted herewith are some views; three small ones showing Bishop Geddes with some of his Indians, and some of which are now claimed back by the R.C. Mission. A view of the New R.C. Building which is part Church and general meeting room. A view of the present school Registrar, which of course contains the names of all the children of the area. As Bishop Geddes was on his way up the Yukon River to this point he was \"wired\" to meet your Agent in Atlin, which latter he kindly did.\n\nThen the Indians were seen and their views obtained, especially the B.C. Band who have consistently backed up the present School. They were found divided, some stated that the Mission that paid the highest \"wages\" for any work done, would get their attendance. In fact the matter was looked on as a \"joke\" in which the Indians would come off best. One family stated that it depends who rings the \"Bell\" first; for they stated, that as soon as we hear that, we drop everything - and \"go\" for when God calls we go no matter where. These people meant what they said also.\n\nConstable Robson (R.C.M.P.) was asked about the situation, and he stated that he had just taken the Census, and had put down what the Indians said they were, but he knew that it was not correct. A list of so-called Indians was obtained signed by Father Drean O.M.I. and is as follows:\n\nJames Fox Baptized 1903 Monica Fox Baptized 1903\nFrank J. Morris - 1906 Louise James Morris -- 1908\nGeo Jack Morris - 1916 Charlie Jack Morris -- 1916\nMinnie Morris - 1916. Also \"The Sidneys Only\" were thought to be baptized some time ago.\n\nFather Drean O.M.I. was called upon, and having had some words with him over Liard Post Matters, in which he was rather too high-handed (The Agness Shorty Case thrown back to LeJack without authority) some time ago, we quite understood each other, and he made no pretence over the matter, and it was understood he was there \"to build up their Church Mission\". He suggested an Industrial School, and was at once informed that, it was a matter entirely in the hands of the Department and that Teslin Lake was a very remote place at present for such an undertaking. He then suggested the Stikine River, between Telegraph Creek and the Coast, and was given the same reply, but that such a situation would be a far better location etc.\n\nSubmitted is a copy of the Census taken by the R.C.M.P. Constab and it is considered that most of those marked R.C., have been induced to say that when asked about the matter.\nSTIKINE AGENCY. TESLIN LAKE ANGLICAN DAY-SCHOOL Contiu 3.\n\nBefore leaving Teslin Lake an informal meeting was held with the B.C. Indians proper. They were told once more to go slow in this matter. That in such affairs the Indian Department has found that such fights only brings along much trouble for the Indians with their families. That today in their camp, several families were half for one Church and half for another, and that always a man and wife should be both the same. They agreed that it was a bad thing, and that they would go slow and talk the matter over good or the final decision to which church they would attend. The constable was once more requested to keep out of this affair as much as possible and that it would be far better for His Indian Agent from Dawson, or the Stikine Indian Agent, to finally hear and settle such a question.\n\nAnd so the matter stood upon leaving Teslin Lake on the 18th of July 1939, as really nothing more could be done. However on the 22nd Bishop Geddes arrived in Atlin on his way to Teslin and a couple of hours was spent in his company. He stated that he had just visited Ottawa, and that some school supplies were promised him, but he would much appreciate the favour if the Department would grant him the list made up by the Teacher. This has been submitted under separate cover.\n\nHe then admitted that a Church-schoolhouse should have been constructed here this, but that he was going over there to start same up. He was told that the Indians generally were at his back, but they wanted a new building, and it was their due. We considered that a list of members should be obtained by him whilst over there, to somewhat settle this affair, and he promised to do this. He was told that Chief Billy Johnson with others had been informed that if they \"Threw away the present school, after all they had received from that point for their children, perhaps they would never be allowed to come back again\". Some paper school supplies that it had been possible to obtain by a passing plane from Telegraph Creek, was given to the Bishop to take over to his school, but their equipment is very low indeed.\n\nIt is regretted that it is nearly impossible to state how many Catholic children; and how many non-Catholic children, are attending this school, for as stated all the children of the community have been in attendance, and as also stated the families are split on the matter. Perhaps it would be as well to allow the matter to brew itself out for a time, and then have a meeting to finally decide who is who.\n\nThis Report has been submitted in all detail, so that a general idea can be arrived at, it is hoped, and which might prevent some further correspondence on the matter, as time and distance to this point is some consideration.\n\nAll of which Sir is most respectfully submitted, and it is hoped will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Anglican Day-school.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 31, in regard to the affairs of the above Day-school; which was received upon my return to this point, after visiting Teslin Lake.\n\nSo that there shall be no misunderstanding as to why the Stikine Indian Agent pays a visit to this point in the Yukon, it is mentioned that the Yukon - B.C. \"Line\" crosses Teslin Lake, west to east, at about 10 mile south of Teslin Lake R.C.M.P. Post. Therefore over 60 persons come up the Lake from the B.C. side of the \"line,\" to trade and reside at the lake, our Reserve at this point. Moreover this crowd of B.C. Indians are the best that live around Teslin Post - so much so that the \"Chief\" Billy Johnson is a B.C. Indian, if such a difference can be used between various parts of this one lake; and the reason why he was so elected by all the Indians at this Post, was for the reason he was thought most capable.\n\nDuring the time that Mr. Hawksley was Indian Agent for the Yukon little attention was given from that point to Teslin Lk., and an understanding came about that the Stikine Agent - having to visit Atlin - should also give attention to Teslin Lake. This was given and even the Day school visited and supplies allowed. Lately, however the R.C.M.P. Authorities have given more attention to Indian Affairs here, and the Stikine Agent's visitations have been more or less confined to his B.C. Indians and their trapping affairs.\n\nUp to this present date, the only school that has been operating at Teslin Lake, has been the Anglican, or Church of England Day School, to which each summer a Teacher is sent up from \"below.\" Enclosed is a photograph of the School Register showing such facts taken on my recent visit, as it was seen some trouble was brewing.\n\nThis is a pure Trapping Area, and all and every Family get out of this Post during the winters and have to do so for a living, therefore it was not common sense to keep a Teacher at this point over the winter months. During summer there is nothing for the youngsters to do but go to school, and this with a supply of school material given to the youngsters to take out into the bush in the Fall - amply meets with the requirements of school education. The youngsters must learn to trap, and this they do whilst out in their camps.\n\nThe following data is submitted in connection with the movement into Teslin Post of the R.C. Mission:\n\nAgent's Diary April 5th 1938 reports he found land staked at Teslin Post on his winter inspection of that area.\n\nSpecial Agent's Report on R.C. Affairs dated July 27th 1938 did not mention Teslin Post, as it is considered \"outside\" real Stikine Agency Affairs.\n\nAgent did not visit Teslin Post summer of 1938, -no time.\n\nWinter of 1936-7 Teslin was not visited, but Constb Robson of that Detachment (R.C.M.P.) did come over to Atlin, was seen (Agent's Diary March 8th 1938) and stated that the R.C.'s were going ahead.\nSir,\n\nRe:- TESLIN LAKE, Y.T. Church of England, School.\n\nI beg to submit a rather non-consequential Report on the known affairs of the above Summer Day School, in connection with the Indian children that attend same, from the Stikine Agency.\n\nThis Yukon Trading Post, to which the Indians of Teslin Lake, trade, was not visited last summer owing to lack of time to do so. The Boundary Line between the Yukon and British Columbia crosses East & West about 15 miles south of this Post, directly across the Lake, and so therefore there is a great mingling of all Indians during the summer months and at the above school all such Indian children attend. Hence again is seen the over-lapping of the Stikine Agency Affairs with that of the Yukon, regarding Indians and their family affairs. It happens that here the better class of Indians are from the B.C. side of the line, and no helper is ever requested from these families.\n\nAs this School is of the English Church Missions, and operating in the Yukon it is really out-side the care or attention of this Agency; but never-the-less when visiting that point, the school is always inspected and such help as can be afforded, offered.\n\nThe last Report on this school from this Agency is dated August 16th 1939, and was of a rather long description as to how matters stood at that point in regard to the starting up of the R.C.M.P. Mission at this Post. Since that time the R.C.M.P. Constable has been changed, and recently no reports have been received from that Detachment. It is expected that everything is going along correctly, otherwise some letters would have been received ere now.\n\nDuring the expected Inspection of this Agency, next Summer by Mr Inspector Coleman of Vancouver B.C., it is hoped to pay this School a visit, and look into the welfare of our Indians at that location.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Andrew's Mission,\nFort Selkirk, Y.T.,\nMarch 7, 1941.\n\nHarper Reed Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAtlin, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of February 22nd, received today. I am sorry that my letter did not reach you sooner but I was unaware of your temporary residence in Atlin.\n\nThe school supplies for the Teslin Lake School were possibly dispatched in 1939 for Mr. Frank Gilbert made out the requisition form. I opened the shipment and used them last year.\n\nWhile in Teslin I received no correspondence nor saw any on file suggesting that a signed list should be made out by those who wished their children to attend the school. I would have most certainly complied with such a request for all the parents were eager that their children receive schooling during the short summer months.\n\nLast year Teslin was not the pleasant gathering place of friends which it used to be back in 1934. Suspicion and ill-feeling have been engendered among the natives so that families have been separated in a subtle way. I had hoped to have seen you in Teslin last summer for only by actual visitation could you sense the change in the communal atmosphere. I do hope that there will be a representative of the Church of England in Canada at Teslin when you and Inspector Coleman make your visit in the spring.\n\nEnclosed is a list of the school children I taught last summer. There were thirty-four pupils on the register with an average attendance of 25.4 which is very good considering that the whole group was not in Teslin all the time. Some of the older boys also occasionally attended classes but were not put down in the book.\n\nThanking you for your appreciated kindness in the past\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.Robt.C.W.Ward,\n(Missionary and Teacher at Teslin 1934 and 1940)\nChurch of England in Canada.\nLIST OF SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO ATTENDED\n\nTEELIN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (C. of E.)

Ward\nMissionary Teacher\nSir,\n\nRe:- TESLIN LAKE, Y.T. - Church of England School.\n\nOnce again it is found necessary to bring the above matter to the notice of the Department for their further consideration and advice. In this regard it is respectfully requested that a letter on this subject, dated August 16, 1939, be used as a reference. In this letter is mentioned Father Dreen, once an Liard Post, and his connection with the return of an Indian girl at that point, from the Lejock school. Agness Sherry - who caused all the trouble we have since experienced from the Bronson TOM case recently. It is mentioned as Father Dreen is over progressive, and more mixed affairs may be expected from this quarter.\n\nSubmitted herewith is a letter received from Rev. Robt C.W. Ward, Missionary and Teacher at Teslin Lake for the above School. Also is attached a Requisition for some small school supplies, which same is thoroughly endorsed as necessary by this Office, on behalf of our B.C. Indian Children attending that school.\n\nIt will be seen that matters have not improved at all - which is exactly as expected, but which it seems cannot be avoided. However it is high time now to hold an investigation and somewhat settle the affair. Inspector Coleman on his visitation to this point could look into the matter and no doubt arrive at some arrangement. This would work in together with the proposed separation of the B.C. Indians from those of the Yukon proper.\n\nThe crux of the matter is, that the R.C. Missions are intending to establish their Mission at Teslin, and are practically using conjurement to establish their aims. They have in fact already accomplished much; Father Dreen is very clever.\n\nIt is considered that the above school, after all the years it has operated, under every friendly condition with all the Indian families of that location - should receive every consideration possible.\n\nIn the consideration of this subject, it might be borne in mind that to further advance the affairs of the R.C. Mission, those Authorities have requested a Boarding School on Tagish Lake, and not least a proposed WINTER (Bush) school at Johnston Town at the south end of Teslin Lake, which would take in all the B.C. Indians that live there; and who are at present the strongest supporters of the above Church of England School (summer).\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

It is noted that Inspector Coleman will visit this point during the coming summer and following his visit he will no doubt report to the Department.\n\nMay I point out that this Branch does not interfere with the activities of the missionaries of any of the Churches engaged in Indian work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A. Jeckell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1941.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a return showing that the Teslin Lake School was open for a period of 53 days during the summer of 1941. The return is signed by Rev. Robt. C.W. Ward. This is the first intimation that we have received that it was intended to operate this school during the past summer. As a matter of fact the last return received for this school was for the quarter ended September 30, 1939.\n\nWhile the names of 22 children are shown on the return this number includes 1 pupil of 18 years of age who attended 9 days. The average attendance for the period the school was open was only 11. Do you consider it advisable to operate this school at the present time when conditions are so difficult? On whose authority did Mr. Ward re-open the school this past summer?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W.A. Geddes,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon\nMarch 3, 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe. Teslin Lake School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of Nov. 6th 1941 concerning the above School, I should like to point out that our Church has operated this school as a seasonal Day School for a considerable number of years. Early in 1940 you informed me that no grant would be available for that School during the current year. We operated the School however without expecting a grant, and forwarded the return in the usual course. The return was sent back to us with the statement that no grant was available.\n\nI find it difficult to understand the question in the last paragraph of your letter regarding the advisability of operating this School at the present time, in view of the fact that, if my information is correct, your Department has this year agreed to recognize a Roman Catholic Day School at Teslin Lake at least to the extent of agreeing to furnish them with School Supplies. I should also like to point out that as late as 1934 the Census returns of your Department list all the Indians at Teslin Lake as members of the Anglican Church. It does seem strange that you should question the advisability of the Anglican Church continuing a Day School that has been established for many years, and at a post that until very recently listed all the Indians as Anglicans, and at the same time agree to recognize, as soon as it is established, at that same post the school of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nInasmuch as this School has operated continuously for many years past as a seasonal day school, no question of its re-opening arises at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon\nMonthly Reports\n\nStikine Indian Agency - July, 1942.\n\nTeslin Lake.\n\nHere there are two privately operated schools, one Anglican and the other Roman Catholic. The attendance appears to be fairly good at both and good work is being done, particularly in the Anglican school which has operated for several years now. The attendance at both schools is made up from Indians of both this Agency and the Yukon Territory. The teachers in both schools are clerics, neither of whom is paid by the Department for their services which incidentally is a departure from the procedure in small seasonal schools operated by the Agency. The quality of the tuition does not appear to be inferior to that in schools of this Agency either. Teslin Post, where the schools are operated is in the Yukon Territory and it is understood that a few supplies are obtained through the Indian Agent at Dawson, Y.T. More details concerning these schools will be given in a separate report covering the school situation at Teslin Post, to be submitted shortly. No regular day school reports are being submitted for these schools as they are private and in the Yukon Territory.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent.\nExtract from Dr. McGill's letter of November 21, 1942, addressed to Rt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, D.D., Bishop of Yukon, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI am disposed to think that some misunderstanding has arisen in respect to the operation of seasonal schools in the Yukon Territory. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the grants usually made to these schools have been withdrawn at any time. In the estimates of this year I note that provision has been made for the operation of the following schools: Champagne Landing, Old Crow Village, Rampart House, Teslin Lake and Whitehorse, in addition to the two more or less regular schools at Moosehide and Selkirk. The total amount set apart for the operation of these schools is $3,790.\n\nExtract from reply dated December 17, 1942, received from Bishop Geddes.\n\nI am a little concerned about the first paragraph in your letter regarding grants for the Seasonal Day Schools operated by our Church at Teslin, Champagne and Whitehorse. These three schools have been operated by our Church during the past three summers but we have been unable to receive the grants from your Department that formerly were paid. In fact in 1940 when the return for the Teslin Day School was forwarded to Ottawa it was returned with the notification that no grant would be paid. I gather from your letter that the funds for these schools are in the estimates that have been approved by Parliament and I shall be grateful if you can advise me as to how we can secure the grants for these schools that we have been operating.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo which refers to the Teslin Lake Seasonal School, I find that we have received a return from Mr. Ward showing that the school was in operation from July 1 to September 25, 1942, a period of 56 days, at the rate of $3.00 a teaching day, plus bonus. We have issued a cheque for $192.96 which has been sent to Mr. A. Coldrick, Financial Secretary of the Diocese of Yukon, Dawson, Y.T. I enclose forms which the teacher should also complete and send to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSt. Philip's Mission,\nTeslin, Y.T.\nOctober 18th, 1943.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find the Quarterly School returns for the months of April and May. Due to a change-over of missionaries here the forms were not sent to you as before.\n\nAt the end of the quarter Mr. Webber was very busy nursing the sick Indians and soon afterwards he left for Dawson. Returning now for a few days I have been checking up -- hence this belated return.\n\nMrs. A. Cowaret, from Fort Selkirk, is now teaching school here and she will forward the December return.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"Rev. Robert C.W. Ward\"\nDawson, Y.T.,\n\nNovember 16th, 1943.\n\nRe: Teslin Day School Quarterly Return.\n\nI have just received a return from Rev. R.C.W. Ward of St. Philip's Mission, Teslin. It actually should cover the quarter ending June 30th, 1943, but the period to which it applies expired May 21st, 1943.\n\nI enclose copy of explanatory letter received from Mr. Ward. Mr. Webber who is mentioned in this letter is now at Fort Selkirk, and I am contacting Bishop Geddes with a view to obtaining a more complete report. In the meantime it would appear that I can hardly certify the enclosed return.\n\nJ.M.

Day School was open in the June quarter of 1943.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. A. Cowaret began duties at this school on October 18. In the past we have been allowing payment at the rate of $3.00 a teaching day. It will be necessary for her to complete both T.D. 1 forms and Head of Household Bonus forms, as well as a staff questionnaire. All these forms are enclosed and you should have her complete them and return same to this office.\n\nR.A.

In this general connection may I refer to my letter of even date dealing with the Reverend Mr. Stringer.\n\nAs regards Mrs. A. Cowaret, the only actual intimation I had as to her engagement as teacher came from Reverend Mr. Ward's letter of October 18th, copy of which was sent you with my letter of November 15th. You state that Mrs. Cowaret began her duties on October 18th. I have no information as to this.\n\nYou suggest that forms should be completed by Mrs. Cowaret and I am sending them on to Teslin by mail asking that they be returned direct to you.\n\nJ.E.

There was a note on this return stating that Mrs. A. Cowaret re-opened the school on October 18, 1943. I wrote to Indian Agent Gibben in regard to the matter and he has just replied stating that he had not received any information from you regarding Mrs. Cowaret's appointment.\n\nIt has been the usual practice to only conduct this school during the summer, and the Department is at a loss to understand why Mrs. Cowaret apparently re-opened the school on October 18. Under the circumstances, I would appreciate very much receiving a letter from Your Lordship, explaining the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. W.

The latter communication intimated that the Anglican Day School at Teslin was not functioning during the winter.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Bishop Geddes asking that the Department approve of the appointment of Mr. G.

Salary will be allowed him at the same rate as formerly, namely, $2.00 a teaching day.\n\nI enclose a supply of report forms which Mr. Wyatt should complete and return when the seasonal school commences. On receipt of these returns, payment of the amount due him for salary will be made.\n\nI also enclose T.D.IA form and staff questionnaire.

We have just been advised by our Indian Superintendent at Fort Norman that Mrs. Miller, the teacher at McPherson, is resigning at Easter. As this school has been a great success, Mr. Hunter has suggested that every effort be made to replace Mrs. Miller.\n\nThe other teacher whom we have in mind for this school is Mr. Evans who formerly taught near Moose Factory, James Bay. He has just accepted a position at Chassawawin, in northern Manitoba. I wrote recently to the Bishop of Brandon and asked if we could be definitely informed as to whether Mr. Evans still wishes to go into the Yukon as he originally requested. I will write you further when I hear definitely about Mr. Evans' plans. He has a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Alberta and is particularly anxious to teach in the Yukon or Northwest Territories.

Meek,\nIndian Agent,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\n\nDear Mr. Meek:\n\nOn my return from Victoria I received a letter from Mr. Gibben, authorizing the opening of a school at Teslin, with the proviso that there would be an assured regular attendance of seven white pupils, and that a satisfactory building be provided for a school. I assume that the latter is being furnished by your Department.\n\nI may be censured for going ahead with the establishment of the school, but in any case I have offered the appointment as teacher at Teslin to Miss Joah Adams, whom you have met, no doubt, in Whitehorse. I have also ordered blackboards and all necessary supplies for the school, except desks. These supplies are being shipped to the teacher, c/o you, on the Princess Norah, leaving Vancouver August 28.\n\nIt seemed to me that something had to be done at once, although I was in doubt whether the requisite number of white pupils would be on hand. Forgive me if I place that responsibility on you. I know there are a number of half-breed children who would attend Teslin school if it were opened; besides, the Indian children there would give us an enrollment similar to that in other schools on the Highway.\n\nTwo months ago we ordered 75 desks for use in new schools or at Whitehorse. Mr. Warwick can inform you whether these are available. I am afraid that he cannot supply desks, as he had no reserve on hand when I was there in July. If desks are not on hand, possibly some could be borrowed from church schools.\n\nI believe you will approve the action I have taken, and I know that you will do what you can to help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(signed) R. Huland,\nSuperintendent of schools.\n\nP.S. I expect to visit Teslin between Sept. 9 and 12. I asked Miss Adams to open school on or after Sept. 7.\n\nR.H.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nReference Teslin joint Day School, and my telegram of 31st ultimo and your reply today's date. This subject was first reported on in my letter of November 17, 1948, on which date I also sent you a telegram suggesting a day school for Teslin. There are not enough Indian children to warrant a day school, and neither are there quite enough white children at the present time to justify a full time teacher of the Yukon Territorial Government.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the Yukon Territorial Council at Dawson recently, an appropriation of $2,700.00 for a teacher's salary, and $100.00 for classroom supplies, was passed for Teslin. There are several day schools along the Alaska Highway, mainly for the benefit of road maintenance crews, and in at least one of these schools, Indians are being taught. These schools are paid for by the Yukon Government, with the Canadian Army furnishing schoolroom and teacherage. Mr. Huland no doubt thought that a similar arrangement could be effected with Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI plan to proceed with Mr. Huland and Miss Adams to Teslin on Thursday, Sept. 9th, when the school will be officially opened. The Anglican and Church of England seasonal schools have both very kindly offered to assist by lending any equipment needed until the Territorial School system can furnish same. This Branch has been asked to obtain and maintain school building and teacherage.\n\nI shall take up your suggestion of purchase of house-store for school and teacherage with Mr. Huland. The teacherage is in excellent condition, store is suitable for school but needs lining on the inside. Rental of $25.00 for these two buildings considered extremely reasonable for the Yukon. It is very difficult to estimate number of white and Indian children likely to remain during the winter; but a further report will be submitted when more facts are known.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSupt. Indian Agency\nColonel Neary:\n\nTeslin Day School:\nThis now requires a new file as it has become a predominantly territorial non-denominational school.\n\nMiss Adams is in the service of the Yukon Territorial Council \u2014 for how long I cannot say but if it depends on the regular attendance of seven non-Indians then we would be well advised not to purchase or lease that store. A monthly arrangement is likely to suffice, and will prevent our tenancy of an empty building.\n\nEven timing the school should be deferred until its prospects of functioning are clearer than they are now.\n\nThe equipment which we can lend from nearby season schools may not be needed long in this combined school.\n\nI would suppose Mr. Holland is confident that he can maintain the attendance. These pupils are going to cost at least $300 each per annum before we (and I feel it is I.R.) start buying wood.\n\nIf Mr. Controller Gibbon cuts off financial assistance we could scarcely retain Miss Adams there unless we are prepared to subsidize parents who would otherwise be miles away.\n\nThe denominational school pattern is not favored in the Yukon and Mr. Musk has not had to give much attention to denominational activities. This are, however, becoming more obvious and they could blight this combined project before it gets well started.\n\nThe money might have been better used if they sent the few children concerned to Lee's school.\n\nC.A.T.

Whenever possible, the teacher's residence should be in a building separate from the school building.\n\nThe Territorial Government agrees to pay the teacher's salary, to furnish desks and classroom supplies, including blackboards.\n\nThe system has worked very well during the past three years, when we first opened the Highway schools.\n\nMr. Gibben, Controller, Yukon Territory, has intimated that the Department of Indian Affairs agrees to work on the same basis as the Canadian Army in the operation of the school at Teslin.\n\nWe feel fortunate in securing the services of Miss Joan Adams, a very superior type of teacher, at Teslin School. We can assure you that she will have the full support of the Territorial Government at all times. We feel sure that the Department of Indian Affairs will co-operate in like manner.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. Hulland,\nSuperintendent of Schools.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nOctober 16, 1948.\n\nReference the opening of a joint Territorial Government-Indian Affairs day school at Teslin, Y.T. On September 10th I proceeded to Teslin with R. Holland, Yukon School Inspector, and Miss Joan Adams, school teacher. Arrangements were made to make alterations to rented house for use as a school room. It is suitable for the purpose. Permission was obtained from Indian Health Services for Miss Adams to live temporarily at the nursing station at Teslin. There is no Public Health Nurse now working along the Alaska Highway.\n\nSupplies have now come forward to Miss Adams. My latest information is that nine children are attending. Proportion of whites and Indians not known. It is possible that more Indians would attend if there was any place for them to stay at Teslin. The entire community is nomadic, living in well-built log cabins during the summer and, with the exception of three or four elderly people, moving out to their trap-lines in the winter.\n\nFuel for school has been ordered, accounts will be submitted later. The school is equipped with electric lights supplied by the R.C.I.F. Report of Mr. Holland, dated 4th instant, is attached hereto.\n\nP.J. Meek\n\n(Signed)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nOctober 28, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DIRECTOR,\n\nTeslin Combined School\n\nThere are a number of Indian children living at Teslin, Y.T., for whom we are not providing educational facilities. Many of these children are Anglicans and will not be able to attend the projected Teslin Residential School.\n\nPlease find attached a letter from the Superintendent of Schools for the Yukon Territory, outlining an agreement for the operation of a joint school.\n\nI would recommend that we provide the school building, fuel and light as well as accommodation for the teacher. You will note that the Department of National Defence has entered into similar agreements with the Yukon Territorial Council in such instances. The school actually is in operation in a rented building. The teacher is well qualified and holds a B.C. certificate. I would recommend that I be authorized to write to Mr. Hulland, accepting the terms of the agreement outlined in his attached letter of October 4.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 18, 1948.\n\nR.J. Meek, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nRe: Teslin Lake Combined School\n\nUnfortunately your letter of October 16 arrived when I was absent from the office inspecting schools in Western Canada.\n\nHowever, I have had an opportunity to discuss both your letter and that of Mr. Hulland with our Acting Director. He has agreed to the operation of a joint school at Teslin Lake and in accepting the terms of the agreement outlined in Mr. Hulland's letter of October 4.\n\nI understand that you have arranged for a rented house for use as a schoolroom and that you have obtained permission from Indian Health Services for Miss Adams, the teacher, to live temporarily at the nursing station at Teslin.\n\nI note that you have sent the supplies to Miss Adams and that the school is progressing favourably. Under separate cover I am arranging to send to Miss Adams a copy of our monthly report forms. This should be submitted by her monthly through your office to indicate the number of Indian children in attendance at this school. We will in this way be able to check on the number of children and their attendance.\nWe are aware of Miss Adams' qualifications and feel that this school should be quite successful. Would you please advise Mr. Hulland that we agree to the terms of his letter of October 4 and assure him that our Department will cooperate in every way in the operation of this school.\n\nIt is presumed that it will be unnecessary to erect a building or buildings for this school for some years to come. Have you considered the operation of this school during the summer holidays when the Indians are mainly in residence there?\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference Church of England Summer School, Teslin, Y.T. The Rev. R.J. Gordon is now resident at Teslin for the summer. He informs me that there would be a maximum of only six Indian children likely to attend his school. The reason is that some of the children who would have attended in previous years are now pupils of the Teslin Joint School and have attended regular classes under our present Day School teacher, Miss J. Adams. There are also a few other children who are applying for admission to Carcross Residential School for the coming term. The Rev. Gordon does not consider it worthwhile to hold school for such a small class.\n\nI would therefore recommend that Teslin Church of England seasonal school be closed for this summer.\n\nRev. Gordon has offered to teach handicrafts in which he has had some training. This would be for both children and adults of Teslin Indian Reserve. I have requested Rev. Gordon to submit a requisition for handcraft material and will forward to you on receipt of same.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nJune 25, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nTeslin Lake Indian Day School\nRef. your 166 of June 17, 1949\n\nWe appreciate that it would not be practical to operate the Teslin Seasonal School in view of the fact that we are now cooperating with the Yukon Territory in the operation of a joint school at this point.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you concerning the handicraft programme.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, July 22, 1949.\n\nThe Right Reverend Arthur H. Sovereign, S.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca,\nSynod Office,\nPeace River, Alberta.\n\nMy dear Bishop Sovereign:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of July 12 concerning the proposed erection of an Indian Residential School at Teslin, Y.T.\n\nWhile tenders have been called for the erection of this building, no decision has as yet been reached with respect to the awarding of a contract. You can rest assured that the Department does not propose to spend seven hundred thousand dollars or anything approaching such an amount for the erection of this school.\n\nWe are quite aware of the work that has been done by your Church in the Southern Yukon. The 1944 census of the Indians in Canada shows that there are some 307 Indians of the Roman Catholic faith in the Yukon. These are mainly situated at Burwash Landing, Kelly Lake, Frances Lake, Watson Lake and Teslin. In addition to the children of these Indians, we had of course planned to provide for the children of the northeast corner of British Columbia. There are some 450 Catholic Indians in this region, including 96 in the Atlin-Teslin area, 75 at Nelson Creek, 42 in the Liard-Frances Lake area, 60 in the Nelson River district and 184 at Tahltan. There are also Indian children in the Peace River district down the Alaska highway as far as Prophet River, who require institutional care.\nBefore a decision was reached to erect this school, two separate educational surveys were carried out. Both were in agreement that such an institution was necessary.\n\nWith regard to the Teslin Bay School, our records show that for many years we have paid an amount towards the salary of your seasonal school teacher, usually a theological student. We have also sent in school supplies. Only in 1933 were we unable to make such payments. For many years these teachers were nominated by the late Bishop Geddes. A joint school is now being operated at Teslin in co-operation with the Yukon Territorial Council. The teacher, Miss Joan Adams, is an Anglican.\n\nWe are aware of the condition of the buildings at the Whitefish Lake Church of England Residential School and in a recent letter to Archbishop Kingston I mentioned that we had assured your officials that we were prepared to erect a day school for the Anglican children at this point. I presume from your letter that your recommendation is for the erection of another residential school there.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 930-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTraining\n\nI am pleased to say the Joint School at Teslin is an outstanding success and the Yukon Territorial Government is anxious to continue operations. Superintendent of Schools, R. Holland, included a splendid tribute to the teacher, Miss J. Adams, in his annual report. He concludes with the following:\n\n\"The school at Teslin is unique in that it is the only school in Yukon Territory where both white and Indian children are in attendance. I am convinced that the Department of Indian Affairs will realize the necessity of improving facilities for pupils and the teacher.\"\n\nThis suggestion has been acted upon and correspondence is under way concerning a new school building and teaching staff.\n\nA sports meeting was held at Carcross under the direction of Clerk H.J. MacDonald, on June 10th, when all pupils of Whitehorse and Carcross Indian Schools and Teslin Joint School attended. Each contest was enthusiastically fought for and Carcross emerged the winner, being donated the Taylor and Drury Cup by Mr. W.L. Drury. This cup is for annual competition.\n\nSome excellent films were shown to the Indian schools of Southern Yukon by R.C.M.P. during the quarter. While it may be unfair to single out a particular person, I would like to draw attention to the outstanding interest and sympathetic manner in which Const. B.E. Harrison, Reg. No. 13800, Whitehorse Sub-Division, R.C.M.P., has co-operated with this office in handling, amongst other things, athletic meets and film showings.\n\nAs shown in my report for Quarter ending September 30th, 1943, Fort Selkirk School, though officially closed, continued under Church of England auspices, teaching for 63 days during the present quarter with an average daily attendance of 5.36.\n\nA teacher has not yet been nominated for Old Crow and I am afraid the season is getting very late. Due to tough conditions there, the post demands a teacher (preferably a married couple) of outstanding qualities. It is one place I am anxious to see with a school.\n\nI spent a day or two at Vancouver in company with Mr. R.F. Devey, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C. Mr. Devey was most considerate and helpful regarding some of our problems. If and when he next visits Stikine Agency he has kindly agreed to make a courtesy inspection of some of our more accessible schools. I have wondered if a working arrangement could be made with Mr. Holland, Yukon Territory School Superintendent to give a complete annual inspection to Indian Affairs schools in the Yukon while on Territorial inspections.\nProposed new buildings for Teslin (Joint) Day School:\n\nMr. Supt. Meek has not been able to fix a firm figure for this project which he is suggesting be included in the 1950-51 estimates. Consideration has been given to the structures and costs at Bighorn and Alexis. Possibly the best approximation will be arrived at by studying Mr. Supt. Knapp's estimate for the building project at Upper Hay River, which is a modification of Alexis. Requisitions from Mr. Knapp are being processed now. His letter of November 7 deals with such matters as trucking and storage which also will arise at Teslin.\n\nNo doubt the interest of Yukon Territory at this point will increase with the growing non-Indian population of religious denominations other than Roman Catholic, but the disposal of Indian pupils at this point remains to be seen after projected construction of accommodation to be conducted under denominational auspices is in operation.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Calgary.\n\nSuperintendent, Yukon Agency.\n\nC.A.F.

Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nTeslin Joint School.\n\nI note that you have not been able to fix a firm figure for this project for the 1950-51 Estimates. Now that the residential school will not be built at Teslin but at Lower Post, I have been giving some thought to the disposal of the lumber which you so carefully had piled at the proposed site near Teslin Lake. Naturally, we would wish to use this lumber and it might be possible for you to use some of it in building plan 838.\n\nUnder separate cover I am sending you the bill of materials and the plan for this school and I believe that it would suit our requirements at Teslin.\n\nFrom the bill of materials you will be able to decide what additional requirements will be needed in order to build this type of school. If the materials are supplied by the Department, then we should recommend construction by day labour with a foreman-carpenter being hired at an hourly rate.\n\nBernard F.

Clark, Esq.,\nEducational Supervisor,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nc/o Mr. Gooderan,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nJust received your note about the Teslin stock pile of lumber, etc. I examine it every few months, nothing is missing, but it is certainly not improving with exposure. I do not think the donnaconna could be used for new structures, but would be excellent for insulating purposes.\n\nThe Donnaconna for the Mayo School was requisitioned for from the Vancouver office, and is now in the freight sheds here, waiting for the opening of navigation next year.\n\nThe two large cook stoves are beginning to rust badly. I have written several letters about the remaining structures at Teslin, which you may remember looking over with Mr. Porsild. It doesn't appear they will ever be used, and the man who originally purchased the campsite from War Assets would like to acquire them.\n\nI wish your stay had been longer. I was learning a lot.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(R.J. Meek)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 930-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nTeslin Joint School\n\nReference your letter of 16th ultimo, file 930-1 (E). I am pleased to report that the lumber and building material which was piled on the site of the proposed residential school now being built at Lower Post is readily available and in good condition. I have inspected the pile at every opportunity during the past summer. The Lomacoma has deteriorated slightly but will make excellent insulation for walls.\n\nI have received building plan 888 and bill of materials. It would, indeed, make an excellent school and teacherage. Through Mr. Gooderham I have received copy of bill of materials and sketches of log building used as school at Upper Hay River. The teacherage is similar. A log building would certainly represent a saving to the Department, as well as giving employment to Indians; it would also be characteristic of the general tone of the village of Teslin.\n\nThe common method of utilizing logs for large structures in the Yukon is to saw or 'square' the logs on three sides, the rounded side, of course, being to the outside. I am wondering if this method of log construction could be used with Plan 888. Every builder and carpenter I have spoken to advise against the use of asbestos or hard-surface shingles for either walls or roof.\n\nJ.J. Meek\nSuperintendent\nIndian agency.\nJanuary 6, 1950.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nTeslin Joint School\n\nReference your letter of Dec. 27\n\nThe log schools which we have been building in Alberta are proving quite satisfactory and while we do follow Plan 338 for the classroom, we provide a separate teacherage. If you wish further details on this type of school, I would recommend that you write to Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson at Edmonton as he has had considerable experience in erecting these buildings.\n\nWe could send you an accountable advance for the logs which would be required for both the school and the teacherage and these could be cut now so that they will be ready for use next summer.\n\nI believe it would be quite acceptable to have the logs squared as is common practice in the Yukon. With regard to asbestos shingles, these were only a wartime acceptance and we are now using cedar siding for the exteriors of our schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nTealin Joint School\n\nI am writing today to Mr. Indian Superintendent Meek concerning the Jule children, now attending the Tealin Joint School.

If Mr. Jule wishes to have his children continue to attend the Tealin Joint School, you should secure from him an affidavit certifying that he wishes his children continue to attend this school.\n\nBernard F.

Drean, O.M.I.,\nTESLIN, Y.T.\n\nRev Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 21st regarding suspension of Family Allowances to Effie and Kitty Jule. This was done pursuant to the Family Allowances Act which states that if a child is absent for more than five days without reasonable excuse, Family Allowances must be suspended. Miss Clancy tells me she warned the children who were absent concerning this. We had no alternative but to suspend Allowances. I might add that we were instructed on this policy by C.A.F. Clark who visited here some two months ago.\n\nThe Teslin School is known as a Joint School, and is not conducted under religious auspices, but directly under the supervision of the Territorial Government. Indian Affairs provide the school and teacherage and certain classroom material. It is designed to accommodate Indians and whites who are resident in Teslin.\n\nMy understanding of Summer or Seasonal Schools is that they are for children who cannot attend day school by reason of being with their parents on the trap-line. They are, as you point out, entirely under religious supervision. A much greater latitude is given to these schools for obvious reasons. The Indian Act does not state that they are obliged to attend Summer School when they have already attended Lay School. However, as you have written to Col. Neary I feel he will issue a ruling on this matter for future guidance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nTeslin Joint School\n\nAs you are aware, the above school is for Indian and white children of Teslin. In addition there is a Roman Catholic Seasonal School for those children unable to attend the Joint School through absence on trap-lines.\n\nThe Monthly Attendance Report for November showed the attendance of Effie and Kitty Jule, and Peter Sydney as being unsatisfactory and without reasonable excuse. I visited Teslin on December 9th and explained the requirements of the Family Allowances Act to the parents of the children. Results did not improve and this office recommended to Director of Family Allowances, suspension of payments to the two families concerned.\n\nI received a letter from Fr. Dream O.M.I. on Dec. 27th, stating that, as the Jule girls were Roman Catholic, they must attend the Roman Catholic summer school. I replied to him the same date as per copy attached.\n\nMiss Clancy, teacher at Teslin, now advises that the Jule family still remain away from school. She states: \"The Jules have not returned to school since Christmas. I have heard that they consider Father Dream's summer school to be sufficient for their educational needs, so they are quitting this school. Is there any way you could stop Father Dream from holding this school? The Jules are quite clever youngsters but it is difficult to teach them when they come so irregularly.\"\n\nWill you please advise regarding the matter of attending seasonal school and day school, and if my interpretation of the Family Allowance Act is correct.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\n8 February, 1950.\n\nMr. R. J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y. T.\n\nTeslin Joint School\n\nReference your No. 166 of January 25\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter written to the various denominations by Dr. D. C. Scott in October, 1922.\n\nYou will recall that I referred to this ruling in my previous letter of January 20.\n\nYou can also appreciate, therefore, the need for a short affidavit, taken in your presence, and relating to the wishes of the father with regard to attendance at both day and residential schools.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nTeslin Lake, February 28, 1950.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nRe: Effie and Kitty Jule (?)\n\nI write once more about the \"Jule\" children. Charlie does not want to sign an \"affidavit\" to send his children at the \"Joint School of Teslin\". On the contrary, he has taken his children away from school altogether. He sent them there in the Fall because they threatened to cut off the \"Family Allowance\" if he did not do so. They stayed away from school a few days in December and their \"Family Allowance\" was cut off.\n\nAgent,\n\nMr. R. Heary wrote to the Indian/Mr. Week. The latter does not seem to want to understand anything...He has just given the order to the Taylor and Drury store to give the Jule family only $21.00 a month of goods instead of $35, beginning on March 1st.\n\nHere is an extract of his letter:\n\"the monthly credit to this account (Jule's account) you will recall was $35.00...The Regional Director of Family Allowances, Ottawa has suspended this account January 1950 to collect an overpayment to this account due to the unsatisfactory attendance of Effie and Kitty Jule - Allowance will revert to $21.00 per month March 1950 for the remainder of the Jule Children.\"\n\nThis letter was addressed to the Manager of the Taylor and Drury store and was dated February 15.\n\nI trust this letter will open the eyes of the Indian Department on the unwillingness of our Indian Agent.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Week, the Indian Agent, wrote to another person in order to obtain an opposite decision to that given by Mr. Heary. I do not know if there was a reply. This is, dear Father, the situation. Please do what you can as soon as possible.\n\nAwaiting a reply from you, I remain,\n\nYour brother,\n(Signed) Albert Drean, O.M.I.\n\nTranslation,\nYB/CL\n27-2-50\nTeshin Lake - Feb. 28 - 1850.\n\nBien Cher P\u00e8re Plouffe,\n\nRe: Effie and Kitty Jule.\n\nC'est encore au sujet des enfants \"Jule\" que je vous \u00e9cris. Charlie Jule ne veut certainement pas signer un \"affidavit\" certifiant qu'il veut envoyer ses enfants \u00e0 la Joint School de Teshin. Au contraire, il a retir\u00e9 ses enfants de l'\u00e9cole enti\u00e8rement. Il les enverra \u00e0 l'automne parce qu'on le mena\u00e7a de leur enlever sa \"family allowance\" s'il ne le faisait pas. Ils ont manqu\u00e9 quelques jours en d\u00e9cembre et leur \"family allowance\" a \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9e.\n\nMonsieur B. Henry a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'agent Indien Monseigneur Week. Ce dernier ne semblait vouloir rien entendre... Il vient de donner l'ordre au \"magasin\" de \"Taylor and Dury\", de donner \u00e0 la famille Jule seulement $21.00 dollars par mois au lieu de $35.00 \u00e0 partir du 1er mars.\n\nVoici un extrait de sa lettre :\n\n\"The monthly credit to this account (Jule's account) you will recall was $35.00...\"\nRegional Director of Family Allowances, Ottawa,\nhas suspended this account January 1950 to\ncollect an overpayment to this account due to\nthe unsatisfactory attendance of Effie and Kitty\nJule.

Dr\u00e9an, O.M.I., of Teslin, Yukon, regarding the way your Agent Mr. Meek is treating some families in the matter of Family Allowances. It would seem that he has refused to obey orders received from Ottawa.\n\nYou may want to write to him once more regarding this matter as the Indians of Teslin who have refused to send their children to the Joint School of Teslin are within their rights and they should not be deprived of Family Allowances on that account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nN.B. Would you kindly return the attached letter.\nAIR MAIL\n\nMarch 14th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nRe: Teslin Lake Joint School\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of January 20th concerning the Jule children.\n\nWe have not yet received any reply to that communication, and I would appreciate hearing from you at once.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nTeslin Lake Joint School\n\nReference above and your letter of 14th instant, file 930-1 (E1). You refer to a letter of January 20th re the above, but my files only show letters of January 23rd and February 8th under the heading of Teslin Joint School. Mr. MacDonald and I spent three hours on the evening of the 21st looking for the a/m file. May a copy of your letter of January 20th be forwarded please.\n\nI have not been to visit Teslin to interview Charlie Jules since December as I have been informed he has been away intermittently a great part of the winter.\n\nI am not clear as to whether the Teslin Joint School is to be regarded as denominational. The Territorial Government schools are not so regarded.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nTeslin Lake Joint School\n\nReference is to your query regarding the salary of the teacher.\n\nIt appears that no action is necessary by this Department concerning the salary paid to this teacher (presently Miss Clancy) as she is a full-time employee of the Yukon Territorial school system.\n\nYou have seen the photographs of this school and my comments thereon, and you have approved the suggestion to defer construction at this point until the possible developments at Teslin appear more clearly.\n\nThis development may include the provision of facilities for children of the R.C.A.F. personnel. In that event the Yukon Government and the Department of National Defence might be influenced to set up a larger establishment suited to the needs of an enlarged White population. Provision for married quarters is already being made at the Watson Lake air station and Teslin is, I understand, next on the list for this enlargement.\n\nIn his letter of October 4, the Superintendent of Yukon schools outlines the agreement under which these joint schools are operated. Our Department is somewhat in...\narrears in providing the school building. An associated Department is, however, providing accommodation for the teacher. Perhaps we should ask Mr. Superintendent Meek whether we are providing fuel for the school and the residence. Light for the school is supplied by the airport electricity plant.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nTeslin Territorial School:\n\nI visited this school on June 14 and noted that there were fifteen pupils present. The Indian pupils were:\n\n| NAME       | AGE | GRADE | RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION |\n|------------|-----|-------|------------------------|\n| Douglas Smartt | 15  | 4     | C & E                  |\n| Harry Smartt   | 13  | 3     | C & E                  |\n| Frank Peters   | 13  | 2     | R.C.                   |\n| Teresa Peters  | 11  | 2     | R.C.                   |\n\nAbsent (not yet returned from Whitehorse Truck meet)\n\nPenny Jackson    | 16+ | 4     | C & E                  |\nMargaret Jackson | 15+ | 4     | C & E                  |\nHarry Jackson    | 13  | 4     | C & E                  |\n\nThe children present said that they had seen Peter Symes in the area on the previous day. His boy and the two Peters children are expected by Rev. H. Kirnne to attend the seasonal school when the territorial term closes next winter. The father of the Peters children says the Peters children will be sent to a residential school at Lower Post.\n\nThe white pupils attending are not, in any case, children of service personnel at the airport. The provision of married quarters at the airport or a re-location of Highway Headquarters camp, together with the opening of a Roman Catholic residential school, would reduce the Indian enrollment at this school to a very minor fraction of the whole. I have accordingly requested Mr. Sipt. Muck, to postpone further action.\nTo erect the proposed new small log school as it might become inadequate or unsuitable to local needs in a very short time. Something better will likely be required.\n\nThe children told me that Teslin Lake is already warm enough for them to go \"swimming\" but that they don't know much about swimming. I told them that we would try to supply literature on the subject. Teslin Lake is about ninety miles long and there is still ice at the northern end. On the preceding Sunday I saw plains land and lake off, people catching fish, children bathing, and Indians drawing water for drinking and washing. It has a high scenic value, too, and mosquitoes and flies are less troublesome than elsewhere.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\n\nCopy to Sept., Yukon Indian Agency.\nJune 22, 1950.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nTealin Joint School\n\nShortly after writing to you on June 20 we received Major Clark's report of June 16.

The school building is inadequate, lighting is poor, and sanitation unsatisfactory. If the school is to be continued a new school should be erected and an apartment for the teacher provided. At present the teacher is living in the Public Health Nurse's residence.\n\n\"The school at Teslin is unique, in that it is the only school in Yukon Territory where both white and Indian children are in attendance. I am convinced that the Department of Indian Affairs will realize the necessity of improving facilities for pupils and the teacher.\"\n\nThe present school building should have certain alterations and I have requested an estimate of the cost. I will include in the 1950-51 Estimates a one-room school with teacherage, or standard design, which I understand are available at Headquarters.\n\nN.J. Meek\n(H.J.

The same table shows the following non-Indians in attendance: 3 in Grade I, 1 in Grade II, and 2 in Grade V. This means that some 18 children are now attending.\n\nDue to the difficulties in building at Teslin, would it be possible to erect a log school building? This\nwould not only give employment to the Indians but would also be much cheaper to erect. Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson is now erecting such a school on the Alexis Reserve and Major Clark has commented very favourably upon the design. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Gooderham as he will probably wish to comment on these proposals.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Gooderham\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nYour letter of 6th instant, file 930-5 (E), concerning the Teslin Joint School. The building of a Joint Day School, with teacherage, is recommended. Your suggestion of using native logs is feasible, in fact, I would prefer it to using Outside materials. It would have the added advantage, as you point out, of being cheaper to construct, and would be a source of employment to local Indians.\n\nI would recommend the use of oil heat in the school to avoid extremes in temperature during winter time. There are one or two local carpenters well skilled in the building of log houses and structures.\n\nThe O.C. R.C.A.F. informs me there are four married quarters at Teslin, and a total personnel of about nine. Department of Transport employ five men permanently. There are also a number of civilian personnel on the airbase. Miss Adams, teacher, suggests a schoolroom designed for 30 pupils. While this figure may not be reached for a few years, it is quite within the limit of possibility. A teacherage is necessary, present arrangements are temporary, as Miss Adams has been living in the Nursing Station, Indian Health Services.\n\nI have conferred with Crown Lands Agent W.M. Emery, who suggest that two lots be requested for the use of a school. I shall take up this matter further and in due course application for land will be made through the usual channels.\n\n(R.J.

This is our standard one-room school and attached residence. It would be quite expensive to build at Teslin. You might speak to local contractors to get an idea as to how much it would cost.\n\nWe do not have funds available in this year's Vote for the construction of this building. It will be necessary for you to include the amount in your next year's estimates. By sending you the plans we hope to help you in deciding the approximate cost to be included.\n\nBernard F.

With 14 Indian and 8 white pupils, the makeshift school is very overcrowded. During the summer holiday, new fluorescent lighting was installed, also an additional window and two ventilators, which have been noticeable improvements. The most important project of 1950 will be the building of a 30-pupils school and teacherage at Teslin. I note that the white population of Teslin area is well over 200. There are 132 Indians of the Yukon Agency and about 50 belonging to Stikine Agency. A two-room school within three or four years would not be outside the realm of probability.\n\n26/11/49\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1949   | Yukon Agency Vote 516-08-912 Education       |        |\n| Nov. 28| To four months rental of building used as a joint school, at Teslin, Y.T., from May, June, September, and October, 1949, at the rate of $15.00 per month, as per account attached. | 60.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The amount of $30,000.00 in estimates for the above school has apparently been based on cost of school of similar nature at Upper Hay River; this was anticipated in my letter of August 30th covering the 1950-51 estimates.\n\nI would recommend that project be carried out by contract. The Canadian Army at Whitehorse has an Engineer Company with several professional engineers. We have always received fullest cooperation from the Army and I feel they would be willing to carry out certain inspections at the above school from time to time.\n\nBuilding project form attached hereto. Please note that Notice of Intention for land has been made. I shall make formal application for the land in the very near future. Plan of lots required is also attached hereto.\n\nThere is a large diesel plant at the R.C.A.F. station, Teslin, which, on application, could provide electricity for the school. Teslin Lake is about 50 yards from the proposed site, I do not think there would be the slightest difficulty in sinking a well with success.\n\nLumber pile from the dismantled Johnston's Crossing buildings is about four miles from proposed Joint School site.

If you wish further details on this type of school, I would recommend that you write to Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson at Edmonton as he has had considerable experience in erecting these buildings.\n\nWe could send you an accountable advance for the logs which would be required for both the school and the teacherage and these could be cut now so that they will be ready for use next summer.\n\nI believe it would be quite acceptable to have the logs squared as is common practice in the Yukon. With regard to asbestos shingles, these were only a wartime acceptance and we are now using cedar siding for the exteriors of our schools.\n\nBernard F.

During the next couple of months would be a good time to get out the logs for the proposed school. I have a bid for this work from Mr. Glen Rear, Teslin, as follows:\n\nsquared on three sides to six inches $35.00 per thousand\nsquared on three sides to five inches 30.00 per thousand.\n\nIt is presumed Mr. Rear means per thousand lineal feet and not board measurement. In a recent conversation with him he states he will be employing Indians for this work.\n\nYou state \"while we do follow Plan 882 for the classroom, we provide a separate teacherage.\" Not knowing just to what extent this will alter requirements for logs, I do not know how many lineal feet of five or six inch squared logs will be required.\n\nDepartment of Transport and R.C.A.F. buildings at Teslin are made from three-quarter squared logs, six inches thick, and it appears that this size is most suitable for school purposes.\n\nI would suggest that your recommendation that accountable advance be sent to this Agency for logs be followed. The price quoted includes hauling to proposed site of school and teacherage. I shall communicate to Superintendent Robertson, Edmonton, concerning these buildings.\n\n(J.J.

The Church of England has now a native clergyman, the Rev Amos Njootli in charge of the Mission. He does all he can in teaching the Indians to read and write in their own tongue, and with considerable success. He travels with the Indians to their hunting grounds, and holds school regularly. He does not, however, teach the English language, and I know it would be a great advantage if we could have a regular teacher in English for the Indian children. Here again financial difficulties have been in the way. The Indians at Rampart House spend most of their time in hunting and trapping and are scattered all over the country. For a short time some of them gather together at one place, and during this period school could be held, but when the parents go off to hunt again, their children must accompany them, unless someone is prepared to keep them, and this would require a boarding school of some kind. The government grant for day schools is now given according to the number of days school is held. I am afraid under the circumstances at Rampart House, the grant would go only a very small way towards the expense of keeping a teacher. Because of the remoteness of the place it would be impossible for a man to come and go very frequently, and he would have to settle down for the year. The cost of salary and travelling expense would be considerable, and thus again financial difficulties are hard to overcome. However, I hope we may be able to do something in the course of time to pro-\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 931-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nvide a regular school at Rampart House, and I shall be glad to discuss the question with you again at any time.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Isaac O. Yukon,\nSir,\n\nTwo applications for the establishment of Indian Day Schools have been recently received, one from Rampart House, the other from Forty Mile. I wrote the Bishop of Yukon in reference to the above as he has missionary establishments at both these places. I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of his reply.\n\nI presume that the Department will not do more than make the customary grants in aid of day schools at the aforementioned places.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nSup't of Indians.\nOttawa, January 13, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th of November, last, enclosing a copy of a communication addressed to you by His Lordship the Bishop of the Yukon in reference to the applications for the establishment of day schools in the Yukon Territory, one at Rampart House and the other at Forty Mile.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the establishment of day schools at either of these places at present and I have to request that you will be good enough to advise His Lordship accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Original on 147654/1.\n\nRegarding the school at Rampart House on the Upper Porcupine River I beg to say that the Department will allow a grant at the rate of $400.00 per annum for the teacher's salary at this place, as well as $100.00 towards the rent of a building.\n\nThe rate of payment at both Ross River and Rampart House will be made in accordance with the number of days these schools are open and will only be made on the receipt of returns showing the number of days the schools were in operation and the attendance.\nDecember 23rd, 1926.\n\nMemo for File:\n\nBishop Stringer informs me that the work at Rampart House and Old Crow Village is linked together and that these schools should be fairly regular all the year round. It is the intention to have the regular missionary teach in one or the other throughout the year and he will be assisted by native workers at both schools. I believe it is the intention to use the graduates of Carcross for this purpose. His Lordship states that the work cannot be undertaken in this manner unless the $5.00 per diem grant from the Department is allowed.\nOttawa, June 19, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that, owing to recent orders for a reduction in our Appropriation, it has been found necessary to discontinue the grant which is provided towards teachers' salaries at a number of our Indian day schools during the current year.

Cote. Around these posts are gathered some 200 Indians, all emigrants from the Mackenzie River and principally from Fort Norman. They belong to the Slavi tribe and speak a distinct language to the Indians of the Yukon. Having spent six years among the Slavis I am acquainted with their language.\n\nThe traders report them as being a fairly industrious people and comparatively healthy. During the past year one of the traders paid them over $3,000.00 for the furs they brought to him and no doubt the other firm paid them quite as much if not more, they are a larger firm and carry a bigger stock.\n\nGame is plentiful in the district, there is no market for their meat very few white people are in this vicinity. Both white fish and salmon are caught in the lakes and rivers but the salmon are not plentiful.\n\nThere is no day school but one of the members of the band, a man trained by myself years ago, holds school in the native tongue, most of the younger members of the band can read and write in their own tongue. He also conducts religious services. He is not permanently stationed at Ross River but travels about with the band and conducts school when not on hunting expeditions.\n\nThey are not settled in log cabins but live in tents and tepees.\n\nA supply of simple medicines was given to Mr Cote for the benefit of the Indians. In cases of sickness and destitution relief is given in the way of provisions by Cote from the fund provided by the Department to meet such cases.\n\nNo attempt at farming has been made by any of the band as they are constantly on the move.\n\nHave made arrangements with the trader to send in reports of births and deaths. He will have no difficulty in getting accurate statistics.\nREPORT OF ROSS RIVER BAND OF INDIANS (Cont)\n\nI was unable to arrange a visit to this band the small steamer that I was to have gone by sailed some days earlier than at first planned so that when I reached Selkirk she was already gone. On my second trip up the Yukon I found the boat at the foot of the rapids unable to get through, she was held up there for two weeks. I hope to visit them next spring when navigation re-opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt of Indians.\nDawson,Y.T. Oct 1st, 1914.\n\nJ.D.McLean Esq,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a report of\nthe Ross River band of Indians. This band and the one at Ram-\npart House are the farthest outlying bands in the Territory,\nthere is practically no communication with them during the\nwinter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSup't of Indians.\nOttawa, October 26, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant enclosing a report of the Ross River Band of Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indians,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDecember 22nd, 1926.\n\nMemo for File:\n\nBishop Stringer informs me that the Ross River Indian Day School, which is linked up with the work at Little Salmon, is bound to be more irregular and will, of course, be conducted only during the summer. I agreed to continue the $5.00 per diem rate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 931-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDawson, Y.T. June 2nd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon has notified me that the following students have been sent to the undermentioned places and will conduct Indian day schools while in residence.\n\nMr. O.W.R. Hughes, Selkirk,\nMr. M.C. Humphrey, Carmacks\nMr. \u2014 Semple, Tealin Lake.\nMr. W.I.B. Stringer, Champagne.\n\nThe first three are students from the Anglican College, Vancouver B.C., the other is a son of the Bishop, he is from Toronto University and has completed his fourth year in medical work.\n\nThe Bishop also suggests that a supply of school material be sent to Mary Martin, daughter of Rev. John Martin (native clergyman stationed at Ross River). Mary is an ex-pupil of the Hay River Indian Residential School. I do not know anything of her qualifications as a teacher and am in doubt as to whether school material should be supplied until she is accepted as a teacher by the Department. Kindly advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that it is noted that seasonal schools will be conducted this summer in the Yukon, as follows:\n\nSelkirk - Mr. O.W.R. Hughes.\nCarmacks - Mr. M.C. Humphrey.\nTeslin Lake - Mr. Semple.\nChampagne Landing - Mr. W.I.B. Stringer.\nRoss River - Miss Mary Martin.\n\nFrom the information given in your letter, it appears that all of the above are competent of taking charge of the schools mentioned, with the possible exception of Miss Martin. No doubt, you can make some further inquiries regarding her and, if the information you receive is satisfactory, you may forward a small supply of school material consisting of articles that are absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated June 26th, file No. 166-14-1, in reference to the seasonal Indian day schools in the Yukon Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in the case of the school at Selkirk it will be kept in operation during the whole of the coming school year. Mr. O.W.R. Hughes having completed his course at the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, B.C., taking the prize for reading, was ordained on July 4th, and appointed to the charge of Selkirk and instructed by the Bishop to teach and keep the school open regularly in accordance with the requirements of the Department.\n\nCarmacks, Teslin Lake and Champagne Landing will be seasonal schools.\n\nA small supply of school material has been sent to Mary Martin at Ross River. Until further proof of her ability to teach is forthcoming I do not see my way clear to recommend a grant for this school. No record of the number of pupils attending has been received at this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.\nSecretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 931-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed day school returns of attendance at the Ross River Indian day school were sent in by the Bishop of Yukon, Dr A.H. Sovereign, who expresses a hope that the Department will be disposed to give the matter favorable consideration and allow a grant.\n\nIt will be noted that the Bishop has, on the return form, made a note regarding the teacher, Mary Martin. The girl is a full native she has been taught by her father, Rev John Martin. She has not attended any Residential School, she is bright and energetic but her English is rather crude, I called the Bishop's attention to this also to the requirement of the Department that teachers must be competent to teach English correctly.\n\nThe Bishop says that he does not expect that the Department would be willing to make a grant equivalent to what would be paid to a white teacher but hopes that some small grant will be made for the work that has been done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 1490-G-1 of the 29th of April, enclosing returns showing the attendance at the Ross River Indian Day School.\n\nWhile Miss Martin's qualifications as a teacher are not as good as the Department would desire, it has been decided, in view of the report of His Lordship, the Bishop of Yukon, to allow her the sum of $220. for the period the school was in operation to March 31st, 1932, the end of the last fiscal year. A cheque for this amount is being issued and sent to Rt. Rev. A. H. Sovereign, D.D.,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nDawson, Y. T.,\nJuly 2nd, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report in regard to the Indians of the Yukon Agency and conditions as found by me on my recent inspection tour of the Agency. During this inspection trip all points of the Agency were visited with the exception of the Francis Lake district, and conditions were found to be improved over last year.\n\nx x x x\n\nAt Ross River practically all the Indians were in the Village. A fair fur catch is reported here, but as the Indians of this district dispose of their fur at several widely scattered trading posts it is practically impossible to get any idea as to the amount of fur caught during the season, however I received no complaints and I could see an improvement in these Indians from my visit last year. It is unfortunate that the day school is closed at this point as there are several children of school age who are getting no education.\n\nx x x x\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Binning\n(Signed)\nA/Supt. Dept. Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nThe following report is submitted in regard to the Indians of the Yukon agency.\n\n9. At Ross River very few of the Indians were in the village at the time of my visit, most of them being away at Pelly Banks where they had been muskrating and had not got back with their catch. The catch is reported as fair but I am unable to say just how this band will be in regard to money matters. It is unfortunate that the day school at this place is closed as there are several children of school age who are getting no education.\n\nG.

T.\n\nthis 24th Oct. 1916\n\nAgents and Superintendents should see that full explanations are given by the teacher in the column for \"Remarks,\" if the school was closed during the quarter for other than authorized holidays, and should also themselves make any necessary comments in that column.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO TEACHERS\n\n1. Fill up all the columns in this Return.\n2. All the columns of the Return must be added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n3. The total number of days absent and days present not to be omitted, as these two columns added together should give the total number of school days.\n4. Number and dates of holidays to be inserted in the column for remarks.\n5. By the total number of school days in the quarter is meant the number of days in the quarter exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays. All authorized holidays will be paid for.\n6.

The standard course for each class will be found on the back of the Daily Register and is to be followed.\n7. No names other than those of Indian children are to be included in this Return.\n8. The Quarterly Returns must end on the 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and be immediately thereafter in each case transmitted to the Department through the Local Indian Agent or other authorized official.\n9. When, owing to the number of pupils, the form of Return is not long enough to contain all the names, use another form, paging it as No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns. Do not increase the length of the form by pasting another, or portion of one, to it.\n10. The average daily attendance during the quarter may be ascertained by dividing the total number of days' attendance of all the pupils by the number of days school was open in the quarter.\n11. No teacher's salary will be paid until this return has been received by the Department.\n12.

During the months of June and July I had school open both in the morning and in the afternoon when the attendance was much larger.\n\nDuring these two months school was open 3\u00bd hours daily and for a total of 60 days.\n\nThe school was open from July 1931 to Dec. 1931. During the month of Dec. and Jan. and Feb. 1932 school was open for two hours daily and for 67 days. This makes a total of one hundred and forty-four days that school has been open between last March and the end of Feb. of this year. The average daily attendance was approximately 8 pupils.\nI am giving a list of the names of the pupils who have attended school at one time or another. Most of these are merely summer attendants. The only children of school age who can possibly attend are my own sister and brother, 3 of the half-breeds children of Mr. Etzel, and 3 of the native children.\n\nThe rest of the children who are natives leave the post early in August and not return until the following summer.\nDAY SCHOOL RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance period and tuition at the Rose River, Yukon Territory School for the quarter ended June-August 1934.\n\nTeacher: (Miss) Mary Martin\nRoss River, Yukon\n\nP.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRev. J. Hawksley,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nDear Mr. Hawksley,\n\nIn conversation with you the other day you stated that the Educational Secretary of the Indian Department had intimated that the holding of Lay Schools at Ross River and Carmacks was of a spasmodic character and it was doubtful if the results obtained warranted the expenditure, and you suggest that I should give an expression of opinion on this matter.\n\nI wish to explain to the Department the local conditions with reference to these and other Indian Lay Schools in Yukon. The Indians make a living wholly by hunting, trapping and fishing\u2014while a few are employed in cutting wood along the river or as helpers on steamboats in Summer. In some cases they have to travel from place to place in order to make a living. Besides it is generally considered unwise to encourage the Indians to stay around the trading posts or missions for any length of time unless they have some useful occupation in the neighborhood. As a rule the Indians come in to the various centres at certain times of the year chiefly during the Spring and early Summer. At such periods the children are available for school and we have tried to take advantage of the presence of the children to hold day schools. For the greater part of the year there are no children, or at least very few at these centres. The Indians are scattered generally, and as a rule only a family or two are found in one place.\n\nA few years ago we had a permanent missionary at Carmacks and Little Salmon and he was able to hold school for a few weeks at a time. He found it was impossible to hold school during certain periods of the year because there were no children to attend. Mr. Wilkinson was stationed for a time at Little Salmon last Summer and had a very good attendance of twenty to twenty-five children for a week and they were making good progress when suddenly the Indians all moved away into the hills. They were right out of food and had to go out to hunt or they would starve. In a short time the whole camp was deserted.\n\nFor the last few years College students have been employed as teachers and they have endeavored to take full advantage of that period in the Spring when most of the Indians gather at the various centres. It is hoped that a permanent man may be secured.\nbefore long who will visit several centres, but even then it will be difficult to hold school much more regularly than under the present arrangements.\n\nThe grant from the Indian Department is given only for the actual number of days during which school is held. Now some one must be responsible for the salaries of the men during the long periods when it is impossible to hold school and therefore impossible for him to earn any grant from the Indian Department. If an annual grant were given towards the teachers salary, the Indian Department would in this way assume a proportion of the risk. The number of the Indians in some of the localities is rather small and it seems too much to expect that a man should spend all his time for one small band.\n\nI do not know in what way the work could be better done taking everything into consideration. Even if the children got only a months teaching at a time, it is better than nothing, and we simply have to do the best we can for these Indians.\n\nI shall be glad to co-operate with the Indian Department in every way possible and shall be glad of any suggestions by which the schools could be made more efficient.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Yukon.\n\nYUKON AGENCY\n\nFEB 4 1925\n\nDawson, - Y.T.\nSir,\u2014 referring to your letter dated Dec 15th, 1924.\n\nIn reference to the grant for the Carmacks and Ross River day schools, I beg to say that as requested I have taken the matter up with the Bishop of Yukon who has sent me the enclosed report.\n\nFor several years past the Bishop has been bringing in students from Toronto and Saskatoon to work for two or three of the summer months in the vacant missions and to teach Indian day schools whenever possible. This is rather a costly procedure and it is somewhat doubtful whether the experiment justifies the expense entailed on the Bishop's funds. The Bishop looks to the Department's grant given for the number of days that the schools are in operation to help to defray the salaries and travelling expenses of these students.\n\nOne point of view is that if these students did not teach the Indian children when the opportunity arises they would get nothing in the way of education.\n\nAnother point is that such spasmodic and intermittent teaching is not likely to be very effective. Two weeks teaching in a year with no effort on the part of the pupil to keep up what he has been taught has a tendency to become lost so that when the pupil returns to the school again in the summer the work has to be done all over again. It may be said that it is doubtful whether any real progress is made. There may be and are isolated cases where a pupil learns to read and write but these are not numerous. However, it is the best that can be done under the circumstances.\nIn this large territory where the Indians are so widely scattered in small bands.\n\nIf it were possible for the Bishop to obtain the services of a permanent missionary with headquarters at Carmacks, one who is both willing and able to travel from place to place when the Indians are gathered there and do what teaching he could as long as the Indians stayed around, it is quite possible that the results would be greater.\n\nI would like to add that I am satisfied that the Bishop is very anxious to do all he possibly can for the Indians though it has a heavy drain on his available resources. I would therefore recommend that the grant usually given for the number of days that these occasional Indian schools are in operation be continued if at all possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 4, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1491-A of the 4th ultimo and I note that you have discussed with His Lordship the Bishop of Yukon the advisability of continuing the day school activity at Ross River and Carmacks. I have read the letter from His Lordship, which you enclosed, and I note your recommendation. The Department will continue its per diem grant in the case of these Indian schools, as heretofore.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nDawson, Yukon,\nFeb. 9, 1925.\n\nRev. J. Hawksley,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, Yukon.\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nDear Mr. Hawksley,\n\nFollowing up my letter to you of Jan. 31st last inasmuch as the question has been raised by your Department as to whether they were justified in making grants to certain Day Schools in Yukon which are open only for a short time each year.\n\nI wish to draw your attention again to some of the difficulties with which we have to contend in carrying on these schools. Take for example Teslin School\u2014 for the last two Summer Mr. Wilkinson a University graduate has gone to Teslin chiefly for the purpose of teaching Indian Day School. On both occasions he went as early as possible and remained till the Indians were moving away to their hunting grounds. In 1923 he was able to hold school thirty-eight days and in 1924 school was held for thirty days. During that period school was held both afternoons and evenings. The children attended pretty regularly and were anxious to learn and consequently made good progress. Mr. Wilkinson did not spare himself and devoted his whole time to the Indians. After school hours, he engaged in healthy outdoor games with the Indian children such as would develop the Indian boys and girls both physically and socially. In his report for 1924 he states that he noticed the children retained a good deal of the teaching given them in 1923.\n\nThe short Summer period is the only time that the Indians are assembled together, and unless we take advantage of this season to hold school it is difficult to do much otherwise in the way of education. This whole tribe is above the average in intelligence, and the children are brighter and keener than most Indian children in Yukon. Moreover some of the children continue their studies to some extent out in the woods. I know also that the schooling given to the children encourage some of them even after they grow older to continue on in their studies. The result is shown by the fact that generally as a result of the start they receive at schools quite a number of Indians in different parts of the Territory are able to write letters and read a little, and also work out arithmetical problems such as are necessary in trading etc.\n\nThese small schools seem to be well worth while, and I think the expenditure is warranted even though the cost may seem fairly high.\nIn Mr. Wilkinson's case I know a part of his time was spent in missionary work and a portion of his expenses should be charged to other than school work. The travelling expenses alone were considerable. For example it cost $95.00 to get from Whitehorse to Teslin and return besides the other travelling expenses. After a careful calculation I have charged $350.00 as the proportion of cost to be assigned to Mr. Wilkinson's school work at Teslin. Your Department has made a grant of $90.00- the per diem grant being even smaller than usual. I think the Indian Department might easily increase this and other grants to Indian Day Schools.\n\nIf you Department had to carry on these schools, you would have a good deal of worry and trouble in engaging workers besides the much heavier cost entailed. At present I take all the risk regarding the number of days in which school can be held, but the expense is practically the same whether we are able to hold school for a shorter or longer period, while the Department gives remuneration only for the actual number of days during which school is held irrespective of what it really costs.\n\nProbably the plan of making a per diem grant is as good as any but a larger grant would be more equitable considering the cost of operating such schools, and I wish to ask the Department to increase the grants of different schools which can be kept open only for a short period each year.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 931-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt: DAWSON, Y.

The average daily attendance during the quarter may be ascertained by dividing the total number of days attendance of all the pupils by the number of days school was open in the quarter.\n10. Should the school be closed at any time during the quarter, the reason must be given in the column for remarks for such day or days.\n11. The school must be opened and closed punctually at the hours approved of by the Department.\n12.

July 26th, 1917.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the returns of an Indian Day School that has been held at Old Crow River. This is the first intimation I have had of the existence of this school. I am also enclosing a copy of a letter sent to me by the Bishop of Yukon which speaks for itself.\n\nA small band of Indians have, for some years past, made Old Crow River their central place and have built some cabins there, a trading post has also been opened at the village.\n\nRegarding Murdo Baalam I cannot say much as to his qualifications but the Rev J. Davies met him some time ago when on a visit to Rampart House, he speaks very highly of him. I am unable to give the number of the band located there.\n\nJudging from the Bishop of Yukon's letter it would appear that the school would only be open periodically.\n\nIf the Department take any action in this matter may I ask that notification be sent at the earliest convenience as the season is so short for getting anything up there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOld Crow River,\nJune 19th, 1917\n\nMy dear Mr Hawksley:\n\nMurdo Baalam, a graduate of the Hay River School, has been teaching school for the last three months at Old Crow River village. He is making out the returns for this quarter and will enclose them in this to you. He has done well and has a very creditable school even without any facilities. It might be considered an outstation of Rampart House School and as such I shall be glad if you will send this return in and see if something can be done in allowing a grant for this school, when Murdo is at Rampart House he helps Jacob Njootli with the school. Jacob will send in his returns separately.\n\nI shall be glad if you can supply Murdo with say 2 dozen slates and a dozen or so of part one phonic primer and some slate pencils and some sort of a map. I gave him one of the roller lesson series and that will help. Any other books would be acceptable such as an arithmetic, Geography, Copy Books or perhaps Scribblers and pencils.\n\nOld Crow is sixty miles above Rampart House.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Isaac O. Yukon.\nOttawa, August 15, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing a copy of a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of the Yukon regarding the school which has recently been started at Old Crow River Village and also forwarding a return showing the attendance for the three months ending June 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow the same grant for the teacher's salary and rent to this school as is provided for the school at Rampart House, viz.\u2014$400.00 for salary of teacher and $100.00 for rent of building; the payment of both salary and rent will be based on the number of days the school is in operation and will be made only upon receipt of quarterly returns of attendance.\n\nHis Lordship states that this school may be considered an outstation of Rampart House School and the Department would like to be informed as to whether the Indians move from one point to the other during certain seasons of the year.\n\nWith reference to the request of the Bishop that this school be supplied with school material I beg to say that you may purchase and forward two dozen slates. The primers, slate pencils and other supplies asked for will be forwarded to you for transmission to the teacher at Old Crow River Village.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 932-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYou will be good enough to inform His Lordship the Bishop of the Yukon of the Department's decision to provide a grant towards salary and rent for this school. The teacher should be instructed to forward returns promptly at the end of each quarter for the period the school is in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Aug 15th, file# 503000/1, in reference to the Bishop of Yukon's application for a grant for the Indian Day School at Old Crow River.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that the Bishop has been duly notified of the Department's decision to make a grant of $400.00 for salary of teacher and $100.00 for rent of building, both salary and rent to be based upon number of days school is in operation and will be made only upon receipt of quarterly returns of attendance.\n\nReferring to the Indians of Old Crow River they have, in the past been in the habit of hunting and trapping in the district and going to Rampart House to trade their furs. A trading store has now been established at Old Crow therefore the Indians are quite likely to remain there. They may occasionally go to Rampart House to visit the other members of the band but probably will not go often. It is gratifying to know that the trader has married a lady missionary and trained nurse who has been working among the Indians of Fort Yukon Alaska. She writes me that she will do what she can in attending to the Indians medically, the place is so remote that it is difficult to give these Indians adequate medical attendance.\n\nRegarding the purchase of slates your instructions will be carried out and they will be forwarded with the school material being sent here by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the Bishop of Yukon has appointed the following teachers to the Indian Day Schools of the Yukon.\n\nMoosehide:- Mr John Lawrence, age 48 years, was a school teacher up to the time he came to the Yukon, he is fully qualified to teach. This appointment is a temporary one until the return of the Rev B.Totty next year.\n\nRampart House:- The Rev George Henry Moody, age 42 years, has had previous experience in Indian school at Alert Bay, B.C. He is a graduate of Latimer College, Vancouver, B.C. He succeeds Mr Jacob Njootli, resigned.\n\nHerschell Island (Eskimo):- The Rev William A. Geddes B.A. graduate of Dalhousie University, N.S. and Wycliffe College Toronto, age 26 years, He is successor to Rev W.H.Fry who resigned last year.\n\nChampagne Landing:- School closed no teacher being available.\n\nSelkirk:- Miss Kathleen Martin continues her work at this school.\n\nThe Bishop states also that Mr W.D.Young will teach school at Shingle Point whenever there are pupils available.\n\nCrow River:- The Bishop writes \"I wish also to inform you that Murdo Jootli also known as Murdo Baalim has taught an Indian School on and off for the last three or four years at Crow River. He is about 20 years of age.\"\nJ.D.M. (2)\n\nand had six years training in the Hay River Indian Boarding School. I visited his school this summer and found he had between 20 and 30 children in school. He showed considerable ability as a teacher for children in the lower grades and the pupils were making fair progress. He is to continue teaching whenever the children assemble in sufficient numbers and the Rev G.H. Moody is to visit him occasionally and give him instruction and encouragement.\n\nNo returns having been sent in from the Crow River school during the last year or so I came to the conclusion that it was closed. It is the most remote school in the Yukon Territory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of the Old Crow River Indian Day School for the quarters ending March 31st, and June 30th, 1920.\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon in forwarding the returns writes as follows: \"During the past three years Murdo Baalam has taught school pretty regularly. This might in one sense be considered part of the Rampart House school. Some of the Indians attended part of the time at Rampart and part at Old Crow River. However I think that the amount of teaching done on the Porcupine River by these two teachers is fairly satisfactory and justifies the grant given by the Department.\"\n\n\"I wish to ask the Indian Department to make a grant towards the school carried on by Murdo Baalam at Old Crow in addition to the short period during which school was held at Rampart House by Jacob Njootli.\"\n\nI advised the Bishop of the possibility of there being no appropriation for the Old Crow River school no returns having been received from there for a long time past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing the quarterly returns of the Old Crow Indian Day School for the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th, 1920.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for the amount of salary and rent due for the two above quarters is being sent to His Lordship the Bishop of The Yukon. The bonus has also been allowed Murdo Baalam, the teacher, for the two quarters and the cheque has been sent him in your care.\n\nI may add that a cheque has also been forwarded to the Bishop for the amount due Jacob Njoctli for the short period which he taught the school at Rampart House. The return showed that this school was only open sixteen days. He is not entitled to any bonus for the above period the school was open during the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nOttawa, September 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo informing the Department of the teachers appointed by His Lordship the Bishop of The Yukon to the Indian day schools of The Yukon.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the following appointments, namely:\n\n- The temporary appointment of Mr. John Lawrence to the Mooshide School until the return of Rev. B. Totty.\n- Rampart House: The appointment of Rev. George Henry Moody to succeed Jacob Jootli, resigned.\n- Herschell Island: Rev. William A. Geddes, B.A., to succeed the Rev. W. H. Fry.\n- Champagne Landing: It is noted that this school is closed on account of no teacher being available.\n- Selkirk: It is noted that Miss Kathleen Martin will continue as teacher of this school.\n- Crow River: The appointment of Murdo Jootli or Baalim, who has had some previous experience is approved. It is noted that he will continue teaching whenever the children assemble in sufficient numbers. It is presumed that this is the same school that is known as Old Crow Village.\n\nGrants at the usual rates will be continued for each of these schools and you should see that the returns are forwarded as promptly as the mail facilities will permit, in order that the amount of grants and bonus due can be paid.\n\nWith reference to the school at Shingle Point I may say that there is no previous record of a school at this place, without it is known under some other name, and no grant for salary has been provided for this school. I shall be pleased if you will give further particulars regarding the location of this school, whether the Indians reside permanently at the place and any other particulars you can, in order that the Department will have full information regarding the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Sept 20th, file # 503000/1, in reference to the Indian day school teachers in the Yukon.\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon has been notified of the Department's approval of the respective appointments and that grants at the usual rates will be continued for each of these schools upon receipt of the quarterly returns.\n\nRegarding the school at Shingle point this may be counted as part of the Herschell Island school as it embraces the same pupils. The reason for opening the school at this point is because the Eskimo of Herschell Island spend greater part of the winter there. Fuel is very scarce and hard to get at the Island therefore the natives move to Shingle point where firewood is more plentiful. Have advised the teacher to include the attendance at Shingle point in the returns for Herschell Island. I trust this method will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nThe day school at Old Crow River and Old Crow village is one and the same, both terms are used here in speaking of this locality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nDawson, V.T., Aug 11th, 1921.\n\nJ. D. McLennan, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of the Old Crew River Indian Day School for the quarters ending Dec 31st, 1920, and March 31st, 1921.\n\nThese returns were sent in by the Bishop of Yukon who states that Murde Joodha or as he is more familiarly known, Murde Baalim has taught the school during the quarters for which the returns are made.\n\nAs no returns have been sent in from this school for a long time past it was considered closed therefore I mentioned to the Bishop the probability of there being no appropriation for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir:-\n\nAn application has come to hand from the Bishop of Yukon requesting that Maggie Daniel, an ex-pupil of the Carcross Indian school, be accepted as teacher of the old Crow River Indian day school, the Rev G.H. Moody having resigned and there is no white missionary available to take his place.\n\nIn a letter dated Nov 13th, received from Chief Joe of the Old Crow band the following paragraph occurs:-\n\"The Rev G.H. Moody has written Neil McDonald (trader) to ask Maggie Daniel to teach school. She did not like to do it at first but I had a talk with her and now she is going to teach school here. I have talked with all the Indians about getting firewood for the school house and they have promised to haul and cut it for her.\"\n\nNo further letters have come from Old Crow therefore I am not in a position to say whether the school has been regularly in operation.\n\nMaggie did very well at the Carcross school though she did not reach high school standard, however, as the school is in the elementary stage she may be considered competent to teach.\n\nIf the Bishop's request is granted by the Department I would venture to suggest that a lower rate be paid for her services than is usual for a white teacher until she has proved her ability as a teacher and whether she has kept the school open for the required number of hours daily.\n\nFurther information has been promised by the Bishop as soon as he can obtain it. It may be deemed advisable to hold the case in abeyance until further information is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley\n\nJ.D.

D. McLean,\nDeputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated March 16th, file No. 503000, in reference to the application of the Bishop of Yukon for the usual grant for the Old Crow River Indian Day School and for the acceptance of Maggie Daniel, an ex-pupil of the Carcross Indian Residential School, as teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that owing to the isolated position of this school and no mail service to this district no letters have been received from Old Crow River since November 1925. Nor is it likely that we shall receive any until sometime in June, after the opening of navigation. The nearest Post Office to Old Crow is about 270 miles away.\n\nIn conversation with the Bishop a few days ago he informed me that he had appointed the Rev Mr McCullum, a graduate of Wycliffe College, Toronto, to the charge of Old Crow River and Rampart House and that it was expected that the rev gentleman would take up his duties there next July and that teaching in the day school would be undertaken by him, therefore the regular appointment of Maggie Daniel is not now necessary.\n\nThe quarterly returns of attendance and any other information regarding the work of this school during the winter will be forwarded to the Department as soon as received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember 22nd, 1926.\n\nMemo for File:\n\nBishop Stringer informs me that the work at Rampart House and Old Crow Village is linked together and that these schools should be fairly regular all the year round. It is the intention to have the regular missionary teach in one or the other throughout the year and he will be assisted by native workers at both schools. I believe it is the intention to use the graduates of Carcross for this purpose.

Geddes\nBishop of Yukon\n\nWAG:GRH\nOLD CROW\n\nThere are about 200 Indians in this district, most of whom were in the village at the time of my visit. The Old Crow flats are famous for the large number of muskrats trapped there, but the last two years the catch has been very poor, however it is hoped that the next season will be a better one. There is very little other fur found in the district so that it makes it very hard on the Indians when the muskrat trapping is poor. Caribou has been very scarce in this district during the past year and the Indians have had to go far afield for meat. This is the heaviest village in the Yukon in regard to relief, there being 16 people drawing rations monthly. There is no day school in Old Crow although there are about 75 children in the district. 40 of whom are of school age. The health of the Old Crow Indians is poor, and there is no medical attention nearer than Fort Yukon, Alaska, except the aid which is rendered by the R.C.M.P. Police detachment at Old Crow. The children all look sickly, in fact the children here are the poorest class I have seen, all appear to be infected from Tuberculosis, and no steps are being taken to improve their health. I would suggest for the consideration of the Department that a trained nurse who could teach school should be sent in to Old Crow during the summer, so that something could be done for the children. If this could be done she could perhaps instill some idea of cleanliness into the heads of the women, who in turn would then be able to look after their children in a better manner. As already stated the children of this place are the poorest I have seen and something should be done to try and improve their general condition of health. The village was found in fair condition, and the Chief and councillors were seen and no complaints received.\nAugust 20th, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. SUTHERLAND:\n\nIn the Mounted Police report on the Yukon you will see a recommendation that the Department establish a summer school at Old Crow to be carried on by a nurse teacher. It seems to me that if anything of this kind is contemplated the worker should be in the district the whole year. The Church of England used to have a missionary in this area. I do not know whether they now have or how strong their interest is. The maintenance of a worker in this area would be fairly expensive, and if you think well of this suggestion I wonder if we could get together on some such basis as the salary of the worker being found from the Medical Appropriation and her maintenance from the Vote for Education. This is a suggestion on which your comment might be useful in submitting the matter to the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\n(Sgd.) E. L. Stone, M. B.,\nDirector of Medical Services.\nOctober 25th, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nWhen Inspector Binning, R.C.M.P., Acting Superintendent of our Department in the Yukon, visited Old Crow last summer, he made a rather disturbing report of health conditions there. Knowing that the Church of England had some missionary activities in the district, we consulted the Bishop of the Yukon as to what suggestion he might have. He has replied that his Church has a native missionary and that he hopes the Department may station a health worker and school teacher at this very remote point.\n\nFrom this place the only outlet is Fort Yukon in Alaska and we have had a good many patients in the hospital at that place, some at least of whom have appeared to us as suitable for home treatment if there was anybody at Old Crow to look after them. There does not appear to be any school there and there should be about forty children of school age. Mr. Sutherland and I have agreed to recommend the stationing of a nurse, who has also been a school teacher, at Old Crow. We do not want to fix the position as permanent and our suggestion is to ask the Bishop of the Yukon to nominate a suitable person for this post, to put not only the person but the work on probation for one year and judge thereafter whether it is profitable to continue. In such a remote place the minimum salary of a nurse should be $1200. per annum and she should have her maintenance in addition. I would make it a condition with the Bishop that the nurse should receive the whole of the salary without any such deductions as are sometimes made. The cost would be $1800. per annum, of which Mr. Sutherland agrees to contribute $600. from the schools fund. As this will have to be provided for in the Estimates we should appreciate your direction.\n\nThe cost will be somewhat offset by a lesser number of patients going to hospital at Fort Yukon, which is not in Canadian territory.\n\nE. L. Stone, M. B.,\nDirector of Medical Services.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\n6011 Churchill,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 5, 1936.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of Nov. 25 regarding a nurse-school teacher for Old Crow in the Yukon Territory, and I am pleased to see that provision is being made in your draft estimates to provide the sum of $1000.00 to cover the salary and maintenance of such a worker, and I sincerely hope that when the final estimates are passed that this particular amount will not have been deleted. I feel quite confident that if the right person can be secured for this position, a great deal that will be a benefit to the Indians of that area can be accomplished.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, Old Crow is a rather remote spot and transportation to and from it is not at all easy. However, in view of the fact that the worker is to combine the two duties, that of school teacher and nurse, I think it should be possible to find one who would be able to undertake the task at the sum mentioned.\n\nI presume that you will be expecting us to provide the living quarters and I have no doubt that this can be arranged. I shall write to you again regarding this matter as you suggest, about the beginning of March next. In the meantime I shall endeavour to find out if a suitable worker can be secured. I have in mind at the moment a fully qualified nurse who has had northern experience and who might be willing to undertake this position, but I fully understand that no definite arrangements can be made until the final estimates have passed parliament.\n\nIn the meantime I should like to bring to your attention another matter concerning Old Crow. In June last there was returned from our school at Carcross an Indian boy who had reached the age limit for Indian education. This young man, Philip Joseph by name, is greatly handicapped in that he has only one leg, and it will be almost impossible for him to earn a living for himself in that country by hunting and trapping. In\norder to help him out in a financial way as well as to find him some occupation, I have arranged for him to teach school during this winter whenever opportunity affords. In this work he will be under the direct supervision of Mrs. Kirk, the wife of the Corporal of the Mounted Police stationed at Old Crow. Mrs. Kirk is a full qualified school teacher who came to Old Crow as a bride this year and she has been most willing to help Philip Joseph in this work. If your department can see its way clear to make a small per diem grant for the days that Philip Joseph will be able to teach school, I feel quite sure that it will be a great help, not only in providing him with the means of livelihood, but to enable him to do something in a country where work is not easy to be had.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. B. Beddoes\nBishop of Yukon.\nDecember 17, 1935.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the engagement of a nurse-school teacher at Old Crow, Yukon Territory. Funds will be available for salary as from April first, next. I would suggest that, in due time, you nominate the services of a qualified nurse-school teacher for this point and inform the department fully concerning the name, age, qualifications and experience.\n\nI note you have arranged to have Philip Joseph, an ex-pupil of the Carcross Indian Residential School, conduct classes at Old Crow during the present winter months and that he will carry on the work under the direct supervision of the wife of the Corporal of the Mounted Police stationed at that point, who is a fully qualified teacher. Regarding your request that a grant be provided towards his salary during the period he teaches this school, I would say that the Department will allow the sum of $2.50 per teaching day. This will be paid upon receipt of a return, showing the attendance and the actual number of days taught by him up to the end of March, next. As our funds during the present fiscal year are limited, this is the full grant we can provide in payment for Philip Joseph's services. I would request that you have him prepare the return, stating definitely the number of days he taught, and forward same to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

I am not sure whether her previous appointments came under your Department or under the North-west Territories Branch of the Department of the Interior.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you as to whether Miss Mc Cabe would be an acceptable person to your Department for this post.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 932-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 16, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 31st ultimo, nominating the services of Miss Mildred McCabe for the position as nurse-school teacher at Old Crow, Yukon Territory. It has noted the qualification which Miss McCabe possesses. The Department is aware, through the officers of the North West Territories Branch of the Department of the Interior, of the satisfactory service she performed in their employ, and her appointment is approved, as from April first, next. It is understood she will be ready to begin duties on or about that date.\n\nThe salary allowed for Miss McCabe's services as nurse will be at the rate of $1200 per annum, and cheques in payment will be sent Your Lordship. She will also be allowed salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month (10 teaching months in school year) for her services as teacher, making a combined salary for nursing and teaching services at the rate of $1800 per annum. Under present regulations, cheques in payment of teachers' salaries are sent to teachers direct. It is understood the church authorities will provide living quarters for Miss McCabe.\n\nMiss McCabe should prepare a return, at the end of each quarter, on the form for that purpose, showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and forward same through the office of the Acting Indian Superintendent, Dawson, Y. T.\n\nIf you will advise the Department of the present address of Miss McCabe, the Chief Medical Officer will communicate with her, giving instructions as to the duties she will be required to perform as nurse.\n\nI shall be pleased, also, if you will state the date on which Miss McCabe begins duties at Old Crow. It is hoped she will meet with every success in her work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. W. A. Geddes, D.

In reply, we agreed to allow $2.50 a teaching day for the period Philip Joseph conducted the school during the winter months. No promise was made to pay for this man's services previous to January first, last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG.

We shall have to make considerable alteration to our Mission House and indeed it may even be necessary to erect a new building.\n\nI am anxious to secure the co-operation of the R.C.M.P. Police in providing accommodation for Miss McCabe until her own quarters are ready, since Mrs. Kirk is the only white woman now living at Old Crow. I feel sure that if you communicated with the Commissioner of the Mounted Police he would authorise the Officer Commanding in Dawson to permit the N.C.O. in charge at Old Crow to provide this accommodation.\n\nIf the Commissioner of the Mounted Police is agreeable I shall be grateful if you will see that the necessary instructions reach the Commanding Officer at Dawson not later than the second of June, which is the probable date of our departure from Dawson.\n\nI am anxious that Miss McCabe should proceed to Old Crow with me at the beginning of June not only because the largest number of Indians are to be found there during June and July, but also that I may arrange her living quarters in a way that will be satisfactory to her.\n\nIt will be of the greatest assistance in establishing this new venture if we could secure the co-operation of the R.C.M.P.

At present common benches are in use.\"\n\nThe Director of this Branch has discussed with me on more than one occasion the very high transportation rates on school desks going to the outlying sections of the Dominion. I have been wondering if it would be possible, in the case of Old Crow and other such schools, to have a local carpenter undertake and make desks that would be measurably satisfactory. You might make inquiries and let me know if a carpenter such as the one I have in mind is available and what the cost of such locally made desks would be.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Stone to teach the school at Selkirk this winter and for Rev. J.W. Ellis to be the teacher of the Old Crow Day School. Prior to coming to the Yukon this summer Mrs. Stone has had considerable experience in School teaching and holds first class qualifications. Rev. J.W. Ellis has had four years' experience in teaching in our Seasonal day Schools in the Yukon. I shall be grateful if you will appoint these teachers to their respective schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.A.

Ellis as teacher of the Old Crow Village Indian Day School.\n\nWe have not received any returns showing the attendance at this school during the academic year 1941-42 and consequently no payment has been made to Mr. Ellis. Please let me know if the school was open during that period and, if so, the usual returns should be forwarded in order that payment may be made to him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo which refers to the Old Crow Village Seasonal School, the Department is prepared to allow the usual amount of $3.00 a day for each day the school was open from April 1, 1942. Before payment can be made it will be necessary for the teacher to forward returns giving the usual information. I enclose forms which the teacher should also complete and send to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. W.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January fifth. There appears to be some misunderstanding regarding the rate of salary to be paid to the teacher at Old Crow in the Yukon.\n\nOn November 25th 1935, the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs wrote to me that an amount of $1800.00 was being placed in the estimates to provide for a nurse-teacher at Old Crow and asked me to secure someone for the position. On February 15, 1936 in accepting my nomination of Miss McCabe, R.N., for this position the Deputy Superintendent General wrote that an amount of $1200.00 would be paid as for the services of the Nurse, and an amount of $600.00 would be paid as a salary for the teacher, and that this sum, on the basis of $60.00 per month for ten teaching months, would be paid direct to Miss McCabe. In the absence of any information to the contrary from Miss McCabe, I assumed that this amount was paid to her during the four years she was at Old Crow. In the light of your letter mentioned above I shall be glad to hear from you just what salary was paid to Miss McCabe from your branch of the service.\n\nWhile at Old Crow Miss McCabe's health broke down and she had to leave there in July 1940. For more than two years she had to remain at home to regain her health and it was only last October that she was able to resume work again. Her breakdown was caused largely by the isolation at a place such as Old Crow, but was in part due to the fact that at Old Crow at certain times of the year all the able-bodied natives leave the settlement and at such times Miss McCabe could secure no one to do the chores, such as bringing the water from the river etc. When she left Old Crow, Miss McCabe very strongly urged me not to send another single woman to such a remote post. She urged, and others whom I consulted agreed, that it would be much better to have at Old Crow a young married couple, the wife being a qualified nurse. In the autumn of 1940 I consulted the Director of Indian Affairs regarding this and he assured me that if a fully qualified person could be found the Department would have no\nobjection to her being married.\n\nIn the spring of 1941 I contacted a young couple in Vancouver who had just been married. The wife had graduated at the head of her class from the Vancouver General Hospital in 1937 and had practiced her profession of Nursing till April 1941. They agreed to go to Old Crow and came to the Yukon in June of that year. Transportation difficulties arose and for a time it looked as if they might not get to Old Crow that year. Eventually however they were able to proceed and reached Old Crow in the early part of September 1941. Mrs Ellis was appointed nurse as from Oct. 1st 1941 and the salary of $100.00 per month has been paid from that date. As Mr Ellis had had previous experience teaching Indians, Mrs Ellis suggested that it would be much better if Mr Ellis did the teaching, and again with the consent of the Director of Indian Affairs I nominated Mr Ellis for the position of Teacher and received your letter making the appointment.\n\nAbout one month ago I received a letter from Mr Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, stating that no salary had been paid because no school returns had been received. I immediately communicated with Mr Ellis and received a reply that Returns had been sent and in due course as your letter states they reached your office. Now you state that instead of paying the teacher on a monthly basis as was agreed when this work was undertaken you are allowing only a per diem grant for the days the School was open. I shall be glad to hear from you regarding this work, and if a change in the agreed remuneration has been made, when and why was it done.\n\nAs regards to the value of the work that was done at Old Crow by Miss McCabe, and the work that is being done at the present time by Mr. and Mrs Ellis, I think there can be no question. I understand that when the Indian Agent visited Old Crow in the summer of 1939 he was so impressed with the work being done there that he advocated the institution of similar workers at other points in the Yukon.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Old Crow Village School. I regret that there has been some misunderstanding regarding the amount of salary to be allowed Mr. Ellis. It is true that we agreed, in official letter of October 24, 1941, to allow him $60.00 a teaching month, plus cost-of-living bonus. We received from him a return for the period the school was open during the December quarter, 1941, but for some reason no salary was paid. On this return Mr. Ellis only showed the names of 12 children and he stated that he had found it impossible to commence school until October 30, 1941.\n\nRecently he forwarded a return for the quarter ended September 30, 1942. This return showed that during that quarter the school had only been open for 39 days. No returns have yet been received from Mr. Ellis for the quarters ended March 31, 1942, June 30, 1942, and December 31, 1942. We have already issued cheque to him in payment of his services for the September quarter, 1942, amounting to $134.55. As soon as he forwards the other returns payment will be made.\n\nI trust that Mr. Ellis has not suffered any undue hardship on account of the delay in paying him for his services as teacher, but I should appreciate it if you would point out to him the necessity of forwarding the quarterly return promptly at the end of each quarter. If he does not receive his cheque within a reasonable time he should advise this office. This will avoid unreasonable delays in paying him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\nTo\nThe Indian agent,\nDAWSON Y.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe, the undersigned Indian residents of the Old Crow district wish to bring to your attention the following points. This is for your consideration in connection with the establishment of an Indian Residential School at Old Crow. This matter having been the subject of some previous discussion between yourself and Joseph NETRO, Old Crow trader, who is one of us.\n\n1st. We are all in favour of a Residential School at Old Crow and would like to see one established here.\n\n2nd. We do not like sending our children to the Residential School at Carcross Y.T. for the following reasons.\n\n(a) We are unable to ever see our children when they are at Carcross School because of the distance involved, and in the past Old Crow children have remained at that school from admission until discharge, in some cases being 13 years of age by that time. During this spread of years they lose touch with their relatives and parents.\n\n(b) At that school children lose touch with our way of life, which is the way they must make their living. When they return they are considered \"no good\" for they have to re-learn our language, learn how to trap and hunt and make their way in the woods, and learn our whole way of life. All of these things they should have learned during childhood years.\n\n(c) There is a great difference in climatic conditions here and at Carcross. We have found that our children upon returning here must become re-acclimatized.\n\n(d) It has been noticed in the past that our children so lose touch with us during a long absence at that school, that they look down upon their parents and our (and their) natural way of life.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why we have not been sending our children to school far from home for the past ten or more years.\n\n3rd. Were a school established at Old Crow, the above disadvantages would be eliminated, and we would be able to see our children occasionally in accordance with school rules, and have their company during holiday periods. We have heard from friends at Aklavik N.W.T. how well it works out when the Residential School is in the district that is native to the child. It appears they are not losing touch with their natural way of life, and their natural climate, and it seems that holiday periods are arranged so that the children are free during the season when the bulk of our yearly income is secured, such as in the muskrat season, the larger children are free, and able to help, as well as becoming proficient in our ways of trapping. We feel that a school at Old Crow would keep the children in touch with us. They would not forget our language, would not disdain the livelihood of their parents which is what they must follow. They would not have forgotten the way in which to hunt, trap and fish and look after themselves in the woods.\n\n4th. We are in favour of a Residential school instead of a day school. A day school requires that the parents of school children remain in the village during the whole of the school term in order to provide a home for the children near the school. This is impossible for us as we must scatter through the district to follow our trapping and hunting. With a Residential School we are able to go our ways and make our living, knowing that our children are receiving the care and training that they need. A Residential School would get away from a situation such as exists at present when there is not day school available due to the lack of a teacher.\nMany of us have discussed the desirability of a move to Akilavik, N.W.T., in order to secure educational facilities. This would allow us to be reasonably close to our children in school. But we do not want to move from Old Crow. Sooner or later we would return here, and in the interim would have lost our own traplines, for we could not expect to hold a trapline during several years of absence. We would have to find some means of livelihood there, or secure a trapline in that area. We would also have to adapt ourselves from a meat diet to a fish diet. We all agree it would be much better for us all were a school established here.\n\nThanking you for your consideration of our needs, and for your request that we write you on this subject\n\nYours very truly\n\n| Peter Moses (Sgd.) | Chief. | Moses Tizya (Sgd.) | Councillor |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Balaam Joodhi      |       | Moses Tizya       | Andrew Tizya |\n| Sarah Balaam       |       | (Mrs.) Moses Tizya| Amos Paul (Porcupine) |\n| (Mrs. Peter Tizya) |       | Mary Rufus Netro  | Daniel FREDSON |\n| Rufus Netro        |       | Charlie Chitze    | Annie Fredson |\n| Peter Charlie      |       | Mary (Charlie)    | John Tizya |\n| Lazarus Peter (CHARLIE) |   | Mary Lazarus(CHARLIE) | Mrs. Maggie Wm (CHITZE) |\n| Joan Njootli       |       | John Kendi        | Mrs. Sarah Joe K.

MEEK\n\nAS/AS\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe your telegram of 8th instant re John Evans, Anglican school teacher, and Old Crow School. I immediately sent a radiogram to Const. E.A. Kirk, R.C.M.P., who advised me in a radiogram received on Nov. 16th, that an aircraft was due within a week and he would send out a lengthy and complete report on the situation. Apparently the information was too detailed to condense in a radiogram. I am awaiting his report.\n\nIn making enquiries concerning conditions at Old Crow it appears a unanimous opinion that the Indians there are of a superior type, industrious, independent and intelligent. The records at Carcross Residential School bear this out.\n\nApparently Anglican missionaries have been associated with Old Crow for many years, and at times have conducted schools for the Indians there. Suitable buildings for school purposes appear to belong to the church.\n\nDuring the latter part of May, 1947, Major C.A.F. Clark had a lengthy conversation by radiophone with Corp. Kirk concerning a school at Old Crow, and he is in possession of complete figures re school-age children. It should be pointed out that there are also a few half-breed children living in Old Crow. Communication with Old Crow is by radio. During the winter months aircraft fly in there from Aklavik and also from Fort Yukon, Alaska.\n\nUpon receipt of Corp. Kirk's report, I shall submit the information therein contained to you.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nWhitehorse Sub Division\n\nOld Crow Detachment, Y.T.,\nNov. 13th, 1947.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nWhitehorse Sub-Division,\nR.C.M. Police,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\n\nRe: Indian Day School - Old Crow Y.T.\nEnquiries by Indian Agent.\n\nSir:\n\n1. On Nov. 12th a wire was received from Mr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent, Whitehorse, Y.T., as follows:\n   HAVE TEACHER FOR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE POSSIBILTY CONTINUING SCHOOL FROM JANUARY ON STOP\n   HOW MANY CHILDREN WHITE AND INDIAN WHAT SCHOOL FACILITIES\n   AND WHAT LIVING QUARTERS FOR TEACHER\nto which I replied as follows, dated today:\n   RE SCHOOL MATTER TOO LENGTHY FOR FULL DETAILS BY WIRE AM\n   EXPECTING AIRCRAFT WITHIN WEEK WILL AIRMAIL REPORT VIA\n   MY OC\n\nThe following therefore is in response to the above, and may same be expedited please to the agent. It is thought well to be quite lengthy and touch the many angles, so that the Agent will have full details on hand, to assist in his decision.\n\n2. It might be well to remark in beginning; that nine Old Crow children are absent at Carcross School, one at Akleivik School, three (mixed blood) at Dawson Hostel, and two families containing eight children of school age have moved from this district because of the absence of any school facilities here.\n\n3. It would also be well to point out that it is an impossibility for the families to remain in the settlement at some seasons of the year, as they must go far afielde in order to make their living and the whole family moving out with the breadwinner. There are, for instance, only about six children of school age in the settlement at the present moment. Also during the period from mid-April to about June 20th, in each year, there would not be more than one or two children in town unless illness caused any family to remain in any given year, this being the usual spring hunting time for muskrat, the districts' greatest source of income. I have drawn up the following list of the school age children at present in the district, giving the ages, during 1948, of each, his status (Indian otherwise) and the probable time that each will be available for school during 1948. There is also the possibility that some children who are spending the present winter far afielde may be moved into the settlement for next autumn if a school is in existence, the parents planning accordingly. These are noted as possibilities. The list follows:\n\n| WHITES (mixed blood) | Age 1948 | Availability |\n|----------------------|----------|--------------|\n| FROST, Stephen       | 15 Jan. to Apr. July-Aug. doubtful thereafter |\n| FROST, Martha        | 13       |              |\n| FROST, Jno. Albert   | 6        |              |\n| LINKLATER, Robert    | 14       | July to Dec., but has to help earn family living for widowed mother. |\n| LINKLATER, Irvin     | 8 Jan. to Apr. July to Dec. |\n| LINKLATER, Susie     | 6        |              |\n| McDONALD, Norman     | 9 Jan. to Dec. |\n| BRUCE, Bella         | 14 Jan. to April July to Dec. |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 932-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs intimated earlier, the above is an estimation of the availability for school of the children, who total eighteen, during 1943. There is no doubt that the parents are keen to have their children receive schooling. There is no doubt in my mind, that apart from the \"Three Rs\" the discipline will be of great value, for there is practically no parental discipline maintained in the average home.\n\n5. As to a school building, there is a small log building originally built for a school, belonging to the Anglican Mission. However it is small and is cold. It is usable during the spring, summer and autumn, but would be very difficult to heat in the winter. Rev. J.M. Ellis, when he was here, would not use this building in winter for the latter reason; he used a mission building presently occupied by Rev. and Mrs. Kendall as their living quarters, for a school in winter time. Same is of course now not available; however, if a teacher was being sent in during the present winter, the building mentioned in the first sentence of this para. would have to be plastered and fixed to do in a make shift way for this winter, no other being available.\n\n6. With regard to living quarters for a teacher, the only quarters available, is a Mission residence previously occupied by Rev. and Mrs. Ellis, which is at present vacant. This house would be suitable for either a single teacher, or a married couple, and has the advantage that it is completely furnished less blankets, linens, etc. It is supposed that the Dept. could acquire this building from the Anglican Mission. There is no other suitable place for a teacher to live. He, or she, would of course have to \"hatch\". There are only the two married couples (white) in the district, neither of whom would have the room for a boarder, available, and in the case of the writer, we would not have sufficient supplies on hand to permit a boarder.\n\n7. It may hardly be within the scope of the advice required from me, but it is felt that I should mention that living costs at a place like Old Crow are very high, provisions costing approximately double the price of Dawson. And with a school being started in midwinter, depriving the teacher of the ability to purchase outside before next summer, he will be dependent on the Old Crow stores for provisions. Might I suggest therefore that it is most unlikely that the salary paid a teacher would cover the cost of his living here, where living costs are so high by reason of isolation? It would appear fairer for the Dept. to pay the teacher a small salary, and supply him with a given quantity of supplies, his quarters, heat and light in addition thereto. Somewhat similar to our Police system in remote areas.\n\n8. With regard to the transportation into this district during the winter months, of course air is the only method available, and it has occurred to me that possibly if all other difficulties have been overcome, and it is dependent on transportation costs as to whether or not the school is opened, that the whole matter might fold up by reason of the high cost of a plane from Whitehorse to Old Crow. I would point out that the most economical route to Old Crow would be to take any regular method to Fairbanks chartering a plane to Old Crow from that point. It is possible in Fairbanks to charter a small one-passenger plane (carrying very little baggage) to Old Crow for one hundred and twenty five dollars, or larger sized aircraft in proportion up to a Norseman carrying nearly a ton for approximately four hundred and fifty dollars.\n9. The natives are all out of town for the present time, and I am unable to sound any of them out re the school opening, from the point of view of fuel for the school and residence. Fuel is a problem here, especially dry wood. However it is thought that they can be secured to cut wood, and probably the N.C. Co. \"east\" could be secured to haul same. Same would probably be very expensive by reason of the long haul by cat, which would be necessary in the winter.\n\n10. With regard to school supplies, there seems to be quite a sufficient quantity of such supplies as scribblers, drawing books, readers, simple arithmetics, chalk, geographies, etc., to go on with. However, I see no pencils, crayons, or blackboard erasers. It would probably be well to have some of these latter come in with the teacher. There are of course, no proper desks, benches having been used for seats.\n\n11. Some of the points previously brought out will probably indicate that the set up for a school at Old Crow is not too good at present. It will be also apparent that mid-winter is the most difficult time in which to get a school started. None of the difficulties are insurmountable however. As to whether starting the school at this season of added expense would be justified, this will depend on departmental policy, and the type of teachers secured. Should it be intended to secure permanent teachers, and build up a proper day school, and have a permanent day school at Old Crow, by all means get started, for the expense would be warranted. If however, the department should be faced with the possibility of securing teachers, who would come here for a few months experience in the North, or the glamour of it, thus giving Old Crow only a spasmodic school, and under makeshift conditions and buildings, I would opine that the expense thereof would not be warranted by the results secured, and that the whole thing might better be forgotten.\n\n12. With regard to this matter of day schools in the North, might I suggest that consideration be given to the system that the Alaskan native service schools have built up, and it should be mentioned that while numbers of the Alaskan schools are being closed down, it is understood that the Indians are full citizens in Alaska, and that the Federal Govt. wish the Territorial Govt. to assume what is rightly their responsibility, therefore the natives school services were the first curtailment in a huge budget cut during the past year.\n\n13. I have become personally acquainted with several of the Native service teachers in Alaska. It seems that this service usually secures the services of a married couple for a school. Of these married couples, sometimes both hold teachers certificates, but generally the wife is a certificated teacher. She is hired as the teacher, and the husband is hired as maintenance man, often the latter, who is usually a practical type, will furnish annual training. A suitable permanent teachingage is supplied, furnished with heavy furniture. A suitable school is usually adjacent to or if one room, attached to, the residence, as the size of the community warrants. Insofar as I am aware, these schools come under the supervision of the Dept. direct, and are not attached to or operated by any of the various Missions. This system seems to have worked very well, and while I am more closely acquainted with circumstances at Fort Yukon, our closest Alaskan town, the service seems to have always been able to secure teachers, even for such remote spots as Fairbanks, Alaska, on the Arctic Coast, a hundred miles or so from Ft. Barrow. This I would say is more isolated than Old Crow which is the most isolated Yukon village.\n\n14. I would make the points that Old Crow is not a place for a single teacher. With a single male teacher, there is the ever present possibility of entanglement with native girls. It is definitely not a place for a single female teacher, either young or middle aged. Unmarried teachers will never stay for a long period in such isolated places. A suitable married couple will overcome these disadvantages. And for instance, I have personally known three married couples in the Fort Yukon area of Alaska who have spent their lives in the native teaching service. The results obtained at Ft. Yukon itself, by the past two teachers in the past ten years, have been outstanding.\n15. Should the Department be interested in the possibilities outlined in the past three paragraphs, I should be glad to outline what I would consider a suitable school set up for a day school at Old Crow. It is pointed out that should a permanent day school be in operation in Old Crow, that most probably the parents would want their children to return from Carcross etc., thus relieving the overcrowdedness which is understood to exist there. I would consider that if all the Old Crow children were at home, that there would be an average of thirty, probably more, children of school age in the district at all times.\n\n16. To return to the main topic of this report however, the facts as outlined in the foregoing hereof are submitted in the hope they may be of assistance to the Agent in his decision as to whether or not, to start a day school here during January. Should it be decided to start a school, it would be appreciated if the Agent could notify me to this effect as soon as possible. I can then get word to the various families, and can possibly have the natives make some preparation at least.\n\n(signed) Corp. E.A.

Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\n\nOld Crow Indian Day School.\n\nReference yours of January 9 -\n\nWould you please extend my appreciation to Corporal Kirk of the R.C.M.P. for the very excellent report which he submitted on the need for educational facilities at Old Crow. I note that you have sent Archbishop Adams his report. Therefore I am also sending him a copy of this letter so that he will be fully informed.\n\nIndications are that a reasonable forecast of attendance at this school would be as follows:\n\n| Month    | Indians | Non-Indians |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| January  | 3       | 8           |\n| February | 3       | 8           |\n| March    | 3       | 8           |\n| April    | 3       | 8           |\n| May      | 1       | 1           |\n| June     | 4       | 8           |\n| July     | 9       | 8           |\n| August   | 9       | 8           |\n| September| 3       | 5           |\n| October  | 3       | 5           |\n| November | 3       | 5           |\n| December | 3       | 5           |\n\nIt is noted that the attendance would be greatest during the normal summer vacation. Therefore it has been suggested that\nwe could experiment by having either a territorial school teacher or one of our own Indian school teachers go into Old Crow to spend the vacation teaching there. It is quite possible that we could devise a \"swing shift\" system for a teacher for this and other schools in your agency. I would appreciate your comments on the above proposals and any suggestions along similar lines.\n\nBernard F.

Funds will be available for salary as from April first, next. I would suggest that, in due time, you nominate the services of a qualified nurse-school teacher for this point and inform the Department fully concerning the name, age, qualifications and experience.\n\nI note you have arranged to have Philip Joseph, an ex-pupil of the Carcross Indian Residential School, conduct classes at Old Crow during the present winter months and that he will carry on the work under the direct supervision of the wife of the Corporal of the Mounted Police stationed at that point, who is a fully qualified teacher. Regarding your request that a grant be provided towards his salary during the period he teaches this school, I would say that the Department will allow the sum of $2.50 per teaching day. This will be paid upon receipt of a return, showing the attendance and the actual number of days taught by him up to the end of March, next. As our funds during the present fiscal year are limited, this is the full grant we can provide in payment for Philip Joseph's services. I would request that you have him prepare the return, stating definitely the number of days he taught, and forward same to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

McCabe, I would point out that $600.00 of the amount is paid from the Vote for Indian Education. In order to do this, she is classified as a teacher, and, as our usual system is to pay on the basis of ten months of the academic year, she will be allowed salary as teacher at the rate of $60.00 a month for ten months.\n\nOn receipt of the return for the quarter ended September 30, 1937, it was found that the school had been open for the months of June, August and September and, consequently, $180.00 was sent to her. A similar amount was paid at the end of December, and we are issuing another cheque for the March quarter for the same sum. This will mean that since July first, 1937, she has been paid $540. Therefore, when her June quarter return is received, it will only be possible to allow her $60.00, which is the balance of the amount provided for her services as teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

I regret that no payment can be made for the first-mentioned period as this occurred in the fiscal year 1941-42 for which period our books are closed. We will, however, issue a cheque for the period the school was open during the September quarter, 1942. The return states that the school was in operation for 39 days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Jeckell,\nIndian agent,\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nDear Mr. Jeckell:\n\nIn compliance with Chapter 98, Part 1, No. 10 of the revised Statutes of Canada requiring that \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic School or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices; and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\"; and at the request of their Excellencies our Bishops Dunoz and Coudeur, I opened a day school at Teslin last summer for our Catholic children.\n\nSchool opened June the 13th, immediately after the Indians came to the Town and closed September the 25th. Attendance at school was very good. 16 Catholic children between the ages of six and sixteen came to school regularly and 4 above sixteen years of age came to school quite often. We had to buy all our school supplies for this first summer school.\n\nAs I am in residence at Teslin, I expect to have a summer school every year for our Catholic children and we would appreciate very much the help of the Indian Department in our school work.\n\nWould you kindly let me know if the Indian Department would grant our school supplies for the summer 1942. You will find here enclosed a list of all the items needed for our school.\n\nA new census has been taken last summer and you can see that a good half of the Indian population living at Teslin is Catholic. Others are under Instruction - so I am confident that the Indian Department will help us in our school work.\n\nThanking you for your kindness to us in the past, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Father A. Drea, O.M.I.\nTeslin Lake.\nDAWSON, Y.T. January 21, 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Reverend Father A. Dream, C.M.I., of Teslin Lake, Yukon Territory, which contains a request that the Indian Affairs Branch recognize the summer Day School which is being conducted by Father Dream for Roman Catholic Indian Children at Teslin Post, Yukon Territory.\n\nFather Dream states that a day school was opened at Teslin last summer for Catholic children. The school was opened on June 13th and closed September 25th. Eighteen Catholic children between the ages of six and sixteen attended regularly. Father Dream states that he is in residence at Teslin and is prepared to conduct a summer school every year for Catholic children.\n\nI would ask for favourable consideration for this application for assistance. The customary grant should be made and school supplies should be furnished. A Day School has been conducted at Teslin by the Anglican Church, and the same favourable consideration should be given for a Roman Catholic Day School.\n\nOwing to the fact that mail communications with Teslin Post are irregular, particularly in the winter time, I would ask that you communicate the decision of the Department direct to Right Reverend Bishop Coudert, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A. Jeckell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant enclosing copy of letter received from Rev. A. Dream, O.M.I., regarding the Indian seasonal school which he intends to conduct at Teslin Lake during the summer of 1942.\n\nThe whole question of administering seasonal schools in the Stikine Agency and surrounding territory is now under review by Indian Commissioner MacKay, Vancouver. This was requested by a recent report received from Mr. Coleman, Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, who visited the seasonal schools in the Stikine Agency during the past summer. Until a definite decision is reached regarding the policy which we should follow in regard to seasonal schools in the north country, the Department is not prepared to recognize any new seasonal schools to the extent of allowing any salary to the teacher. However, we are willing to assist by supplying some school supplies and an order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office. It is not our intention to allow all the articles requested by Father Dream, nor in the quantities that he apparently desires, as it is considered that his requests are excessive in some particulars.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.A.

I promised to submit this for the Minister's consideration and this is being done. However, until the Order-in-Council is passed the school cannot be officially recognized.

Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nStikine Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nApril 29, 1944.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies for B.C.\n\nYour 1941 Inspection Report instructed that the question of another seasonal school under Roman Catholic auspices being established at Teslin Lake be investigated and reported on. Owing to the disturbed condition of affairs at Teslin Lake since the advent of the Alaska Highway and Teslin Airport it was considered advisable to wait until things became more settled before attempting to report the situation. On my last visit to Teslin in January the Indians appear to be resuming their former occupations gradually but a complete return to normal is not yet evident. This naturally affects any proposal of creating new seasonal schools.\n\nConditions have been watched during the past two years and it now appears that the R.C. Mission at Teslin has given up the idea of opening a school at Johnstown and have been carrying on a day school at Teslin Post, Yukon, at which both Yukon and B.C. Indian children attend. The Department is apparently paying $3.00 per teaching day for an indefinite length term to the Rev. Father Dream, C.M.I., for conducting the school. I understand that the Anglican mission also receives a similar allowance for the operation of their day school. The attendance is about equally divided between the schools.\n\nAs the majority of the Teslin Indians are Yukon membership arrangements concerning these schools are evidently all handled through the Indian Agent at Dawson for no official word has come to this office. Bishop Coucort of Whitehorse recently informed that Ottawa had authorized the construction of an R.C. day school, probably seasonal, at Teslin Post but this office has no official knowledge of it.\n\nA further report will be submitted next July on my return from Teslin Lake when I will have had a further opportunity to obtain the most recent details of the situation at first hand.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to your letter of April 26, 1941, file 183-10-1, with reference to Indian Agent Harper Reed's report regarding school matters in the Teslin Lake area in the Stikine Agency.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Sampson's report on the subject dated the 28th ultimo which appears to dispose of the matter other than that I would appreciate advice as to whether Bishop Coudert was informed that the Department had authorized the construction of a Roman Catholic School at Teslin Post.\n\nIt is expected that a further report on the matter will be received from Mr. Sampson after his July visit to the area in question.\n\nD.M.

Last February we sent you certain forms to complete, but you returned them stating that your only salary was the amount you were receiving for teaching the seasonal school at Teslin Lake. Since that time a new form has been prepared and, in view of the statement in your previous letter, we feel that you come under Class C. However, we must have the enclosed form completed, as otherwise the Treasury Office has no alternative than to deduct for income tax. I am delaying payment for the period you have already taught until this form is returned to us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A. Drean, O.M.I.,\nTeacher,\nR.C.

Father Drean, the teacher, told me that he has sent the School Reports to the Branch as requested, after the School was duly approved by an Act in Council, but so far he has received no salary.\n\nA new building was erected for the school in the early part of last Summer, and according to the testimony of Mr.Jeckell, the Controller for the Yukon, it is the best building for such purposes to be found in the indian camps of the Yukon. An expenditure of well over $1000.00 was made by the church in connection with said building, without counting our labor.\n\nThe Rev.Father A.Drean O.M.I. will again be teaching at said school this coming Summer, if the appointment is agreeable to the Department.\n\nYours very sincerely in Christ\n\nBishop J.L.Coudert O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse\nOttawa, March 8, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the Teslin Lake R.C. School. In this connection I enclose, for your information, copy of our letter of August 25, 1944, to Reverend Father Dreaan, to which no reply has been received. At that time we forwarded Father Dreaan T.D.IA forms. Owing to present regulations it is necessary to have these completed before paying the salary to Father Dreaan, due to the fact that if these forms are not received here present regulations require deduction for income tax. I enclose two copies of the form. It would be appreciated if you would have Father Dreaan complete and return these to us at the earliest possible date. As soon as this is done, the amount of salary due him for last year will be paid.\n\nWe have received from Father Dreaan a return showing that he conducted the Teslin Lake R.C. School for 7 days in June, 1944, and 20 days in July, 1944. From this it would appear that he taught the school for 27 days. Possibly he taught it for a longer period and, if so, another return should be forwarded for the period he taught the school in August or subsequent months. If this information is supplied, together with the T.D.IA forms, there will be no further delay in paying him the amount due him. Your kind attention to this request will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse,\nBishop's Residence,\nP.O. Box 95, Whitehorse, Y.T.\nMarch 17, 1945\n\nPhilip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter dated March 8 inst. was forwarded here recently and came to my knowledge yesterday. I immediately referred the matter to Mr. G.A. Jeckell, Inspector of Income Tax, stating that I myself had advised Father A. Dreen last February that he was not obliged to complete the forms your Office had sent him regarding Income Tax; we took it as granted that such forms had been sent in as mere routine, and as they did not apply in his case, it was useless to have them filled; I am under the impression that such was also the advice given to him by the local Police Authorities.\n\nThe Inspector of Income Tax for the Territory confirmed my decision and told me that as a religious organization whose members have no personal money, he could not understand why such forms would be sent to our teachers, when said teachers are members of our Religious Congregation, as is the case for all the teachers of our Seasonal Indian Schools in my diocese.\n\nI am returning, however, your forms which I have filled, after taking advice of the Inspector of Income Tax, to the best of my abilities, in the name of Father A. Dreen, who could not easily be reached at such a time... As no class mentioned on the form applied, I had to add in the margin a special note which, I hope, will be found satisfactory, so that the payment of the promised salary to the Catholic Indian School at Teslin for June and July 1944 may not be further delayed.\n\nI am writing to Father Dreen immediately asking him to complete his report, if he has not yet done so.\n\nI understand that the Teslin School is paid by day and not by month, as are the other Seasonal Schools of my diocese, such as Klappan, Dease Lake and McDame.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nJ.L.

I am sorry that our letters did not reach you. This may be explained by the fact that having the mail here only twice a month we give our letters to be posted in Whitehorse to friends passing by on the \"Highway\". The letter probably was never posted.\n\nLast summer, we kept the school opened during the months of June, July and August. I did not send you the monthly report of August because the attendance...\nwas poor. Most of our children went on the hills with their parents to pick wild berries.\n\nI am including the report of the first days of August.\n\nAs I mentioned it previously, the attendance at school last summer was not very regular, because we had the school opened during the winter months and the children who attended school during the winter months were not very anxious to attend school again during the summer.\n\nBut such has not been the case this winter; so this summer we expect to keep the school opened at least three months.\n\nIII. In a previous letter I asked you to send me some forms for my monthly reports; a regular book for the attendance at school and proper forms for school supplies. Your kind attention to these requests will be very much appreciated.\n\nIV. For the last three years, I bought all the supplies I needed for the school.\nNow new supplies are badly needed. Would you kindly let me know if I can get the supplies I need for this summer from the Indian Department. I would appreciate an early reply on this matter so as to give me time to order the supplies needed.\n\nA new building was erected for the school in the early part of last summer. This building is estimated at $4,000 dollars. A rent of $15.00 or $25.00 dollars a month would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nFather G.

Henry - Je vous ai \u00e9crit \u00e0 vous. La situation ici devient pas mal critique. L'Agent indien demande aux Indiens de rester au poste pour emmener leurs enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole... Le r\u00e9sultat est que nos Indiens sont dans la mis\u00e8re... Les Indiens restent ici... Ils ne savent pas la faire... Quelques-uns travaillent du temps du bois ici ou l\u00e0... Mais il y a bien peu de travail pour eux... Il est bien rare qu'il se passe un jour sans qu'un Indien ou l'autre ne vienne \u00e0 la mission pour essayer d'enfumer de l'argent... Si cela continue nos Indiens qui \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s bons chasseurs vont devenir une bande de mendicants... De plus si nos enfants sont forc\u00e9s d'aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole publique, cela va tuer notre \u00e9cole d'\u00e9t\u00e9...\n\nSi nous avions notre \u00e9cole fonctionnel, il n'y aurait plus tant de difficult\u00e9s...

Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 21st regarding suspension of Family Allowances to Effie and Kitty Jule. This was done pursuant to the Family Allowances Act which states that if a child is absent for more than five days without reasonable excuse, Family Allowances must be suspended. Miss Clancy tells me she warned the children who were absent concerning this. We had no alternative but to suspend Allowances. I might add that we were instructed on this policy by C.A.F. Clark who visited here some two months ago.\n\nThe Teslin School is known as a Joint School, and is not conducted under religious auspices, but directly under the supervision of the Territorial Government. Indian affairs provide the school and teacherage and certain classroom material. It is designed to accommodate Indians and whites who are resident in Teslin.\n\nMy understanding of Summer or Seasonal Schools is that they are for children who cannot attend day school by reason of being with their parents on the trap-line. They are, as you point out, entirely under religious supervision. A much greater latitude is given to these schools for obvious reasons. The Indian Act does not state that they are obliged to attend Summer School when they have already attended Day School. However, as you have written to Col. Neary I feel he will issue a ruling on this matter for future guidance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(R.J.

Il nous suffit de la lire pour savoir de quoi il s'agit. Lors de votre passage ici, il y aura deux ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9, je vous ai dit qu'une \u00e9cole publique \u00e9tait sur le point de s'ouvrir \u00e0 Tehli pour les blancs, les m\u00e9tis et les indiens qui restent autour de Tehli durant l'hiver. Nous avons 8 enfants qui vont \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole en ce moment. Je voudrais bien savoir si l'Agent indien peut forcer nos enfants catholiques d'aller \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole publique. Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent j'ai laiss\u00e9 faire... Mais quand il en vient \u00e0 des sanctions, je crois qu'il est temps de clarifier la situation.\n\nSi l'Agent indien peut forcer nos enfants catholiques d'aller \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole publique, j'attendrai \u00e0 notre \u00e9cole d'\u00eatre bien faite.

Veuillez aussi, si la chose est possible, \u00e0 quelles directions bien claires seront donn\u00e9es \u00e0 notre Agent indien ou \u00e0 quelles sanctions ne soient pas appliqu\u00e9es contre des enfants qui font de leur mieux pour aller \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole \u00e0 longueur d'ann\u00e9e...\n\nJe vous offre mes meilleures voeux et souhaits de joyeux No\u00ebl et de bonne et sainte ann\u00e9e.\n\nBien fraternellement,\n\nAlbert Duncan\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 933-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTeslin Lake - Yukon\nDec 12th 1949\n\nTo A.J. Week\nWhitehorse - Yukon\nIndian Agency\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter to Sandy Trox, dated Dec 5th, was delivered to him today. By this letter, I came to the knowledge that you have recommended the stop of family allowances to Effie and Kitty Jule, because they missed too many school days. You must know that Effie and Kitty Jule are Roman Catholic and that as Catholics, they must attend the Catholic summer school at Teslin. The Indian Act is very clear on this matter.\n\nEffie and Kitty Jule attended the public school last winter; they attended the Catholic summer school and now they are still going to the public school and because they...\nmoved too many school days you recommend their family allowances to be cut off...\n\nI do not think that these children can be forced to go to school 12 months of the year. Furthermore, I doubt that these children, being catholic, can be forced to attend the public school when the Government has established a school for them here during the summer.\n\nI am reporting this matter to His Excellency the Bishop, and I am also writing to Ottawa.\n\nI like to see these children go to school; I encouraged them to do so because our summer school is much too short.... But it is a matter of principle... and I think the fact that they attended the catholic summer school should have been taken into consideration.\nYours Truly,\n\nFather G.

If Mr. Jule wishes to have his children continue to attend the Teslin Joint School, you should secure from him an affidavit certifying that he wishes his children to continue to attend this school.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Superintendent Meek has a copy of this report and he may be alluding to it in his letter of December 27 to Reverend Father Drean. The Teslin question, however, had not arisen at the time of my discussions with Mr. Superintendent Meek.\n\nI do not recall having advised Mr. Meek that some clergymen would have the children of their denomination stay away from school entirely rather than attend a school that is not conducted under denominational auspices. Reverend Father Drean appears to be a clergyman of this type.\n\nMr. Superintendent Meek's action in attempting to enforce attendance may have its origin in your letter of June 25, 1949, in which you agree that \"it would not be practical to operate the Teslin Seasonal School in view of the fact that we are now cooperating with the Yukon Territory in the operation of a joint school\". I can not think that it would occur to Mr. Superintendent Meek or to Mr. School Inspector Hulland or, indeed, to any Yukon official that in the circumstances...\nwe would operate a seasonal school for any denomination. The development of the Roman Catholic White school at Whitehorse may serve to acquaint these gentlemen with the philosophy of denominational education.\n\nI note that the present teacher at Teslin is a Miss Clancy and that no information is given concerning her religious affiliation which, of course, ought not to be a consideration, interest or influence in a non-sectarian school. She seems to regard the local children primarily as candidates for instruction in the school curriculum and probably considers that the non-attendance of the Jule children is a disturbing factor on the other pupils. We are not informed where these Jule children spend most of their time. Reverend Father Drean suggests that they ought to be on the trapping grounds but very likely they are hanging around the post most of the time. Reverend Father Drean says \"Other parents are sending their children to the Territorial school and making the real sacrifice of staying here instead of being on their trapping grounds where they could live much better, until better provisions can be made for their children. I am afraid (sic) new adjustments will have to be made then and without prejudice.\" From this statement it is a fair deduction that Reverend Father Drean will follow a course designed to eliminate all Indian pupils from this school as it is obvious that he hopes to persuade \"other parents\" to his way of thinking.\n\nAccording to a religious census prepared in 1939, Charlie Jule was regarded as Roman Catholic. At that time Effie Jule was three years old and Katie four months. Unless the father has changed his affiliation in the meantime, an affidavit would be required only if he wished his children to attend the Teslin Joint School. If he is still a Roman Catholic no affidavit is required if he wants to keep his children away.\n\nOn the other hand Peter Sydney is the child of Anglican parents and the Reverend Father Drean is out of court in\nclaiming that he should not attend Teslin School. In this case if exemption from attendance is desired an affidavit is necessary. The danger is that the \"other parents\" may also seek to exempt their children. In that case the existence of the joint school must be brief.\n\nI suggest that Mr. Superintendent Meek be requested to supply the following information:\n\n(1) To what religious denomination does Charlie Jule now adhere?\n\n(2) The same question for the parents of Peter Sydney.\n\n(3) Do the three children live at the Teslin settlement most of the time?\n\nIt also seems necessary to decide whether a Roman Catholic Seasonal School should be operated at Teslin.\n\nC.A.F.

I am afraid (sic) new adjustments will have to be made then and without prejudice.\" From this statement it is a fair deduction that Reverend Father Drea will follow a course designed to eliminate all Indian pupils from this school as it is obvious that he hopes to persuade \"other parents\" to his way of thinking.\n\nAccording to a religious census prepared in 1939, Charlie Jule was regarded as Roman Catholic. At that time Effie Jule was three years old and Katie four months. Unless the father has changed his affiliation in the meantime, an affidavit would be required only if he wished his children to attend the Teslin Joint School. If he is still a Roman Catholic no affidavit is required if he wants to keep his children away.\n\nOn the other hand Peter Sydney is the child of Anglican parents and the Reverend Father Drea is out of court in\nclaiming that he should not attend Teslin School. In this case if exemption from attendance is desired an affidavit is necessary. The danger is that the \"other parents\" may also seek to exempt their children. In that case the existence of the joint school must be brief.\n\nI suggest that Mr. Superintendent Meek be requested to supply the following information:\n\n(1) To what religious denomination does Charlie Jule now adhere?\n\n(2) The same question for the parents of Peter Sydney.\n\n(3) Do the three children live at the Teslin settlement most of the time?\n\nIt also seems necessary to decide whether a Roman Catholic Seasonal School should be operated at Teslin.\n\nC.A.F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nEnclosed please find correspondence exchanged between your agent Mr. Meek and Father A. Dr\u00e9an, regarding the efforts of the former to oblige the Jule children to attend the Territorial school at Teslin.\n\nJudging from the tone of Father Dr\u00e9an's letters, both to myself and to Mr. Meek, it would seem that the latter has adopted a line of conduct which is very much at variance with that of most of your agents. It seems to me that something ought to be done to bring peace and harmony between him and the authorities of the Church.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nN.B. Would you be good enough to return the correspondence after you have read it.\n\nJ.O. P.\nTeslin Lake - April 12th 1950\n\nDear Father Plourde -\n\nOur Indian Agent in Whitehorse, Mr. R. J. Weck, is still trying to force the Inuit children in the Territorial school at Teslin. They did not get their family allowances since December. Mr. R. J. Weck, still told our game warden a few days ago, that the Inuit children are not getting their family allowances because they are not going to the Territorial school.... It becomes a real persecution.\n\nI am sending you the last letter I received from Mr. Weck and my answer to the same. As you can see, Mr. Weck is all against the transfer of Pete Sidney who is taking lessons to become a Catholic from one school to another; But at the same time he is doing all he can, even depriving them of their family allowances, to transfer the Inuit children who spent all their life in Catholic schools either in Grouard or here, into another school. The man is so prejudiced that he cannot even see that he is...\nMr. Weck has done the same thing to get many Catholic children in the free school in Whitehorse.\n\nTo put an end to this persecution of the Jule family, I am wondering if it would not be possible to have the family allowance of this family paid directly by cheque from Ottawa. Many others are receiving their family allowances by cheque.\n\nMr. Weck never answered my letter written February the 24th. I am sending you a copy of it in case it might be useful.\n\nHoping to hear from you in the near future,\n\nI remain Maternally Yours\n\nFather A. Dream O.M.I.\nFr. A. Dream, O.M.I.,\nTeslin, Y.T.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe action on your part of taking away the Jule children from the Territorial school created certain problems which necessitated a considerable amount of writing to and from Ottawa. Col. Neary has replied, and I attach hereto a copy of a ruling given by Duncan Scott in 1922. I particularly draw your attention to the last paragraph. Col. Neary ends his letter with this statement:\n\n\"You can appreciate, therefore, the need for a short affidavit, taken in your presence, and relating to the wishes of the father with regard to attendance at both day and residential schools.\"\n\nWe have run into the same difficulty at both Whitehorse and Carcross Residential Schools. In a case similar to that of Pete Sidney which you mention, Col. Neary, in a letter written August 24th 1949, states:\n\n\"The transfer of young Indian children from one educational institution to another entails various adjustments which are not easy for such children to make, and failure to make them is likely to produce undesirable results. The change suggested for these children will, therefore, not be authorized at this time. It is considered, moreover, that as long as there are said to be children in your Agency who are not regularly attending any school, existing schools should draw their enrolment from such children rather than seek to enrol children for whom adequate arrangements have already been made.\"\n\nI gather from the foregoing instructions to me, that Pete Sidney will remain at Teslin School. As to the Jules, an affidavit is required by the father.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(R.J. Meek) Superintendent.\nTeshin Lake - Y.T.\nFeb. 24th 1950\n\nMr. K. J. Webb\nIndian Agency\nWhitehorse\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of February the 21st received yesterday and the attached copy of a ruling given by Duncan Scott in 1922.\n\nI absolutely reject your accusation of taking the Juk Children from the Territorial school at Teshin, and if such accusation was made by you to anyone, I would kindly ask you to withdraw it. I did not take the Juk Children from the Territorial school and I never told Charlie Juk, nor any other person for that matter, to withdraw their children from the said school. I did not believe I had authority to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, I know for a fact that strong pressure was used, last year, and even threats made, to get Charlie Juk's children and other children in the Territorial school. I heard of these threats and still never said a word pro or con.\nIt was only when I came to the knowledge, by one of your letters to Sandy Fox, that the family allowance of Effie and Killa Jule had been suspended and when Charlie Jule himself, had decided, in protest, to withdraw his children from the Territorial school, that I entered the picture, for their protection, because I did not believe the sanction fair. These children attended the summer school provided for them before they went to Grouard, and since they came back from Grouard, and they were being forced in the Territorial school board, against their wishes and against the wishes of their Parents.\n\nOther parents are sending their children to the Territorial school and making the real sacrifice of staying here instead of being on their trapping grounds where they could live much better, until better provisions can be made for their children. I am afraid new adjustments will have to be made then and without prejudice. At least it is the desire of the parents and I am sure the Department of Indian Affairs will do them justice.\n\nAbout the Jule children, Col. Shary has replied that an affidavit is required by the Fathers.\nIn other words: Charlie Jule and his wife are Roman Catholics, their children are Roman Catholics, therefore these children must go to a Roman Catholic school, unless Charlie Jule signs an affidavit to the contrary, which affidavit must not be forced upon them by threats.... Duncan Scott says: \"... And the person who takes such affidavit must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same.\"\n\nThe affidavit has been signed by Charlie Jule.... and still sanctions are taken against the children. Do you believe this fair and just?\n\nOrders were given to Gordon Ireland, storekeeper for Taylor and Dury at Teslin, in a letter dated Feb 15th, to reduce Mr. Charlie Jule's family allowance from $35.00 dollars to $21.00 dollars, starting the 1st of March.\n\nI took a copy of that letter and sent it to Ottawa.\n\nI am sorry this dispute had to happen. When Indian Department authorities and Religious Authorities should cooperate and work together for the settlement and the welfare of the Indians.\nBut I had no choice in the matter.\nHoping this will lead us to a better understanding of the situation and of each other's opinions.\n\nI am\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 933-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nP.C.B.95, Whitehorse,Y.T.\n\nMay 10, 1950\n\nColonel Bernard F.

Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse,\nP.O. Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nWe received your letter of the 10th ultimo regarding the Teslin, Lower Post and Ross River Seasonal Schools.\n\nI enclose a supply of TD 1 forms which you should have completed and returned as soon as possible for Father Turenne and for the teacher at the Ross River Seasonal School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST Enc.\n\nAIR MAIL\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nWhitehorse Indian School:\n\nFrom Fort St. John I made an unannounced visit to Whitehorse and viewed the activities at this school (art classes excepted) on the morning of Thursday, Nov. 3 and on Friday, Nov. 4. As the art teacher is at this school only the first three days of each week, I had to have an evening discussion with her. I think we may be confident that the children will benefit from her teaching. I gave her one copy of \"Good Health for Canada's Indians\" and suggested that she might combine her technical ability and increasing familiarity with Indians to produce similar useful illustrated booklets.\n\nMay fifty copies (or more, if available) of the named booklet be sent to the Whitehorse School, please, and may the issue to all our schools in the Yukon be confirmed.\n\nIn the three divisions I counted an attendance of 95:\n\n| Mr. Earl Lee | Grades IV V VI VII VIII Total |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| Pupils       | 1 8 2 2 1 14                 |\n\nMiss Patterson\n\n| II III       |\n|--------------|\n| 18 22        |\n|              |\n| 40           |\n\nMrs. Weigand\n\nPrimary (incl. over-age beginners)\n\nThe school should be requested to submit age-sex-grade tables for Indian and non-Indian pupils as at Dec. 31, 1949. This is, perhaps, the most significant date. So many of our schools this year seem to be hoping for \"filled accommodation by Christmas.\"\n\nOf the absentees among the day pupils, the attendance of two (Joan Charlie and Betty Shakoos) seems particularly unsatisfactory.\n\nAll pupils were seated at large tables on backless forms usually four to a form. As they use only one side of a table so as to face the front of the room, the tables in two rooms are quite close together, and the inner children on each form have difficulty extricating themselves to go to the blackboard or elsewhere. The height of the tables suits only some of the pupils. The desks now on order have more appropriate sizes but there will be only eighty of them. I have asked Mr. Supt. Meek to request your instructions concerning a shipment of desks which are not all needed at Mayo.\n\nAs these classrooms still retain the army pattern of fenestration, the teachers must be alert to ensure good ventilation. Heating is by stoves in each room. The lighting fixtures are adequate, in some cases fluorescent having been installed.\n\nYou have received completed forms showing the teachers' training and experience. All classes and rooms show that a trained person is in charge. Mrs. Weigand has given her former pupils a good start; Miss Patterson contributes the most missionary zeal, and Mr. Lee brings interest and vigour to the handling of physical education. In this he is aided by our agency clerk, Mr. McDonald, and now by the army authorities.\nwho grant the use of a hall once a week. A rink is being made ready near the school.\n\nAs Mrs. Weigand has 48 pupils registered some adjustment of the teaching loads might be made if Miss Wallinger, when available, is added to the staff without displacing one of the present teachers.\n\nThere are in the Yukon more pupils who should be in school, and pressure will continue to be exerted by parents upon the Superintendent to have children admitted to the Rev. Mr. Lee's hostel when according to the Indian Act they belong in schools conducted under other denominational auspices. In an area where the public schools are by statute or custom non-sectarian some people are likely to be unaware or forgetful of the special provisions regarding Indian education, but ecclesiastical influences will be quick to challenge any admissions of children who have any history of affiliation with other branches of the Church. I emphasize the need of close attention to this matter because another building has recently been acquired by the Rev. Mr. Lee - additional to the one in which the hostel was started last year.\n\nThe latest addition includes a former army mess-hall and kitchen which compares very favourably with similar installations in our residential schools. There were eighty-eight pupils present at meal-time, and there could be room made for another thirty. The well-equipped kitchen (oil-burning stove) is in charge of Miss Ruth Sponholz who does a good job, including bread-making. She has previous experience in institutions. The walk-in refrigerator, well-stocked with moose meat which only Indian Hospitals and Indian schools in the Yukon may buy from Indians, is an impressive feature.\n\nHouse-keeping chores receive attention from the pupils outside of regular school hours. As most of the staff come from Alberta, they have some acquaintance with procedures in dormitories conducted in connection with consolidated schools.\n\nThe sleeping accommodation is plain but acceptable; the sanitary facilities likewise. Local inspection authorities appear to keep a good watch on the place. Health services in Whitehorse have been reinforced.\n\nThere is a small laundry with some machinery, most of the work apparently done by women on the staff.\n\nThe future of this experiment is not altogether clear. There cannot be much profit over operating costs, looking to inevitable heavy maintenance and repair. It might be wiped out by fire, or the owners of the land might cease for possession thereof. The town looks forward to replacing its own schools, but admission thereto of Indians seems unlikely. The Roman Catholic school which Bishop Cou\u00ebt graciously invited me to visit (it now has three rooms excellently adapted in a former army building) restricts attendance to white children.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Calgary.

Apparently the shipment comprising two parcels was forwarded prepaid, but upon arrival at Whitehorse was relayed by Air into Teslin and the Yukon Southern Air Transport charges were collected from the missionary.\n\nFather Dream has forwarded the receipted account and asked to be reimbursed for the amount of this outlay, namely $9.80. I enclose the account here-with with my recommendation.\n\nFor your information, school supplies going into outlying districts in the Yukon Territory should be sent in early summer. In many instances transportation can then be completed by water at a considerable saving of expense. For instance the transportation charges from Whitehorse by boat are only 3\u00bd a pound as against 20\u00bd a pound by Air.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept't. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRev. A. Drean, O.M.I., teacher of the Teslin Catholic Indian Seasonal School has asked if the Department will supply desks for the pupils. There are 24 pupils on the Roll, and the desks required will be: 12 small; 8 medium; 4 large. The cost will be approximately $350.00 delivered to Teslin Post, Y.T. They should be shipped out of Vancouver or Prince Rupert, B.C. by C.P.R. coastal steamer to Skagway, Alaska, thence by the W.P. & Y.R. railroad to Whitehorse, Y.T., and addressed to Rev. Drean in care of Bishop J.L. Coucier, O.M.I., Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nThe Catholic school building at Teslin is well constructed and nicely finished. The school-room is large, well lighted, and has good ventilation. I feel that it is deserving of good equipment, but at the same time it is realized that the outlay is considerable for a three month term school. The desks now in use are made of rough lumber, are uncomfortable and certainly not conducive to proper posture.\n\nIt is understood that it may not be possible to obtain desks at this time owing to shortage, but I am anxious to know if the Department is agreeable to supplying them.\n\nR.H.S.

T.,\nJuly 22, 1944.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Burwash Landing.\n\nWhen at Burwash Landing, Yukon Territory, on July 8, I was approached by Father E. Morisset, who has recently entered that area.\n\nHe wishes to open a Day School this fall, and at present is busy arranging for accommodation. He hopes to be able to open the school in September and states that there are in the district about fifteen children of school age, the oldest being fourteen years old, who have had absolutely no schooling. He enquired of me whether it would be possible to obtain school supplies from the Department. He did not particularize his needs, but I venture to suggest that the Department will be familiar with the type of material required for elementary instruction of this type of pupil.\n\nJ. E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. J.E. Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the desire of Reverend E. Morisset to open a school at Burwash Landing, Yukon Territory.\n\nIt is noted that Father Morisset only requests some school supplies. These could, of course, be provided, but our experience is that once this is done we receive a request shortly afterwards for teacher's salary and rent of building, furnishings etc. Consequently before giving official approval to the opening of this school the Department would appreciate some additional information. We would like to have the name of the town or village closest to Burwash Landing and the approximate distance from Dawson. Is this group of Indians nomadic, or do they reside throughout the year at Burwash? If they are permanently located at Burwash you might let me know in what manner they obtain their living. What building does Father Morisset intend to use for school purposes and will he be able to conduct the school for the usual five days a week, both in winter and summer? If not, you should state the exact length of time which he considers the school will be in operation during each year.\n\nOn receipt of your reply to this letter the request will have further consideration.\n\nR.A.

Father Eusebe Morisset O.M.I is the school teacher.\n\nI beg to have said school recognized by the Branch and father Morisset approved as the official school teacher.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop J.L.

The Department is prepared to give very careful consideration to your request in this regard, but we would appreciate some additional information before making a final decision.\n\nIn July, 1944, Indian Agent Gibben advised us that he had received a letter from the Reverend Father Morisset, requesting authority to open a school at Burwash. For your information, I enclose a copy of an air mail letter sent to Mr. Gibben on August 4. He replied to that letter but stated that he had written to Father Morisset, asking for detailed information. No further communication has been received.\n\nI feel certain that you will be in a position to supply us with the information requested in our letter to the Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. J. L. Coudert, C.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse,\nBishop's Residence,\nBox 95, Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 934-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 17, 1945\n\nPhilip Phelan  \nChief Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Indian Day School at Burwash\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI wish to thank you for your encouraging answer regarding the approval of our Indian Day School at Burwash.\n\nThe reason why Father E. Morisset did not reply at once to Mr. J.E. Gibben, Indian Agent, was not due to neglect, but on the contrary to the desire of knowing exactly the situation before making a formal application to the Department; it was a new experiment in a part of the country where previously no winter school had ever been conducted; the experiments made in connection with summer schools at that point had been complete failure; we were urgently requested both by the white and indian population to come into that new field; It must be well understood by the Officials of the Department that our work is still in the experimental stage, and this is the reason why I instructed Father E. Morisset to apply for text books only and school supplies but not yet for salary.\n\nMy letter of March let was not intended, therefore, as yet to claim a salary to which, I perfectly well know, our teacher is not entitled to; it was intended to prepare the ground for a formal recognition of the school for the school year 1946-1946; by next summer, Father E. Morisset should be in a good position to report accurately on his experiments and on the kind of school he may safely conduct. After the kind of day schools we have seen conducted in such places as Carmacks and Fort Selkirk (which are apparently tolerated by the Branch) we feel absolutely certain that the kind of school we hope to be able to conduct at Burwash will meet the full approval of the Branch.\n\nHere are, for your information, some data concerning the Burwash School, pending the more accurate information Father Morisset intends to send you at a later date.\n\nThe School is located in the Burwash Settlement, between the Store and the Indian Village; the Indians of Burwash have good houses, cleaner and better kept, as an average, than the houses of most Indian Camps of the Yukon; they are of the proper Indian stock and are related to the White River Indians; they are all good trappers and hustlers; they seem to reside permanently at Burwash during January, February and a part of March, and again during the whole summer season; some of them even leave their families at Burwash permanently as they are quite close to their trapping grounds. All are anxious to give an education to their children and would be willing to let them board with us, when they are out on their trapping work, if we had accommodation for the children. We have four substantial log buildings with a cement cellar under the buildings; all the buildings are connected together; two are already completed inside with plywood and are quite comfortable; they are the best buildings in the Burwash Settlement.\n\nI will instruct Father E. Morisset to provide you with the additional information you may need before making your final decision.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\nJ.L. Couderc O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse\nP.O.B.35\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 934-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 6, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to your request for the establishment of a school at Burwash. The information contained in your letter has been carefully noted and I observe, in the last paragraph, that Father E. Morisset is willing to supply additional information.\n\nI trust that Father Morisset will find it possible to write to us in the near future as we have to obtain an Order-in-Council authorizing the establishment of the school, and this requires time. I am particularly interested in knowing exactly how many children would be available. In your letter of March 1 you stated that 14 pupils had attended the school which you operated last summer. I am anxious to know if the number mentioned comprises all the children that are available. I understand from your letter that only a seasonal day school is necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. J. L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse,\nBishop's Residence,\nDawson, Yukon\nDawson, Y. T.,\nMarch 29, 1945.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Proposed Indian Day School,\nBurwash Landing, Y. T.\n\nReference to previous correspondence will show that Father E. Morrisett, O.M.I., requested a supply of school books for this school, which he was at that time preparing to open. You asked for further information concerning the school, and it is only recently that this has been obtained.\n\nFather Morrisett now states that the school was opened on the 28th of December, and that some twelve Indian children attend regularly. These children live with their parents in the immediate vicinity of Burwash. The people make their living by trapping and hunting. Morrisett states that he is using a log house, 30'x 20' which he built last summer for school purposes. He further states that he is badly in need of school supplies, particularly pencils, readers and arithmetics.\n\nBishop Goderre was in my office yesterday afternoon, and showed me the letter which he had written in this connection. If the Burwash school can show a regular average attendance of twelve or more, it would compare very favourably with the day schools conducted by the Protestant Church in the Territory.\n\nJ. L. Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\nBURWASH LANDING, Y.T.\n3-4-15.\n\nSubject: School of Burwash.\n\nTo Mr. Gibben,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson City, Y.T.\n\nDear Mr. Gibben,\n\nI am surprised to hear that you did not receive the letter I wrote to you in the beginning of February in answer to yours of August the 14th, 1944, concerning the school of Burwash Landing.\n\nI delayed until February to answer your letter in order to give more accurate information after experience. But it seems that you did not receive the said letter. I answer again therefore to the questions you send me.\n\n1/ Yes, the Indians reside at Burwash Landing itself, about 500 yards from the Trading Post.\n\n2/ They are permanently located there and have decent homes, the most decent Indian homes in Yukon, according to some visitors. They spend most of the year at Burwash or near by. Their trap-lines are situated right across the lake (Kluane Lake). In March they go away to the White River (75 miles from Burwash) to hunt musk-rats, and they come back in May.\n\n3/ I am conducting school in a log building. The school-room itself is 30 by 20 ft., and 10 ft. high. Five windows; three big and two medium size, give light to the room. The building belongs to the Mission.\n\n4/ At the present time, eleven children of school age can attend and in fact attend school. Besides these, three over school age children, who never had any schooling before, attend also regularly.\n\n5/ I think I will be able to teach school five days a week and about five months a year: three months in winter and two in summer.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nFr.

T.\n\nWhen at Burwash Landing over the week-end of July 27, 28, and 29, I had an interview with Father Morisset, and inspected the premises which have been constructed for a combination of Church and Day School purposes.\n\nFather Morisset, with some assistance from the Indians and others, has erected quite adequate buildings. The one which is in use as a Day School is well constructed, and can be easily heated. Father Morisset has done a good job with the material at his disposal, and has even gone so far as to make desks for his pupils.\n\nThe Father informs me that he has twelve or thirteen pupils, five of whom are boys, and one of whom is a half-breed, living the life of an Indian. The pupils are of varying ages, one girl being eighteen, and another twenty-two, years of age. None of them have ever had any schooling before.\n\nThe School was opened in January, but was closed during March, April and May, when the pupils were following native pursuits. It has remained open during June and July, but will be closed during August and September, as Father Morisset expects to be in another part of the country.\n\nWhile, in many respects, it may not conform to strict Indian Day School requirements, in my opinion, the project should receive every encouragement. Father Morisset has furnished me with a list of supplies which are needed, and I enclose a requisition for these. I may say that I am also requisitioning for certain medical supplies which are to be dispensed to the children.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 6th September, 1945.\n\nMr. J.E. Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th ultimo with reference to the Burwash Landing Seasonal School.\n\nIt is noted that you found the new building adequate and that reasonable progress is being made in the classroom.\n\nFather Morisset should forward returns for each period during which the school has been open. The first for the period beginning in January, the second for the period June and July and the third at the end of the period when he next teaches. I enclose a supply of forms for this purpose.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, January 15th, 1946.\n\nBURWASH LANDING:\n\nBishop requests payment for months of January, February, March, October, November and December, 1945.\n\nWe have paid Rev.

E. Morisset, O.M.I., for the months of January, February, April, June and July. This request for payment was made by Indian Agent Gibben. Cheque was mailed direct to Father Morisset. In this case you will note that you requested payment for 6 months. We have already paid for 5 months, but we paid for April, June and July, whereas you asked for March, October, November and December. It appears that if we pay for one more month the matter should be balanced, and consequently I am arranging to issue a cheque for the month of December, 1945. This cheque will be drawn in favour of Father Morisset and sent to you.\n\nDEASE LAKE -\n\nBishop Coudert requests payment for January, half of February, half of October, and November, 1945, or a total of three months.\n\nWe have paid Rev. C. Carpentier, O.M.I., for the month of January, 1945. This payment was included in amount covering salary for the period September 1, 1944, to January 31, 1945. Cheque was forwarded to Father Carpentier, in care of R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nIt appears that we owe salary for two additional months, and cheque for this amount will be drawn in favour of Father Carpentier and sent to you.\n\nKLAPPAN -\n\nBishop Coudert requests payment for January, February, March and April, 1945.\n\nRev. J.P. Tanguay, O.M.I., who had to give up duties on account of a serious accident, was paid salary for the period January 25 to March 9, 1945. This cheque was mailed to Father Tanguay's address in Edmonton. In addition we have paid Rev. J. Forget for the period April 1 to May 15, 1945. This cheque was issued in favour of Father Forget but was mailed to Bishop Coudert, Whitehorse, Yukon. It would appear that we do not owe anything further at this school for salary.\n\nLIARD POST (Lower Post)\n\nBishop Coudert requests payment for the months of June, July and August, 1945.\n\nWe have paid Rev. J. Forget for the period June 1 to August 15, 1945. This cheque was drawn in favour of Father Forget and sent to Bishop Coudert. It would\nappear from the above that we owe half a month's salary as we have paid only to August 15 and Bishop Coudert's letter states that the school was open for the full month of August.\n\nTESLIN LAKE -\n\nBishop Coudert requests payment for the months of June, July and August, 1945.\n\nWe have already issued cheque to Rev. A. Dream, O.M.I. for the period June 1 to August 31, 1945. This cheque was mailed to Father Dream, in care of the Catholic Mission, Teslin Lake, Yukon Territory.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, January 16, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nReverend Father Plourde has brought to my attention a letter he recently received from you, with reference to payment of teachers' salaries for seasonal schools.\n\nAs we have not received the usual returns, showing the names of the children, days taught, etc., from the respective teachers, the only information that we have available regarding the periods during which the schools were open is taken from the attached copies of letters which you forwarded to Father Plourde.\n\nThe cheques that we have issued, as shown on the attached statement, were sent direct to the teachers concerned, previous to the time we received your request that all these salary cheques should be forwarded to your office. We will follow the latter procedure in future, as we have done in a few cases in the past.\n\nI wish you would review the attached statement carefully and advise me the exact period during which each of these schools was in operation in the calendar year 1945. As soon as we receive this information, any additional salary will be paid and we will also allow rent for each of the buildings at a rate of $25.00 a month for each month during which the school was in operation. I will arrange to have payments made for the amounts requested for fuel and janitor services, but any balances\n\nRight Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse,\nP.O.
