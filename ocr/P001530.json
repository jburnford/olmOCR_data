S.\n\n(Communicated to the Leader.)\n\nIn the Summer of 1882 His Honour Lieutenant Governor Dewdney fixed on the spot where the railway would intersect Pile of Bones Creek as the site of the capital of the North-West. Many persons had been anxious to find out where the capital would be and a number of enterprising gentlemen, known in history as the Regina Squatters, had pitched their tents here and taken up land. We utterly disapprove of the policy, endorsed by both parties, of a Government trying to make the last penny out of town sites. This is strengthening the head at the expense of the extremities. We think it a pity the Squatters were not allowed to have their land. In the end the Government would have had as much and more, a number of intelligent and enterprising men would have been saved two or three years suspense and Regina would have more substantial citizens than she has.\n\nThe moment the site was fixed on the pioneer trader appeared with tent stores and tent hotels. For some time Regina was the end of a division and there was not less than twenty mile of siding north of the present track. In addition to the trader and the genuine settler there was a large fluent population of a speculative class. In the Autumn of 1882, Mr. W. B. Scarth, and his brother; Sir Roderick Cameron of New York; the Honourable Mr. Vernon (Son of Lord Vernon); Dr. Rae the Arctic explorer; the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, and the present proprietor of the Leader, came up to the North-West in a special car for the purpose in part of holiday, and when they looked out in the morning on Regina they saw a lot of tents, some on what is now known as South Railway Street, others on the present gore. The Criterion which was run by \"Major Granville,\" a scion of the English nobility, was considered the leading hotel and in this tent the visitors had dinner, and invited the principal inhabitants to be present. The nephew of an Earl waited on that occasion and when one of the visitors said:\u2014\"These seem very gentlemanly waiters,\" the reply was, \"I should think they are. Those are the nephews of the Earl of \u2014\u2014\u2014.\" At the dinner it was suggested in fun that Mr. Davin should start a paper here, and the suggestion was thought a good joke. However, he grew fascinated with the country and considered the proposal and the result was that on the 1st of March 1883 the Leader was started, a seven column paper with a circulation to begin with of 7,000. An elaborate plant for job and newspaper work\u2014the finest in the North-West\u2014had been put in and the presses were run by steam. Owing to the removal of the end of the division to Moose Jaw that circulation was not kept up but the paper has at present a larger circulation than all the other papers in the North-West put together. There is no paper in the Dominion of Canada better established or more widely quoted. It is a power. It was owing to its advocacy that the Capital was not moved away from Regina; that the mill Belt was thrown open for settlement; that Southern Manitoba was reopened; that the settlers around Regina and the other town sites along the line were fairly and liberally dealt with; that an appeal was secured from the decisions of ignorant magistrates; that the doubt on the power of municipalities in the North-West to levy and collect taxes was removed. The Leader has led the agitation for representation. Its criticisms on the Mounted Police have greatly tended to bring that body into a state of efficiency; nor is there a wise measure in the interest of the North-West, that it has not advocated. It has been the fearless exponent of settlers rights and every man who has felt aggrieved\nno matter by whom has had its columns open to him, and, if wronged, its advocacy at his command. It was owing to its exertions that the land was obtained from the Government for the Railway north from here to Long Lake, without which the money could not have been had, and therefore to the Leader we are in part indebted for that north-going Railway. Thousands of volumes have been printed and bound by the Leader Company. During the war a special edition was published daily with full telegrams from the seat of war. During the recent trials a full report of them was given daily. A paper with the same recognized influence was never before issued from so young a place as Regina or from any city with ten times its population.\n\nIn those early days the largest tent was that of Mr. J. J. Campbell. Mr. McCormick, who now keeps the Palmer, kept an hotel on South Railway Street; and the hotel now known as the Windsor faced the Station and was known as the Royal.\n\nAmongst the very first merchants were Mowat Bros., the \"Pioneer Store,\" now, one of the most prosperous firms in the city. Smith and Ferguson, whose hardware business has become so extensive as to require several new buildings for the accommodation of their immense stock, are now one of the leading wholesale firms in the North-West. John Dawson's City Drug Store is one of the finest in the Dominion. A visitor shown through the extensive buildings by the gentlemanly manager, Mr. David Bole, is at once impressed with its extent and prosperity. Near it in the same block and in the same line is the handsome store of Mr. Pettingell. Next we have Mr. Samuel Shannon, of the \"Famous Padlock,\" whose excellent workmanship and steady attention to business rank him amongst our leading firms in his line. Mr. J. A. Kerr is one of the first hardware merchants in Regina. Mr. Charles Black has steadily come to the front and is perfectly satisfied as to the future prosperity of Regina\u2014and his business. McCarthy Bros. have been forced to enlarge their boot and shoe manufactory, to meet the demands of our rapidly increasing population. Messrs. Smith and Chutwin, of the Queen City Tailoring House, are kept only too busy. Our old friend the \"Pioneer watchmaker of the North,\" Mr. W. R. Roberts, came, but went again, and his place is well filled by Mr. John Stemshorn. Mr. J. J. W. Smith, in the hardware line, has prospered beyond his most sanguine anticipations. Sprague and Scarlett have found it necessary to enlarge their store, which, taken with the numerous customers seen daily issuing therefrom, is a sure token of prosperity. Mr. James R. Riddal is meeting at every turn with the success his skill as a painter richly deserves. The Colonization Store Co. wears that happy and radiant countenance, which is always expressive of pleasing results. Mr. P. Lamont, finding his former store somewhat small for his rapidly increasing business, removed to more spacious buildings. The new sign which overhangs his door has an air of prosperity in its gentle swinging to and fro, which is corroborated upon entering his exceedingly well furnished store.\n\nWillard Bros., who have kept steadily along the path of fortune, have now the finest harness emporium in the North-West. Sibbald and Lindsay are thorough business men, and upon reviewing their business prosperity, we cannot fail to see their successful enterprise on every hand. Mr. R. B. Ferguson's furniture department is unsurpassed by any west of Winnipeg. McNicol Bros. are our latest acquisition, and from the confident air worn by them it is evident they have no cause to regret opening a business in our midst. Nor must we forget our celestial friends, who on Saturdays may be seen meandering along the streets with a bundle of linen and a smiling countenance, in anticipation of the shekels to come.\n\nRegina has grown beyond anything that\ncould have been anticipated a year ago. Scarth street is well filled up with resident houses and a new post office. On Hamilton street Mr. McCusker's establishment was some time ago the only one. Now Mr. Glass is building and Mr. McKay will be doing so in a few days. Mr. Reid, Mr. Fraser, and Judge Richardson have built handsome houses to the south of Victoria street. A footpath up Hamilton street will soon follow.\n\nRegina is a great legal camp and has already been the scene of a great state trial\u2014that of Riel. It is also the seat of a bishop of the English Church, while the other Christian bodies flourish. A beautiful Church has been erected by the Presbyterians in Scarth street. The jail on the north shore of the Wascana is now practically complete\u2014a fine building.\n\nTHE COUNTY SURROUNDING REGINA.\n\nThe country for forty miles around Regina, is now widely known, to be one of the richest wheat growing countries in the world. The soil which is so admirably adapted to the raising of crops, is from six to fourteen feet in depth, slightly undulating, and of a nature that retains the heat. The water supply is abundant. To the south is the Wascana river, and to the north is the clear and sparkling Boggy Creek which is a stream of pure spring water. Water can also be obtained anywhere on the prairie at a depth of from 24 ft. to 100 ft. Wheat and oats can be sown in some places in the beginning of March, and by the 15th of April seeding is universally completed. The yield of wheat is from thirty to forty-five bushels to the acre on broken and backset land. Oats will yield seventy-five bushels to the acre. The land to the north is well adapted for the raising of all root vegetables. We have frost in September, and farmers who through negligence or otherwise sow their grain late are the only ones who suffer. The nature of the soil is such, that, even if the crop is sown late, it is bound to grow, yet it leaves it too late for ripening, and this is the only chance for grain to get frozen in the field. Now that the Long Lake and Prince Albert branch of railroad is under rapid construction\u2014the starting point being from the Queen City of Regina\u2014we may look forward to a fast development of the great stretch of country to the north. In a very short time we shall see flourishing industries on all sides. Farmers may rest assured of a home market for their produce.\n\nThe troops\u2014which were drawn from every part of the Dominion\u2014have returned to their respective homes, and around the fireside tell strange and wonderful truths of the beauty, fertility prosperity and future greatness, of the vast North-West. We have now a living advertisement throughout the length and breadth of the land. Doubts\u2014if any were entertained\u2014are dispersed, and confidence dwells in the heart of every man as regards the future prosperity of our land.\n\"THE LEADER.\"\n\nA Family Paper,\n\nTHE\n\nFarmer's Friend,\n\nThe Stout Advocate of North-West Interests!\n\nThe Foremost Paper in the TERRITORIES!\n\nOne of the Best Written Papers on the Continent.\n\nThe Leader Office has three Presses constantly at work.
