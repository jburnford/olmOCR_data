(RG 1C, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant #128-1-5 with reference to the proposed workshop and store at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I would ask the Department if they are aware of the fact that part of this building is to be used as a store for the purpose of trading with the Indians, and if the Department have given official consent for such an enterprise. I have never yet heard of the Government putting up buildings to allow private concerns to operate a store, and that is what the Principal of the Mackay Boarding School wishes to do.\n\nIn submitting this plan to me, Mr. Waddy makes the following comment:-\n\n\"The cost will be proportionately less if the workshop alone is built; I recommend that this be allowed. I do not recommend the store part be built by the Department. The Church Authorities will no doubt make a profit if they run a store and can pay the cost of it. However, as the Principal thinks he is within his rights in asking for it I have put it on the plan.\"\n\nMy own opinion is that Mr. Waddy could have told the Principal very emphatically that it was against the law, and even if it were not against the law it would have been wrong to allow him to trade with Indians.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nI bring this matter to your attention because I do not know what took place between the Department and the school authorities before the matter was brought to my attention.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Inspector Christianson and he is of the opinion that a workshop is not very badly needed at that point, and in any case there is sufficient material in an old hospital building quite close to the school to build a workshop if the school authorities wish to use it for that purpose. I will, therefore, not proceed with this until I hear further from you.\n\nThe plan as submitted to you showed clearly the store part mentioned, with counter, private passage, etc., and you have made no comment on this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A of the 13th instant, with reference to the workshop and storeroom at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I note that the storeroom is not for the regular purposes of an Indian residential school and, of course, the Department cannot authorize its erection. Please arrange to build a workshop, however, without delay. Use the materials in the old hospital building as far as possible and incur no unnecessary expense. Arrange for the school management to supply as much labour as possible in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the Principal of the McKay Indian Residential School reports that the storage batteries of the electric light plant of the school are not giving any service; that it is necessary to keep the dynamo running continually. During the summer, 1925, the batteries partly filled up with sediment. The Principal thinks it will be necessary to supply new batteries.\n\nThis plant has at times jumped from positive to the negative without any cause, thus reversing the electric current. When this occurs a few of the wires are changed on the switch board, and the plant runs for a short time, when it will again jump from the positive to the negative.\n\nI beg to recommend that an electrician be supplied for the purpose of thoroughly examining this plant, and if necessary to obtain batteries that instructions be given me where to obtain the same.\n\nThe plant was supplied by the Star Electric Company, Winnipeg.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 13, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the electric lighting plant in the Nishkay Indian Residential School, I beg to say that this plant was installed by the Star Electric Co., of Winnipeg in 1924, and there is no reason why the equipment if properly looked after and operated, should not be in perfect condition. You may make arrangements to have a competent electrician examine the plant, and put same in proper working order. The electrician should submit a report to you stating whether the trouble with the generating outfit was caused by neglect. If the trouble is due to improper operating of the system, the Department will expect the school to pay for the necessary overhauling and repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I think that there is a toilet in the basement we can have put in shape at little expense, I will have the plumber make a report on it when he is at the school. This toilet has never been completed, it would be more sanitary than the outside one used as noted above.\n| Articles | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|----------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n| Hostile Natives | 1 | $140 | $140 |\n\nTotal Value: $1,260\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory for reasons given in Remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDate: [Signature Date]\n\nProvince: [Province]\n**WINNIPEG, Feb. 16-1925**\n\n**TO THE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE COMPANY LTD.**\n\nNO CLAIMS ALLOWED UNLESS MADE WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF GOODS\n\nALL REMITTANCES MUST BE AT PAR WINNIPEG\n\nINTEREST WILL BE CHARGED ON OVERDUE ACCOUNTS AT 10% PER ANNUM\n\nALL GOODS SOLD STRICTLY F.O.B.

Estimated cost f.o.b. The Pas ........................................... $100.00\n2. 5 rolls of paper to be placed between the shiplap and the side.

Freight to the school ......................... 15.00\nTotal for store - $132.00\n5. Lumber for mangers in the stables ........ 50.00\n6.

The above matters have the\napproval of Mr. Indian Agent Waddy and in planning the year's work it would be a great help to the staff if they could have the lumber etc., to complete the store room, the mangers and the implement shed before the rush of garden and farm work comes on them in the spring.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will furnish me with your reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.G.\n\nTBRW/JF.\n| Date       | ARTICLES                                      | Folio | Delta | Credit | Balance |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|---------|\n| Feb. 9     | 49 paper bags and one ball twine.            |       |       |        |         |\n| March 1    | 2 stone jars (5 gal)                         |       |       |        |         |\n|            | 3 60 watt.

Carroll, The Pas Man, for supplies for warehouse, electric lights for agency, and stone jars to use while repairing batteries at McKay Boarding School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Estimates 2.\n\nLetter No. 128/15/1/5 dated Jan. 13/26.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nYesterday acting on your instructions I visited The McKay School, and herewith is submitted my report following my inspection.\n\nThe general health of the pupils is excellent. There has been considerable number of cases of colds and influenza during the past winter season but these have been very efficiently handled by the staff. There are some half dozen pupils with defective vision and I would advise that these be fitted with suitable lenses at the earliest opportunity.\n\nInspected food and clothing of pupils and have no criticism to offer in regard to these.\n\nInspection of building showed that Dormitories, classrooms, playrooms, washrooms etc in the building were clean and in the case of the former, being well ventilated during the time that the children were excluded from them. The staff complain that it is difficult to keep the sleeping quarters well aired at night as the pupils close the windows left open as soon as the members of the staff have retired. In their own homes there is a notorious want of ventilation even the key hole in the doors being plugged. It would seem advisable to devise some system of obtaining fresh air in these rooms by some contrivance which the pupils could not manipulate themselves.\n\nI have previously reported on the outside water closets at this Institution. As seen yesterday at inspection it is impossible to describe the filth of these two out buildings. Even the floors are piled with excreta in the girls' W.C.' and from the looks of the floor in the Boys' it would appear that the floor there had just recently been relieved of a similar load. By his report it is not intended to cast any reflection on the staff for this condition of affairs. The closets in the building off the Dormitories are closed during the day and pupils must use the outside closets. Owing to the nature of the soil it is said to be impossible to dig latrines of sufficient depth. Latrine pails that could be emptied in an incinerator every morning would answer for the summer months but would be impracticable in the cold weather. The only solution I can see is to either build an outhouse that would be connected with the water system of the institution and be heated from it or to fix up W.C.s in the building. I went over the ground with Mr. Hill the plumber and he states that at least three seats could be put in off the boys' play room, together with a urinal. These could be fitted with an automatic flush which would do away with the main objection to the inside W.C. system, viz: that the pupils forget to flush them after using. There are two closets now in the boys' section that only need to be connected...\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. AGENT WADDY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH ON THE MACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 128-1-7.\n\nThe laundry equipment which was supplied to this school was tested out during my visit. It appears to be satisfactory.\n\nThe electric light plant is being overhauled and will be in good shape by the end of the week.\n\nI had the Medical Officer make a report on the outside closets in use at this place. They should be done away with entirely.\n**BURT'S DRUG STORE**\n\n\"The Nyal Quality Store\"\n\nPrescription Druggists\n\nVote 7 Treaty 5.\n\nTHE PAS, MAN., March 10, 1926\n\nSold to Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nThe Pas Agency for John A.

I may say that I wrote to the Chemical Company regarding the price of the acid, which by the way is Chemically Pure, and their explanation is that it had to be brought by Express from Montreal, hence the high price.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory to you, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Immediately after receiving this information I wrote to the Principal, Rev. E.V.Bird, requesting him to furnish me with a full report in this connection and in his report, dated Feb. 2nd, he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"It is very difficult to be able to make any definite statement, the only thing I can suggest, was that the fire started from the stove which heated the building and had to stand between two pens. This space was very narrow, and yet was the only position in which the stove could be placed. The sides of the pen were covered with tin, and I think that possibly there must have been some dust behind the tin. This ignited from the heat of the tin, and probably ran up the post, until it burst out into flame. Of course one can only surmise this. The pipes which I examined after the fire were in good condition, and as for the stove it was impossible for any spark to escape from it.\n\nThe only other way, is that possibly a boy went into the pigpen and put more wood on the fire, and that by some means a spark dropped out and started the fire. However, as the floor was of cement, and always kept free of litter, I do not think the fire started this way.\"\nAs the building was 16 ft. by 24 ft. and stood near to the stock barn, it was with considerable difficulty that the latter building was saved from destruction also. The temperature at the time was 40 degrees below zero, and the Principal and the farm instructor were both frost bitten while working to prevent the fire from reaching the neighboring building. As the sum of $200.00 for the extension of the pigery, was included in the list of requirements forwarded to your Department to be supplied this year, I trust that this sum may be sufficiently augmented to provide this School with a larger and fully modern building to take the place of the one which has been destroyed.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, containing a report from the Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School on the destruction by fire of the pig pen at that school. I am not satisfied that there was no carelessness on the part of the staff. Owing to the position of the stove in the narrow space between the pens, it would appear that there was always danger from fire, and this condition should have been watched more carefully.\n\nThe Department has noted the need of a new building to take the place of the one which was destroyed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. R. R.

Waddy,\nIndian Department,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nAs you are aware the Mackay School is electric lighted and has a vast view from the top of the building looking all over the country adjacent to it. There is considerable travelling done between here and Sturgeon Landing and Cumberland House, and this traffic goes by the Mackay School. It has occurred to me that it would be a very great help to the travelling people especially during snow storms and blizzards and late at night on this road to have a small electric light installed in the tower of the roof of the Mackay School. This light would be seen for quite a long distance around and would aid travelling people who might be caught in a storm at night.\n\nThe Guy Indian School at Sturgeon-Landing have one of these lights installed on the top of their water tower and it can be clearly seen 12 miles across Sturgeon Lake. It has proved to be of great assistance to people crossing the Lake after dark and has enabled them to travel with safety at night.\n\nI hope that you will draw this matter to the attention of the proper authorities and advise me if there is anything that we could do ourselves to help towards having this light placed as asked for.\n\nI am, Yours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager.\nTHE ROSS NAVIGATION CO.

The batteries are not working very satisfactorily at this place.\n\nUnder the circumstances I presume it would be as well to allow this matter to stand over.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJ. W. Waddy Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nThe Pas.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the Pump trouble at The McKay Boarding School at the Big Eddy, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe Pump is in a worn condition, and needs some replacements. As far as I can ascertain it has been doing steady service for 14 years.\n\nThe plunger and foot valves are worn, especially the moving parts and their guides. Also the pump rods, which are of oak are soggy worn thin and peel off.\n\nThese should be renewed at an early date, as they are liable to break at any time, and it is somewhat serious if they break in the well 40 or 50 ft. down, which causes considerable trouble to get them out again, also delay in getting the water service in action again.\n\nThe water pumped is not as much as it was originally for the following reasons:\n1. The worn condition of the valves.\n2. The present pump head is smaller than the original, both in the area of discharge, and the length of stroke.\n\nThe pump is capable of throwing more water than the present Head or Jack can handle.\n\nUntil the valves are renewed it is impossible to tell if the well casing leaks, but by its appearance, this is still in good condition.\n\nThe engine power is adequate.\n\nThere does not appear to be any shortage of water, as the pump plunger is submerged about 15ft.\n\nI trust the above will enable you to form a correct estimate of the present condition of the plant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas. W. Hill\nThe Pas, Man., March 8th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to Vouchers No. 474 and 475, in favor of Charles W. Hill, for repairs at McKay Boarding School, with letter attached.\n\nI beg to state that the pump at the McKay School went out of order on December 31st, and had to be repaired immediately. I could not ask for authority at the time as the work had to be performed before the pipes froze up.\n\nIn reference to the letter from Mr. Hill, I beg to state that it would appear as if all the pump rods, plungers, etc., from the pump head down, should be replaced. He states they are in very bad condition, and it would be much cheaper to put in a new pump right now than to pay more of these repair bills, which are liable to happen at any time. If the Department agrees with this suggestion I will have cost sheets drawn up for the proposed work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 17th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing vouchers in payment for repairs to the pump at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and also enclosing a report from Mr. Chas. W. Hill regarding the condition of this pump and what would be required to place it in a satisfactory condition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that it would be more satisfactory to install a new pump than to have the repairs as enumerated made to the old pump, as there would be no guarantee that it would not be liable to become at more or less frequent intervals in need of further repair. I have, therefore, to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying a new pump of a type that would be satisfactory to meet the purpose for which it is required. The type and make of the pump which you recommend be supplied should also be stated. When we have full information as to the cost involved, consideration will then be given to authorizing the installation of a new pump.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Department Letter No. 5865/I35 dated March 17th, re the pump here,\n\nAfter consultation with Mr. Turner, we cannot make any definite statement as to what would be the best plan to follow.\n\nWhile if new Spool Valves and new Pump Rods were installed, this might be satisfactory, yet we would not like to say that it would, though we have every reason to feel that it may remedy the defect.\n\nAgain it is a question as to whether a new pump fitted inside the casing would be satisfactory, allowing for the thickness for the sockets on the pipe; this would reduce the pipe down to 2 inches, and this probably would be too small a flow of water, and again the rods in such a pump would have to be Steel, and the vibration would shake them, as also the pump pipes, as they could only be slipped inside the casing and hang from the top.\n\nSomehow I feel that it would be worth while to have new rods and new Spool Valves installed, for if they prove to be the remedy, then the pump would give more satisfaction than a new pump installed inside the casing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E. V. Bird,\nPrincipal.\nThe Pas, Man.\nApril 11th 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to letter #128-1-5 of the 17th ultimo regarding pump for the Mackay School, I beg to say that I have delayed answering this letter until I investigated the matter fully.\n\nI went to the school and tried to find out why the pump could not be pulled up as is usual when repairs are being made. I asked all sorts of questions and at last found that the trouble there is that the lining for the well was only put down one length from the top, then the pump was installed in the well. In the years which have passed since then dirt and rocks have fallen in and jammed the pipe of the pump so it cannot be withdrawn. In other words if they cannot fix the pump they will need a new well. Mr. Turner who was Inspector of Construction at time the school was erected told me the truth when I asked him, after I found out that the casing was not put into the well. He said that when the well was dug they did not put in casing after the rock formation was reached. I then tried to get them to consent to using the old well pipe as a casing and insert a smaller pump, but they state this would not be satisfactory. All we can do now is fix the pump the best way we can and when it plays out dig a new well and go to all the expense of a new pump.\n\nA letter from the Principal is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 20th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the pump at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and enclosing a communication from the Principal regarding the matter. It is hoped that arrangements can be carried out to utilize the present well. You should endeavour, with the assistance of the school authorities, to have it fixed up the best way possible. We are not prepared to authorize the expense involved in the digging of a new well and the supplying of a pump.\n\nI have also your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the providing of a grant to have the dormitories and schoolrooms painted. In this connection I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $200 in the purchase of the materials required for the purpose. The cost of the labour, however, will have to be provided by the school authorities from their per capita grant or other receipts. You may arrange for the purchase of the paint, etc., required, obtaining competitive prices, if possible, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. After the purchase has been made, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nRelative to the supplying of a belt for the laundry machine, I have to say that the expenditure for this purpose will have to be provided by the school authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have the honor to advise the Department that the Principal of the Mackay Boarding School has asked me to apply to the Department for a pig pen for the school.\n\nHe has supplied me with a plan of what he requires, the place is to be 17'2\" X 40', with interior fittings as supplied by the B.T.Co.\n\nThe cost of this place is about as follows:\n\n- Lumber and cement $400.00 & brick\n- Fittings 500.00\n- Labor 200.00\n- Fencing 150.00\n- Hardware and paper and stove 75.00\n- Freight and extras 75.00\n\nTotal 1400.00\n\nIf it is decided to build a pig pen at this place the plan outlined by Mr. Bird is quite suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the building of a pig pen at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and giving an estimate of the cost of the materials and labour required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that the dimensions of the building are too large and that the cost of erecting same would be too high. Some funds are provided for the erection of a pig pen at this school and instructions will be issued later regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

He further states that as the season is so late this year the painting will have to wait until winter before the school management can undertake it, as they will have more other work than they can handle during the short summer. As our Commission do not consider it would be wise to have the painting undertaken during the winter months when all the staff and pupils are in residence, they requested the Principal to furnish them with an estimate of the cost of outside help required for this work, and I enclose herewith a tender submitted by one Sam Lovell. You will observe that the amount he asks is $150, and I shall be obliged, if under the circumstances set forth above your Department will authorize this expenditure, or instruct Mr. Indian Agent Waddy to call for tenders and have the work done.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nDICATED BUT NOT PERSONALLY SIGNED BECAUSE OF ABSENCE FROM THE OFFICE\nOttawa, June 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to Rev.

I wish to point out that it is the general practice of the Department to expect such activity from the members of the staff and the older boys. It is not only a good training, but it releases the parliamentary appropriation for Indian education for improvements that cannot be effected by them.\n\nI may say that there is a total of $1600 available for improvements at the MacKay Institution this year. The items were as follows:\n\n- Telephone line - $600.\n- Hen house - $400.\n- Hog pen - $600.\n\nOne of these improvements will have to stand until next year. Please let me know which one is the least important. You may inform the Principal that the Department will make an exception this year and allow $150 for the labour in connection with the painting. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy is being informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

I directed his attention to the urgent need of an engine for the freight canoe at the MacKay School The Pas., Man., and was advised to address a written communication to you in this connexion.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, this School is located about seven miles from the town of The Pas. and during the summer months all transportation is by means of canoe. As there is no telephone communication between the school and the town frequent journeys have to be made for mail as well as for supplies and other purposes and consequently a motor-driven canoe is an indispensable necessity. Our Society can secure a Johnson Light Twin Outboard Motor which is guaranteed to drive an 18 ft. freight canoe against a 4 mile an hour current, and even with another canoe at the same time, for $175 and it will be a great help to our Society if your Department will authorize this expenditure. During my interview with the Superintendent of Indian Education I agreed that the building of the pigery might be postponed this year, if your Department would undertake to purchase the engine required, in addition to the painting of the interior of the main school building, and I trust that this agreement may be approved and the purchase of the engine sanctioned.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will find a reference to this agreement in a letter which was addressed to you today in connexion with our request for an engine for the freight canoe at this school.

You will note that the total amount sanctioned by the Indian Commissioner for this purpose is $1,000, only and that the estimated cost according to Mr. Waddy's figures is not less than $1,641. As the School stands very much in need of this means of communication with the town of The Pas, and the Acting Principal is anxious to do all he can to have it installed, he has written to me for advice and instruction in the matter. He is strongly of the opinion that better results could be obtained if the work were let by contract than if undertaken by the School management. In the contract the wish of the Indian Commissioner that Indian labour be employed, could be stipulated. As the chief difficulty, according to Mr. Waddy's letter, appears to be one of cost, I shall be glad if you will give this matter further consideration and take whatever steps may be in your power to provide the additional amount required over and above the amount which the Indian Commissioner has already sanctioned.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 28, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the installation of a telephone at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I note that the estimate is over $1600.

(RC 10, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose report of my visit to the MacKay Indian Residential School during the month of November, 1927. In addition to the enclosed report I wish to state that the radiators in this school are in bad shape. Sixteen were leaking at the time of my visit to the school, as the weather was excessively cold and a large head of steam was being carried. Sixteen air valves are required immediately to repair these radiators. They also should have one week of a plumber's time in the spring when steam is cut off to have the large radiator valves fixed and repacked, etc.\n\nSince visiting the school the last time the pump has been fixed by the local plumber, but he tells me it will not stand up very long in his opinion. He also says that the lining of the well is in very bad shape, and he does not think it will last much more than a year, if it lasts that long.\n\nThe compression tank in the water distributing system has rusted from the inside and is leaking. It is hard to tell how long it will be till large leaks develop. We have the small ones plugged up at the present. It would appear as if this compression tank will have to be renewed shortly, and if so I think it would be well to put in two smaller tanks instead of the one large one, and we could shut off one tank occasionally and paint the inside to keep it from rusting. It is not possible to do anything to this present tank as it is continually in use.\n\nThe engine used in the lighting plant is about used up. The Principal states we require a twelve horse power engine for a place of this size, with a generator and batteries large enough to suit. All the present electric light system appears to be too small and light for the job, and they have been continually overloaded since they were installed. The batteries are now entirely out of commission and no storage of electric light is possible.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nTHE PAS, 2nd December 1927\n\nJ.W. Waddy Esq,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nThe Pas.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to make the following report on the condition of the Electric Lighting Plant at The McKay Boarding School.\n\nEngine 6, M.P. Fairbanks.\nEngine labors hard on full load, indicating insufficiently powered. Cylinder head heats up too much, and the Exhaust Valve guide hole is badly worn. This has already caused replacement of 2 valves. To remedy this a new head is required immediately, as engine continually loses compression.\n\nStorage Battery.\nThis battery has lost its capacity, all the active material and plate filling is destroyed. Would suggest it be exchanged for a new one.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waddy Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nThe Pas.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReport on Deep Well Pump.\n\nI have to report that the well casing is either broken at a joint, or corroded at several small places. As long as the pump is working the casing remains full, and pumps water to the storage tank, but immediately the pump stops, the water disappears. I had a difficulty in getting the plunger past a point 35 feet from the surface, the obstruction seems to be a broken joint in the pipe. The water would get away there, and at places where corrosive action has eaten through the casing. I am inclined to think that there is considerable corrosion, as the pipes have been in for about 14 years, and I have had to replace in this district, water pipes that have only done 10 years service. Casing is of wrought Iron pipe.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Hill, The Pas, Manitoba, for repairs to the pump and the electric lighting plant at the MacKay Indian Residential School. The authority for the pump is letter 128-1-5 of April 20th, 1927; the other repairs were all urgent. The Department advised me that the belt item of $18.00 on October 27th, should be paid by the School authorities, and I have told the plumber that this will probably be disallowed by the Department.\n\nI enclose with the vouchers a report on the pump and well. It can be seen from this report that the well is in bad shape, and it is liable to go out of commission at any time. It would appear from all I can make out that a new well will have to be dug at this institution in the very near future, as it is impossible to pull the pipes out of the old well and when they fall in, as they soon will, the well will be out of commission entirely.\n\nI reported after my last visit to the school that the engine and electric lighting plant was in bad shape, and last week when I was away from town part of it went entirely out of commission, and the plumber had to do some more work on it. I enclose a report regarding this system also, and if a new plant is not put in the repairs asked for should be allowed.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRe your file 126-1-15.\n\nWe thank you for your inquiry of January 13th and attach hereto quotation on 10 H.P. kerosene and 10 H.P. fuel oil engines, for special electric service, also quotation on 56 cell storage battery mentioned in your letter.\n\nIn connection with quotation on the type \"M\" fuel oil engine, we are enclosing our bulletin 1000A, which illustrates and describes this type of engine, which is known as a modified Diesel, and might point out that while the first cost of this engine is higher than the kerosene engine, the saving in the cost of fuel, and maintenance, very soon makes up for the additional first cost, and continues to pay you dividends as long as the engine is operated. At the present time we are informed that fuel oil can be purchased at The Pas in drums, at a price of 22.6\u00a2 per Imperial gallon f.o.b. The Pas.\n\nOur 10 H.P. fuel oil engine is guaranteed to operate at full load, on a fuel consumption of 1/12 of an Imperial gallon of approved fuel oil per horse power per hour, or a total of 5/6 of a gallon, which at a price of 22.6\u00a2 means that your fuel cost would be 18.4\u00a2 per hour of operation at full load. As one of these 10 H.P. engines will carry a load of 6 K.W., this means that your fuel cost for producing current is a fraction over 3\u00a2 per kilowatt, which you will agree represents a considerable saving over the use of even the most economical kerosene engine. Then again our type \"M\" engine is so simple, with so few working parts, that the cost is maintenance is kept at a minimum.\nWe have a great number of successful installations in Western Canada, and if you are interested will be very pleased to furnish references.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE COMPANY\n\nper.\n\nJ.M. Walton,\nEngine Department.\n\nP.S. In connection with this quotation, if it is possible for your office to place this business with us in Winnipeg, we would appreciate it if you would arrange to do so, so that we may have a record of the sale and be in a position to render you service in the event that it should be needed at any time.\nJune 27, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 19th instant, I would ask you to kindly ship addressed to J. W. Waddy, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man., 1 - 10 H. P. Fairbanks Morse type \"F\" horizontal modified Diesel fuel oil engine, as described in your quotation, at the price quoted. Also 1 - 150 ampere hour, 56 cell, Exide storage battery, at the price quoted.\n\nThe accounts in duplicate should be forwarded to Indian Agent Waddy, and I would ask you to kindly send full instructions for the operation and installation of the gas engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Fairbanks Morse type \"F\" horizontal modified Diesel fuel oil engine, at the price quoted of $1,187.00 f.o.b. The Pas., Man. Also 1 - 160 ampere hour, 56 cell, Exide storage battery at their price of $636.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg. When this equipment arrives kindly arrange to have same installed at the McKay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Fairbanks Morse Co. have been asked to forward the accounts to you in duplicate which I would ask you to please certify to, and they have been also requested to furnish full instructions for the operating and installing of the gas engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas., Man.\nFebruary 1, 1928.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAttention Mr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nWe wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 27th, and in accordance with your instructions we have entered your order for one 10 HP Fairbanks-Morse type \"T\" horizontal modified diesel fuel oil engine, price f.o.b. the Pas $1675.00 and one 160 ampere hour, 56 cell, oxide storage battery f.o.b. the Pas $335.00, and wish to thank you for this order.\n\nFollowing your instructions this shipment will go forward to J. W. Waddy, Indian agent, the Pas, Manitoba, freight and carriage charges prepaid. An instruction book will be included with the shipment, and in the course of the next few days we will mail to Mr. Waddy a blueprint showing the foundation for the engine.

INDIAN AGENT WADDY,\nfor the Month of February, 1928, on the\nMacKay Indian Residential School. Report\ndated Feb. 22nd, 1928.\n\nOriginal on File 128-1-7.\n\nThe bake oven is all worn out. It is\nan Economy oven made by Daoust holding about 60\nloaves. This school requires a larger oven. The\nbaker does not like this make of oven and, if the\nDepartment will supply another oven, I beg to\nrecommend that some other make be supplied.\n\nThe barn floor is worn out and requires\n32 planks, 1 foot by 10 feet, to fix it up.\nOttawa, March 2nd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your report for the month of February, last, on the MacKay Indian Residential School in which you state that the bake oven at present in use is worn out and that a new oven is required, I have to request that you will state definitely the make of oven required, giving full particulars as to the capacity, dimensions, etc., as well as the name of the manufacturer, as it is noted that the baker at the school does not like an oven of the Economy type, which is at present in use. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to authorizing the purchase of the new oven.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 32 planks, each 10' in length and 1' in width, for the repairs required to the barn floor. You should endeavour to obtain these planks at the lowest possible cost, and forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. It is understood that the school authorities will provide any labour required in putting in the planks without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Waddy, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man., to supply a bake oven for the use of the MacKay Indian Residential School at that point. I may say that the oven at present in use was supplied by your firm a number of years ago. It is an Economy oven of about 60 loaves' capacity and is at present worn out. The school authorities have not been entirely satisfied with this oven. They now request that a larger one, having a capacity of 100 to 125 loaves, be supplied.\n\nI would request that you take this matter up with Mr. J. W. Waddy, Indian Agent, The Pas, giving him full particulars as to the various types of oven manufactured by your firm, and ascertain from him definitely the type that would be suitable for the use of the above named school. We are informing Mr. Waddy that you have been requested to communicate direct with him concerning this matter. When we have full particulars regarding the type of oven, the cost, etc., consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJean J.

I beg to say that it is considered this is a more expensive type of oven than the Department supplies to residential schools. The oven manufactured by J. J. D'Aoust, Limited, St. Boniface, has been supplied to a large number of our Indian residential schools and in each case has given entire satisfaction. The only complaint we have received regarding this oven is from the staff of the Mackay School.\n\nWe are requesting the Jean J. D'Aoust, Company to correspond with you direct, giving full information as to the various types of ovens they manufacture. There is no doubt that they can supply the school with an oven that would be entirely satisfactory and at a much lower cost than the price now submitted for a Roberts oven. After you have heard from this firm, you should take the matter up with the Principal and furnish the Department with further particulars as to the size and type of D'Aoust oven that would be satisfactory and the cost of supplying same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dr. Westgate and he asks if the Department would supply a small boat for the use of the Mackay Indian Residential School to use in hauling freight etc to the school.\n\nUp to the present they have been using motor boats and motor canoes but these are all getting old and out of shape.\n\nThe cost of a boat such as he wants would be about $550.00 f.o.b. The Pas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Mackay School (May 5 & 6) my attention was directed to the urgent need of a new and larger boat for this institution, and I am writing for the express purpose of soliciting the assistance of your Department in meeting this need.\n\nThe School, as you are aware, is situated approximately 7 miles from The Pas on what is known as Fischer Island. As communication between the School and the town is maintained during the summer months along the Saskatchewan River, it is necessary that a serviceable boat to meet the different kinds of weather should be available for the School management. The canoe which is in use at present and which has been fitted with an outboard engine is an 18 foot freighter and is too small to negotiate the currents at the Big Eddy, or to ride the waves on so wide a river when proceeding against the strong wind. I know very well myself from actual experience the dangers to which the School management are exposed when travelling in the discharge of their duties on so small a craft, and I do not think that they should be exposed to this danger any longer than can possibly be helped. At the time of my visit practically the whole countryside was flooded and the channel between the highland of the Reserve and the Island, and in which I had never seen water on any of my former visits, was now filled to a depth of 5 feet or more, and running with a strong current. The need of a bigger and stronger boat fitted with a good engine was so obvious to me that I talked the matter over with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy who stated that he felt it was essential for this School to be provided with a larger and stronger boat such as I had suggested. He informed me that The Pas Canoe Company built\nstandard boat which cost approximately $500.00, and I am of the opinion that a boat of this type would meet the immediate needs of this institution. As the canoe at present in use can no longer be considered seaworthy, and will soon have to be scrapped, I beg to recommend that your Department authorize the purchase of one of the standard boats as built by The Pas Canoe Company for the use of the Mackay School, or that you make the purchase direct through your Indian Agent.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\n$600.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, requesting that a new boat be supplied for the use of the MacKay Indian Residential School to replace the present canoe, fitted with an outboard engine, which has been in service for a number of years and is unsafe for further use.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the sum of $1500 was provided in the Estimates for the current fiscal year for repairs and replacements at this school, also the sum of $600 to erect a hog pen. We have already authorized the purchase of a bake oven, at a cost of $400, and if you consider that the supplying of the boat is more urgent than any of the requests enumerated in the list of requirements submitted by your Society for inclusion in our Estimates for the fiscal year, the Department will approve of providing the funds necessary to purchase the new boat. I shall be pleased to be informed by you as to whether you would recommend that the new boat be supplied from the amount available for replacements rather than in carrying out the other requirements referred to above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The present machinery room is too small to contain it. The Principal says it would be too costly to enlarge this room in the main building and he suggests erecting an addition to the pump house for the whole electric light plant. This place would be 16 X 30. I am leaving here for Treaty 10 and cannot look after any construction, so I told the Principal to get an estimate of the cost of the place he has in mind and take it up with the Department direct. He thinks it will be necessary to put in larger generator; his present one is 110 and he thinks a 220 one should be supplied.\n\nSome of the plaster on the stairways is cracked and has chipped off, he asks for an appropriation of about $40.00 to repair it.\n\nThe flashing around the cupola of the main building should be repaired, it leaks and will in a short time let in too much rain and bring down the plaster on the ceilings. It will take about $150.00 to tear out the old material and make proper repairs.\n\nThe well is still operating but may be out of order this summer; it will be necessary to dig a new well some time soon as the old one will be hard to fix when the casing rusts away a little more. It may be that the Department has some expert who could look it over and figure out some way of using the present well again. One or us here can see how it can be done.\n\nAuthority was given to get the compression tanks fixed or replaced when necessary. I think it should be done this summer; the old one is gradually going out of order and rusting away.\n\nThe average attendance is 81 this quarter up to time of my visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 16, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, furnishing a report as to the repairs, etc., required at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $40 in having the plaster on the stairways repaired. The sum of $150 is also approved in having the flashing around the cupola of the main building repaired in order to prevent leakage. You should arrange for the purchase of any materials required in carrying out the above repairs. The school authorities should arrange for as much of the labour as possible.\n\nRegarding the compression tank in the water distributing system, I have to request that you will state the cost of putting in a new tank or the installing of two smaller ones instead of the one large tank, as mentioned in your letter of December 5th, last.\n\nFull information should also be given as to the cost of drilling a new well, as it is noted that the school authorities and yourself have been unable to make the necessary repairs to place the present well in a satisfactory condition.\n\nIt is noted that the electric light machinery which was supplied has not yet been put in condition and that the Principal suggests the erection of an addition to the pump house to contain the electric light plant. When we have an estimate of the cost of building this addition, the digging of a new well and the installing of a new compression tank, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Re the repairs that are urgently needed at the school, and which should be attended to this summer; and the eliminating of others so that a boat could be procured.\n\nIt is very essential that we have a boat, for two reasons the present canoe, is getting shaky, and would have to soon be scrapped and we are unable to put on anything of a load for this reason, consequently we have to make more trips to Town; this means a great loss, in time, and Gasoline.\n\nI would strongly recommend that some of the items stand over, until next year, so that the boat could be procured, the type of boat in question does not draw much more water than a canoe.\n\nBelow I append a list of the repairs required to be done, as numbered in copy sent.\n\n(a) Repairs to wall of Furnace boiler $300.\n(b) do do Radiator Valves, etc. 85\n(c) do do Flushing Cisterns, etc. 60\n(d) do do Ceilings in corridor, etc. 75\n(e) do do Cupola etc. 150\n(f) do do to Guttering, etc. 35\n(g) Girls Play Ground Fence 101.50\n(h) Siding to Store House, etc. 142. 948.50\n\nNew Boat 500.00\n\nThis would leave $252.00 unexpended.\n\nIn addition to the above, a building has to be erected to house the new Electric Engine and Generator, I proposed to Mr. Waddy that a building be put on the foundation of the store that was burnt, what he has done in the matter I cannot say, at the present he is away on a treaty trip, that will last three months, I believe the Department are sending Mr. Bunn to look after his work while he is away.\n\nSo soon as I can see Mr. Bunn, I will make enquiries regarding this.\n\nI hope I have made myself explicit.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n(Signed) F. Turner Acting Principal\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of May 10th and your reply on May 19th (128-1-5) relative to the need of a new boat for the Mackay School, I beg to state that upon receipt of your letter I referred the matter to Mr. Turner, the Acting Principal of this institution for a specific recommendation as to whether the boat was of greater urgency than some of the other improvements which we had requested your Department to furnish this year. I have just received Mr. Turner's reply and enclose herewith a copy of the same for your information. I also beg to recommend that authority be given to Mr. Indian Agency Waddy to purchase the boat immediately, and to undertake the other improvements, including the engine house set forth in the enclosed letter.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Westgate and Mr. Indian Agent Waddy regarding replacements and repairs that are urgently needed at the Mackin Indian Residential School, also for a new boat for freighting purposes between The Pas and the school. I have today received a letter from Mr. Ferrier, who has just visited the school, in which he strongly urges that the repairs and replacements, as enumerated in the letter from the Principal and forwarded by Rev. Dr. Westgate, to the amount of approximately $900, be allowed. Mr. Ferrier requests that either the Principal or Dr. Westgate be authorized to have these repairs carried out and that the amount mentioned be granted for the purpose.\n\nLast year, we provided electric light equipment, but this has not been put in use, as the electric engine and generator were too large to go in the present basement, where the old plant is installed. It is requested that a building for the purpose be erected, approximately 16 x 30 ft. This building will be attached to the pumping house and can be heated along with it. Including a cement base for the new engine, the cost will be approximately $800. Mr. Ferrier states that this work is urgent.\n\nThe school also requires a new boat. The old one is a worn out freight canoe with outboard motor. The journey from The Pas to the school at this season of the year is 10\u00bd miles of water against a current. Mr. Ferrier states that a good strong boat, 24 ft. long, should be supplied. Both Dr. Westgate and the Principal have also urged the supplying of this boat. The boat could be built at The Pas for approximately $400 and the engine for same would cost about $410 - or a total cost of approximately $800.\n\nI may add that our Estimates provide the sum of $2100 for repairs and replacements at this school. If the above mentioned items are authorized, it would require an expenditure of approximately $2500. I beg to recommend that Rev. Dr. Westgate be given the necessary authority.\nOttawa, June 30, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Acting Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School, relative to the repairs that are urgently required and the supplying of a boat. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, who recently visited this school, has recommended that certain replacements and repairs be authorized. An amount not exceeding the sum of $900 may be utilized in carrying out the repairs required, as mentioned in the Acting Principal's letter, viz.:\n\nRepairs to wall of furnace boiler,\n\" radiator valves, etc.,\n\" flushing cisterns, etc.,\n\" ceilings in corridor, etc.,\n\" cupola, etc.,\n\" guttering, etc.,\nGirls' playground fence,\nSiding to store house, etc.\n\nI may add, for your information, that Mr. Agent Waddy was authorized to have the repairs to the ceilings and corridor and to the cupola carried out; but, as he is at present absent on treaty payments, it is thought that he would not have arranged to have this work done.\n\nIt is urgent that a building be provided in which to install the new electric engine and generator for the lighting equipment which was supplied last year. It is suggested that this be erected as an addition to the pump house and heated along with it. Mr. Agent Waddy stated that it should be approximately 16 x 30 ft. Including a cement\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reference to the pressure tanks required for the water system at the Mackay Indian Residential School I beg to say that some time ago the Department told me to draw to their attention the above matter when it was thought necessary.\n\nWhen I was at the school lately I examined the large pressure tank and it is leaking very badly. The plumber was inside the tank and reported it pitted very badly up to the level of the water and that the whole tank is liable to go out of business at any time. The old tank is 1500 gal capacity.\n\nWhat is required is two tanks of about 600 gal capacity each. One tank could be drained and painted as required without putting the whole system off of use, and in this manner would always be in good condition. The small tanks should be shipped as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

The school at present is in fair state, it got badly run down last summer and looked as if a hail storm had cleaned out most of the windows when Mr. Hamilton was there, the youngsters had broken so much glass. The storm windows had not been removed during the summer and in fact it looked like a deserted old shack. I got after the new principal as soon as he arrived and he has had the place cleaned up and at time of my visit most of the glass had been replaced. The inside of the school has received attention and in a short time matters will be back to normal.\n\nThe engine house has been built and the engine installed, the lighting plant seemed to be giving satisfaction as it had just been completed. Everything is not just as it should be yet, but Mr. Conlin seems to be a capable man and he is getting things in hand quietly. There were so many matters to talk over and check up at time of my visit that I had no time to check up the class rooms, I will make another visit shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In the interval which has elapsed between the account being rendered to Turner, and the present date, our copy of the account has been lost. We cannot render an account, detailed, which would correspond with the previous one, so we are doing the next best thing and wording the account to show the job as a contract, which it actually was. I suppose Turner has already turned the previous account in to the Department at Ottawa, so they will have the details in any case.\n\nYours very truly\n\nTHE PAS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nPER.\nOffice of the The Pas Indian Agency,\n\nThe Pas, Man., October 29th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 226 and 227.,\n\namounting to $1726.20 in favour\n\nof The Pas Construction Co.

This, of course, is no surprise to me, as we have never had proper management here. Inspector Christianson tells me that at the time he visited this school, two years ago, Mr. F. Turner was acting as a general man and labourer around the school, and he was not a fit person in any way to place in charge of the institution. It seems to me that the whole management here is bad, and with so many children in attendance at this school I think we should insist on its being straightened up and put in proper shape, as it is certainly no credit to the Department under the present conditions. It is hard to know just where to begin. From what I can gather from both Inspectors, the staff is not at all what it should be. You will also note that the building presented a neglected appearance, due to nothing more or less than mismanagement on the part of those in charge. To have the screens torn off some of the windows and destroyed, while on other windows the storm sash were left on all summer is disgraceful, to say the least. I would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the condition of some of the beds in the girls' dormitory which he states are not fit to sleep on. There is no excuse for this. As regards the fire hose, I think another fifty feet of hose should be placed there, and instructions given regarding the care and use of same. The Inspector reports the pressure tank as being in poor condition, and states also that they have difficulty in getting water. This latter item, however, might be a minor difficulty if it were in the hands of a practical man. We are called upon to look after things at long range, and it is almost impossible to get accurate information. On several occasions we have sent men out from here to these points, when according to the reports it appeared to be work requiring the services of an expert and when they have gone out they have discovered very little wrong. You will note that the barn and chicken house were dirty, and the windows in the chicken house and workshop broken. In fact, the Inspector reports that at every turn he could see evidences of a lack of supervision.\nThey have an insufficient quantity of feed put up for the stock, notwithstanding the fact that the Department a couple of years ago took steps to provide them with new hay lands. You will notice the Inspector says he visited the hay lands for his own satisfaction and found an abundance of hay, so that this shortage should not exist. The report on the whole shows a very unsatisfactory state of affairs at the McKay School, and it is to be hoped that the new Principal is a highly qualified man who will reorganize the whole staff. The Department should insist on this.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is situated about ten miles up the Saskatchewan River on land that is an island except when the river is very low. The island is practically covered with bush and rock, so that it is impossible to do any farming.\n\nThe school is managed by the Church of England and Mr. F. Turner has been in charge during the past year. He was absent when I visited the school and Rev. A. Fraser was acting. I understood that a new principal was to arrive October 1st.\n\nI regret to report that I was not favourably impressed with the general management of the school. The children appeared to have little supervision. I found boys and girls in the kitchen and in the basement with no member of the staff around. In fact, I went from the basement through the kitchen, dining room and front hall, and upstairs before I found any member of the staff. The matron was upstairs and\n\nI learned\nI learned later that the kitchen matron was busy doing extra work, due to a shortage of members on the staff. Two members are needed, a girls' supervisor and a laundry matron, and I understand Miss Fraser, the sewing teacher, is only temporary. I might also add that the entire staff was new to the work except Miss Warener, the matron, whom I believe has had too heavy a task and, in fact, appeared very much in need of a rest. I emphasised to Mr. Fraser, the Acting Principal, the grave responsibility resting upon each member in charge of the children and pointed out that boys must not be allowed to roam about the building unless proper supervision be given. He agreed and assured me that he would take the matter up and during the few remaining days while he was in charge a closer watch would be exercised.\n\nI must say the building presented a very neglected appearance. On many windows the screens were torn and destroyed, while on others the storm sash had never been removed. Many of these sash have no sliding glass by which fresh air can be admitted. There was scarcely a window without some broken glass and at least fifty or sixty new panes were needed.\n\nThe senior classroom is in charge of Miss Farrow and has an enrolment of 44, 24 boys and 20 girls. Miss Farrow is a qualified teacher and should do well. I found the pupils fair in some subjects, but in reading, they appeared hopeless. They would scarcely speak above a whisper and Miss Farrow was of the opinion that it would be impossible to improve this. I, however, took each member of the class and had them read one line.\none line, after which I moved further away and had it re-read, and after several such tries the voice greatly improved and I think Miss Farrow realized that by perseverance these children can be made to speak so that their voice will carry across the classroom.\n\nMiss Vincent is in charge of the junior room, with an enrolment of 24. The boys numbered 20 and the girls 4. The work appeared very good, although here, again, the children would scarcely speak above a whisper. However, Miss Vincent is determined to improve this and I would expect a decided change after she has been in charge a few months. Miss Vincent holds her Second Class Certificate and promises well as a teacher. The teacher's desk is a homemade affair and is a disgrace.\n\nThe junior room was without any screens and the outside windows were still on. I was informed that the classroom was also used as a playroom and it was impossible to keep the children from destroying the screens. I instructed the Principal, and also the teacher, to have two of the outside windows removed at once and to keep the windows open so that fresh air may be obtained. Apparently the children do as they please, regardless of what damage is done to the school property. I can see no reason why these window screens should be destroyed if the children are properly trained and supervised.\n\nThe girls' dormitory was clean. Some of the outside windows were still on and many of the screens were destroyed. The bed springs were in bad condition and many...\nand many were scarcely fit to sleep on.\n\nThe boys' dormitory was in much the same condition as the girls', except that the bed springs were good. I understand these were replaced recently.\n\nThe waiting room used for Indian parents appeared more as a store room. It was untidy and certainly not a good example for the Indians.\n\nI tried out the fire hose and found one that was absolutely worthless. The hose on the top floor appeared to have been thrown at the holder and was without a nozzle. A new 50 ft. hose and nozzle should be supplied. The 5 gal. fire extinguishers were all standing in the waiting room. I arranged with the Principal to have these placed in prominent places on each floor so that they may easily be reached in case of fire. Some small Pyrene extinguishers were hanging in various places throughout the building.\n\nThe pressure tank in the basement is badly rusted all along the bottom and already has sprung small leaks. The plumber who cleaned this tank out the day previous to my visit claimed the tank would stand no pressure and should be replaced at once. He recommended two tanks so that when one is being cleaned or repaired, the other would supply the building with water. Should this tank give way at any time, the school would be without water. The water for the school is supplied from a drilled well, which is giving considerable trouble. The steel casing goes down only 20 ft. and apparently the rock below this has fallen in and settled around the pump so that now it is impossible to remove the pump. If, at any time, the pump gives out and the repair cannot be carried out...\nout, the school will be without water. This well, I understand, is 80 ft. deep.\n\nThe barn was in fair repair, but was not clean. The chicken house was very dirty and practically all the window lights were broken. The workshop had the lights out and also some of the window sash were broken. These buildings presented a disgraceful appearance.\n\nThe yards about the barn and school are stony. In addition to these stones, they were littered with pieces of wood and rubbish so that the whole place presented a neglected appearance. Mr. Turner, who was Principal during the past year, was an old man and apparently he had far too much work to do. Mr. Fraser, who is now supplying, had only been there a couple of weeks and expected to be relieved on October 1st. I found Mr. Fraser willing to carry out any suggestions and I have no doubt he would do his best during the remainder of his time in charge. On every turn one could see the lack of supervision and general management and undoubtedly a big task awaits the new Principal.\n\nIn closing, I should mention that Mr. Fraser was finding it difficult to get sufficient hay up for winter. Probably 30 loads were in stack, but a great deal more will be needed. I visited the hay flats and found an abundance of hay, so that, should a shortage occur, it will be due to a lack of effort on the part of those in charge and certainly not because the hay is scarce.\n\nI did not see the cattle, but I understand about 12 head are kept and also a number of horses.\nMACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe children were well clothed and I believe receive sufficient food. I was present at the noon day meal, which consisted of abundance of fish, potatoes and bread, along with another vegetable and tea.\n\nThe garden was very fine and showed that great care had been given it. The vegetables were excellent and there appeared sufficient to supply the school during the winter months.\nOttawa, November 14, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your No. 205-11 of the 7th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his visit to the MacKay Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Department has noted the conditions found by the Inspector under the management of the late acting principal. A new principal, Rev. T. D. Conlin, has been appointed, and, we understand, assumed duties on the 1st of October, last. He was well recommended, and it is hoped that the conditions mentioned by the Inspector will be remedied under his management.\n\nRegarding the pressure tank, I have to inform you that Mr. Agent Waddy was instructed to purchase 2 - 1500 gallon tanks and have them installed.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to purchase and forward a teacher's desk. It should be similar in type to that described in the catalogue of the Western School Supply Limited, Regina, as their No. 11 teacher's sanitary desk.\n\nPlease also arrange for the purchase and delivery of 50' of fire hose, with nozzle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Secy-Treas.\nIndian Residential School Commission\nM.S.C.C.\n\nEnclos.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Mackay School (Feb. 22 - Feb. 25) I made careful note of some of the repairs which are urgently required in connection particularly with the main school building, and subsequently discussed the same with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, who concurred in my opinion that these repairs and improvements should be undertaken with the least possible delay. They are as follows:\n\nBoys' Recreation Room\n\nThis room is 37' long 27'6\" wide and 9'6\" high. The lower part of the walls is covered with V-joint lumber placed vertically, and is for the most part in good repair. The upper part was originally plastered, but when this fell off, the School Management covered it with beaver board taken from the hospital which was pulled down last year. The repairs thus effected have never been satisfactory either from the standpoint of durability, or as a means of keeping the room weather-proof. This beaver board should be removed, and the whole of the upper part of the walls covered with lumber laid on horizontally over felt paper to keep out the cold, and the lumber again covered with metallic shingles similar to those which now cover the ceiling of this room. I asked a Winnipeg firm to furnish me with an estimate of the cost of the metallic shingles to cover the area in question, which is approximately 5' wide and 129' long, and their figure was $45.00. I am unable to give you an estimate of the cost of the lumber, but Mr. Waddy stated that it would not amount to very much. In addition to the lumber required for the recreation room itself, a little more will be required for the walls of the stairway leading to this room from the outside entrance. If your Department provided the material,\nthe School Management informed me that they could do\nthe work, and I beg to recommend that Mr. Indian Agent\nWaddy be authorized to have this work taken in hand at\nonce.\n\nThere is always temptation for the bigger boys\nto put paper and other combustible material into any\nopening in the walls, and it is for this reason that I am\nvery anxious to have these repairs effected with the least\npossible delay.\n\nDuring the very severe weather which has pre-\nvailed this winter, the boys had to spend more time than\nusual in their recreation room, with the result that the\nglass in the windows of this room was frequently broken.\nOur Commission, of course, repair all such breakages but\nthey feel that expenditure in this connection might be con-\nsiderably reduced if the windows were protected by heavy\nwire screens. I beg to request, therefore, that your au-\nthorization to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy include this item as\nwell. The expenditure involved would not be very great.\n\nVerandah Screens.\n\nThe upper verandah which runs along the front of\nthe main school building was provided some years ago with\nmosquito screens, but the lower verandah was not supplied\nwith the same protection and the staff and pupils have suf-\nfered very much in consequence. I beg to request, therefore,\nthat authority also be given to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy to have\nthe screens on the upper verandah repaired, and the whole of the\nlower verandah provided with this very necessary protection\nagainst these venomous and very troublesome insects.\n\nInside Toilets\n\nFor some reason or other this school was never pro-\nvided with inside toilets in the basement for the use of either\nthe boys or girls, two outside toilets being provided to take\ntheir place during the day time. This arrangement is very un-\nsatisfactory in many ways, and especially from the standpoint\nof health. As it would not involve a very heavy expenditure\nto have two inside toilets installed, I beg to recommend that\nyour representative be authorized to take the necessary action\nin this respect also.\nCommending the above matters to your careful and sympathetic consideration,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 4)\nOttawa, March 12, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir;\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing five accounts in connection with improvements at the MacKay Indian Residential School. These, with one exception, have already been paid, having been forwarded in the regular way by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy. It is the practice to have accounts forwarded by principals to the Indian Agent, who is in a position to certify to the account and make a recommendation to the Department. This is true, even when authority is directed to the church office, as in this case. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy received a copy of my letter to you of the 26th of June, last. I am returning one copy of the paid accounts for your file.\n\nThe one exception is the Ross Navigation Company account of $9.10, for freighting lumber. This should be forwarded to the Principal of the School, with the request that he explain the nature of the charge to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, who will then present it to the Department if it is in order.\n\nI have also your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to further improvements that appear to be necessary at the MacKay School. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, authorizing repairs to the walls of the boys' recreation room. He will also arrange to screen the windows. I am asking Mr. Waddy for a recommendation, with estimate, in connection with the screening of the lower verandah and the toilets in the basement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst.-Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, March 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., writes that you and he agreed that the walls of the boys' recreation room at the MacKay Indian Residential School should be repaired. You may arrange to have the beaver board removed and lumber laid horizontally over felt paper and covered with metallic shingles, similar to those on the ceiling. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. You may also arrange to put heavy wire screens on the inside of the windows of the boys' recreation room.\n\nDr. Westgate urges that the lower verandah be screened and that the screens of the upper verandah be repaired. Please let me have your recommendation and, if favourable, an estimate of the cost. It is also represented that two inside toilets should be provided in the basement. You might let me have an estimate and recommendation in this connection also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

I have the honor to inform you that the Ross Navigation Company's account for $9.10 has been sent forward to the Principal of the MacKay school with the necessary instructions.\n\nThe Commission were of the opinion that the action set forth in your letter had been taken but were not sure of this and consequently in order to avoid the possibility of accounts for 1928 being submitted after the close of your fiscal year these bills were sent down.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAst.

I think this work should be carried out as at present the staff have no place to use for a sitting room in the summer except inside the building. The screening, lumber, labor etc for this would amount to about $125.00. There are a number of the other screens to be repaired and I beg to recommend that $20.00 of wire screen be supplied for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAast.

You may purchase the screening, lumber and other material required for the purpose. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the screening of the lower verandah, including the material and labour, to be approximately $125, and the repairs required to the other screens, $80.

In reply I beg to say that I have always advocated that the Principal of an Indian Residential School live in a detached residence. That is what I pressed for in connection with the Blood School and also when it was decided to have the teacher in residence at Old Sun's. I would, therefore, advise that a Principal's residence be erected at the McKay School, but I cannot see how it would be possible to erect this building during the coming summer. The material could be taken up there by boat, but there is no proper landing and it would be a very difficult matter to get it unloaded and conveyed to the school. Would it not be better to make arrangements now to have the work of excavating done during the summer and have the material freighted by sleigh during the winter months, and proceed with the work of erection next spring?\n\nWe have several plans of houses here that I think would be suitable for a Principal's residence and the cost should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $7000.00 provided the houses is heated by hot air, which in my opinion is the proper thing for a house situated in the country. I should be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6267, file 580-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 1st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 205-11A C.E. of the 13th ultimo, relative to the erection of a principal's residence at the MacKay Indian Residential School. In this connection, I have noted your opinion regarding the difficulty in having material for the purpose freighted during the summer, and your suggestion that it would be better to make arrangements now to have the work of excavating done, and the material freighted by sleigh during the winter months, and the building proceeded with next Spring.\n\nYou may make the necessary arrangements to have the excavating required carried out, and, if considered advisable, the foundations for the building put in. The school has a good boat, and the school authorities might be prepared to undertake a certain amount of the freighting of the building material required. In any event, you should arrange for the purchase and freighting of the material when considered timely, in order that as much of the material and work can be carried out and accounts rendered in time to be paid from the appropriation provided for the present fiscal year. If you consider that it would be satisfactory, besides the excavation, to have the foundation put in this summer, you may have this portion of the work carried out. If the school authorities cannot freight in any material by boat, you should arrange to have it placed on the ground as early as possible next winter. Certified accounts should be forwarded in the usual manner covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

The need of this building is so very urgent, from the administrative side of our Society's work, that I earnestly hope it may be built and equipped not later than the beginning of next September.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, June 11th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant relative to the building of a residence for the Principal at the Mackay Indian Residential School. In this connection, I have to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham, to whom this matter was referred, stated that it would be impossible to erect this building during the present summer. He recommended that arrangements be made to have the work of excavating carried out and the foundation installed during the summer and that the material be freighted in by sleigh during the winter months and the erection of the building proceeded with next Spring.\n\nMr. Graham was authorized to make the necessary arrangements to have the required excavating carried out and, if it is impossible to have the material freighted in by boat during the summer, he is to have it placed on the ground by sleigh as early as possible next winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st. instant, authorizing me to erect a Principal's residence at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nI may say that Mr. Waddy is here today, preparing to go north tonight. I have discussed this matter with him and his opinion, in which I concur, is that it would be well to let it stand until he comes home. He points out that there will be no Principal at the school during the summer and no one to supervise the work. I feel that if we can start at this building the 1st. of September it could be completed by the 31st. of October. A supervisor will be hired, and the freighting of material, which Mr. Waddy tells me can be done by wagon, will be looked after by the Indians. There are also several handy Indians who can assist the foreman on the building. I propose building a house similar to the residence which was erected for the Agent at Battleford - not exactly the same, but a building of that size, and the cost will be kept as low possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 11th instant, concerning a residence for the Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School. Mr. Graham has now written that he believes the freighting of materials can be effected over the wagon road and he hopes to have the building started by September first and completed in about two months. I am sure this will be more satisfactory to your Society than the earlier arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 21, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A of the 10th instant, with reference to a principal's residence at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I note that this building can be started by the first of September and that whereas the freighting can be done by wagon, you hope to have it completed by the 31st of October. The Department is pleased to learn that this building can be finished this year, and I have to request you to complete the arrangements. No unnecessary expense should be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Perrier, who visited the MacKay Indian Residential School last year, has reported that the main building is badly in need of painting, and I am pleased to inform you that there is an appropriation of $600 for this purpose. Would you please arrange to have the work undertaken at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 27th last, No. 128-1-5, I beg to say that I have had a conversation with Mr. Waddy, and he informs me that it would be a mistake to put paint on the outside of the McKay Boarding School, which painting was authorized in your letter mentioned above. Mr. Waddy tells me that the siding is all separated and that the paper can be seen through the wide cracks between each board. I have instructed that the building be resided with this money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 3, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A C.E. of the 28th ultimo, informing the Department that, in conversation with Mr. Agent Waddy, you had instructed that, instead of painting the outside of the MacKay Indian Residential School, as authorized by official letter of June 27th, last, the building be resided. Your action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am making arrangements at once to have a residence erected for the Principal of the McKay Indian Boarding School, keeping as near to the amount mentioned in your instructions as possible. The bills of material are being figured out here today and the plans are being forwarded to the Agent, so that the work of excavating may be commenced at once and the material will be delivered on the ground immediately.\n\nIt is hoped that when this residence is completed the Department will have some success in obtaining a first-class man as Principal at this school. For years we have had very incompetent men here, and our work has been more or less of a failure. In my opinion, only an experienced and competent man should be employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am now making arrangements to build the Principal's residence at the Mackay Indian Residential School, The Pas Agency, and I shall be glad to receive an acceptable cheque for $2,000.00 to pay for labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that the fire-proof slabs above the flue leading from the Furnace of the MacKay Indian Residential School have broken down and should be replaced immediately.\n\nI beg to recommend that I be allowed to supply 22 lineal feet of 1\" thick Asbestos, 2' 6\" wide.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the fireproof slabs above the flue leading from the furnace at the Mackay Indian Residential School, I have to say that you may purchase and supply 22 lineal feet of 1\" thick asbestos, and arrange for any repairs required to the furnace to be carried out. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and, when the work is completed, you should forward a certified voucher in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:\n\nMay I please be furnished with an accountable cheque for $350.00 to be used in connection with the re-siding of the MacKay Indian school in the Pas Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

G. Tweddell, Indian agent, advising me that the work is progressing satisfactorily and that the carpenters are doing a first class job, but it is taking more time than was at first anticipated on account of having to draw every nail in the old siding before the new siding can be put on. It will, therefore, cost more than was anticipated. Mr. Waddy advised me that he thought it could be done for the $800.00 authorized, but now I find that it will cost from $1,025.00 to $1,050.00. As the carpenters were on the work, I had no alternative but to authorize this expenditure. I trust that the Department will approve of my action in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Fritchard, for labour and material supplied in connection with the Principal's residence, MacKay School, as shown on the vouchers, and accompanied by Mr. Fritchard's various tenders.\n\nThe arrangement for the work was prepared by Mr. Waddy after consultation with The Pas City Engineer, and was done at a per foot basis for excavation of water line and septic tank, and cubic yard basis for cellar. The excavating is done through limestone shale and has to be picked - not a loose shovelful of material in the whole job. This is making the excavation work very expensive.

The house is 24 x 26, with 4 bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs and 1 small bedroom, kitchen, pantry, dining-room, living room and hall downstairs. The work, up to the present, has been well done, and the house, no doubt, will be warm and comfortable. The difficulties experienced in digging the septic tank and outlet have been very expensive, due to the rock formations. I instructed the Principal to have all drains and outlets covered with manure and old hay to prevent freezing, and if these instructions are carried out, I do not think any trouble will be experienced.\nAssignment of Moneys Due from Particular Contracts or Accounts.\n\nIn Consideration of advances now and hereafter to be made by The Royal Bank of Canada to the undersigned, the undersigned hereby assign, transfer and set over unto The Royal Bank of Canada all moneys, claims, rights and demands whatsoever which the undersigned may now, or at any time hereafter, have or be entitled to in respect of or incidental to or resulting from the following contracts, agreements or accounts and in respect of interest, costs and expenses in connection therewith namely:\n\nContract for excavating pipe laying, etc., at MacKay Indian School, tender for which was accepted by J.

There is some plumbing being done and should be looked over in the near future.\n\nEverything was in A1 condition other than the 2 small overlooks.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SGD) A.Gardiner.\nNovember 19th, 1929.\n\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nDominion Government,\nOttawa, ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach copy of letter received from A. Gardiner, who is the Building Inspector for the Town of The Pas, which has reference to the new industrial school being built at Big Eddy.\n\nThe circumstances in connection with the matter are that we were asked to inspect the wiring in this building from a fire prevention point of view, and made arrangements with Mr. Gardiner to do so, and you will note that with the exception of one or two defects the wiring is all right, and that Mr. Gardiner now offers to inspect the plumbing.\n\nThere is no Provincial legislation dealing with plumbing, and I have so advised Mr. Gardiner, but I thought possibly you would like to make use of his services.\n\nReference is made to the brass rod fire escape system.

W. HILL  \nThe Pas.  \nMan.\n\nW. G. Tweddell, Esq.,  \nIndian Agent,  \nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your request of yesterday, I duly visited the McKay School and have the following report:\n\n\"The wiring in Mr. Turner's room does not show any defects. There is a small amount of current between conduit and one side of circuit, also between steam pipes and one side of circuit, but not sufficient to cause a fire. This is due to induction, as there is no short circuit.\n\nThe wiring for the top floor is not in conduit (in the attic), but should be as the ceiling is metal lathed, and knob & tube wiring is not allowable where metal lath or metallic ceiling is employed.\n\nThis constitutes a fire hazard and I consider it possible for a small arc to exist between the end of metal lath and building paper on the outside wall, connection to earth being made by frost or dampness on the paper, carrying the current. This would burn slowly, and a small portion of smoldering paper falling down between walls to plate on next floor could cause a fire. There is some evidence of the metal lath being heated at one spot, and there was fire between the studding.\n\nOutside of this I could not detect anything likely to cause the fire from the Electrical Service.\n\nI noticed that all the lighting outlets on the conduit sections have metal covers with unbushed holes for the drop cord. This is incorrect as in time the insulation will wear and cause a short. In several places the drop cord shows sign of wearing.\n\nI found some joints in wiring not soldered.\n\nIt is peculiar that the Top Floor is wire in knob & tube, while the basement, first and second floors are wire in conduit.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that the top floor be properly wired in conduit, and the whole conduit system bonded together and efficiently grounded.\n\nThe metal covers on lighting outlet boxes replaced with porcelain covers, the drop cord examined throughout, and also the joints in wiring.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd) Chas. W. Hill.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing a report from Mr. Hill, electrician which will explain itself.\n\nI thought it would be much better to have inspection done by an expert, and if there was any defect in the wiring it could be remedied at your discretion, and prevent any recurrence of the trouble.\n\nI presume that the buildings are insured and that an inspector will view the building, so as to fix damages etc.\n\nIn the meantime I can assure you that all necessary precautions are being observed.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that everybody worked well including the carpenters, Dr. Robertson and the children were splendid.\n\nThe water supply from the pumps was poor as the cylinder is out of order. It seems that this cannot be remedied as the cylinder is down 62 feet and is joined to the casing. The only remedy would seem to be a new well drilled.\n\nHappily the fire started at noon otherwise it might have been more serious.\n\nI would estimate damage at $500.00.\n\nAwaiting your approval and instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. G. Tweddell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. W. G. Tweddell, dated the 21st December, with the enclosure from Mr. Hill, the electrician to whom he refers. Mr. Tweddell telegraphed me on the 19th instant, reporting a fire which had taken place at the Mackay School, and indicating that a report was following, and I take it that the latter, copy of which I now enclose, purports to be Mr. Tweddell's report. I am requesting him to submit fuller information in regard to the outbreak of the fire. In the meanwhile, it would appear that the repairs intimated by the electrician should be carried out to ensure the safety of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 30, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A C.E. of the 24th instant, with enclosures, relative to a recent fire at the MacKay Indian Residential School. When you receive the full report regarding the outbreak, please forward it to the Department.

Mr. Fraser had been in Mr. Turner's room just a short time before, and there was no sign of fire there then. Miss Cole who was sick and confined to her room smelled smoke first and gave the alarm.\n\nIt seems impossible to give an exact cause, no fire was being used in the rooms as they are heated by steam. As the fire was between the walls the only source from which it could emanate would be the wiring or spontaneous combustion. Mr. Turner claims that the power was off at the time, as he was charging the batteries, but fire could smolder for a long time before it would flame. Boxed in between the walls once it broke into flame it would form a draft and spread rapidly.\n\nMy estimate of damages given you was a liberal one on account of claim for insurance. The damage is caused more by tearing, chopping and water - which was not spared. Mr. Turner's room has a metal ceiling which is not much damaged but Miss Cole's room was a plaster ceiling and the water has made it all fall so that it will have to be replastered also some of the walls in both rooms. A small portion of the floor in each room has been chopped and in such shape that we will have to be taken up for repairs. I do not think that the joists are much damaged, merely charred, that is where they can be seen.\n\nI have again discussed the wiring and probable sources of fire with Mr. Hill and he states that he cannot definitely place the cause of the fire but considers the wiring unsafe especially on the top floor where it does not comply with regulations. I have asked Mr. Hill to make a report suggesting the repairs and alterations required also the cost of same which I will forward to you as soon as possible. Mr. J. S. Dickens is the only other electrician in The Pas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. G. Tweddell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Tweddell, Indian Agent at the Pas, concerning the outbreak of fire at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I have directed the agent to repair the damage that has been done and when he forwards me an estimate of the cost of repairing the wiring system, I will send it on to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise the Department that I am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent informing me that the senior classroom in the MacKay Indian Residential School has burlap instead of wainscot and this is full of holes and unsightly.

Dickens Co., Ltd., The Pas, for work incurred during my absence on Treaty, at the MacKay School for $103.10.\n\nThe water in the well for the school became contaminated from the pipe leading from the old hospital. This pipe ran from the hospital into the Power House, where the well is situated. When the hospital was demolished, the pipe should have been taken up or cemented in. This was not done at the time, and has caused this trouble and expense.\n\nI am informed by the Principal, that a good job has been done, and no further trouble may be expected from that source.\n\nI may say that Mr. Fraser had the water analysed,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nSept. 8th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHeating Plant at MacKay School\n\nI beg to inform you that I received a letter from Rev. Fraser, principal of the MacKay School, requesting that certain repairs be done to the heating plant and a new plate or arch be put in the fire box.\n\nMr. Turner, the school engineer informed me that a plate would cost about $200.00, however I visited the school with Mr. Sheddon and made an inspection with the following results.\n\nBy putting in some fire brick and fire clay the plate would last for a year or more. Recovering 4\" steam pipe in boy's play room with three ply asbestos pipe covering, with asbestos cement fittings on steam main. Taking down radiator at rear entrance door, and refitting same in boy's lavatory. Boring and retapping radiation where necessary and fitting new air vents to same. Repacking all valves on radiators with asbestos packing. Altering steam risers at front of building, cutting and refitting same. The radiator in the boy's lavatory, is up at the ceiling, and is far too small. The one at the rear entrance is useless there, owing to the door being opened so much. The valves freeze and burst, so I thought it would be better to remove it and put it in the boy's lavatory. The entrance for valves in radiators are all eroded and leak steam, causing the flooring to raise. Mr. Sheddon offers to do all the repairs and furnish all material necessary for the sum of $145.00.\n\nI beg to submit that this work is necessary.\n\nKindly instruct me if this offer is acceptable, or if I should call for tenders as there is one other plumber here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. W. G. Tweddell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received today from Mr. W. G. Tweddell, with reference to the necessity of repairing the heating plant at the MacKay Indian School. Will you please advise me if I should instruct the Agent to carry out the proposed alterations suggested by Mr. Sheddon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A C.E. of the 10th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Agent Tweedell, The Pas, regarding the repairs required to the heating plant at the Mackay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the alterations as mentioned in letter of Mr. Agent Tweedell carried out. It is noted that the cost of this work, including all material and labour, will be $145.00. As the season is getting late, I shall be pleased if you will have the repairs and alterations carried out at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. F.

Authorities differ as to the amount of free chlorine that should be in a water to insure its freedom from microbes of disease, but in general we believe that 0.10 p.p.m. (parts per million) of free chlorine ten minutes after treatment will be sufficient. Obviously too much might cause tastes while too little would impair bacteriological efficiency. It is suggested in all cases that the State Department of Health be consulted concerning the desired amount of free chlorine. The importance of the free chlorine content of a water and the desirability of making quick and accurate tests, led to the development of the W & T Ortho-Tolidin Testing Outfit.\n\nWhen ortho-tolidin solution is introduced into a water containing free chlorine the water turns yellow or orange,\u2014the intensity of the color varying with the amount of free chlorine. The W & T Ortho-Tolidin Testing Outfit is a simple, scientifically calibrated device permitting the operator to match the color of the ortho-tolidin treated water against a known color standard and interpret the results in parts per million of free chlorine.\n\nf.o.b. Newark, N. J. See illustration on last page.\nDESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT\n\nThe outfit consists of a two-tube color comparator with a small transparent gauging tube, calibrated both to measure ortho-tolidin solution and to indicate free chlorine in parts per million. One of the color comparator tubes has a colorless glass base while the other is fitted with a colored glass which corresponds to a value of 0.05 parts of chlorine per million.\n\nThe color comparator tubes are opaque, the interior walls being threaded. This construction eliminates the errors due to light refraction which are experienced when glass tubes are used and also overcomes difficulties in reading due to reflected light from the sides of the tubes.\n\nEach of the comparator tubes is fitted with a small valve at its base for lowering the level of the solution in the tube. This fundamental feature makes it possible, when comparing colors, to look through the same depth of liquid in both tubes and eliminates any error due to the natural color of the water being tested.\n\nFor convenience in carrying, a third tube is assembled with the comparator tubes and serves as a reservoir for the ortho-tolidin solution.\n\nDescriptive Operation of the W&T Ortho-Tolidin Testing Outfit\n\nFig. 1\u2014Have both comparator tubes \"A\" and \"B\" empty and clean. Hold testing outfit as shown and fill both comparator tubes within about one-half inch of the top with the water to be tested.\n\nNote\u2014The sample may be taken at such a point in the distribution system that ten minutes has elapsed since the introduction of chlorine, or the sample may be taken nearer the point of treatment and stored sufficiently long to give the ten minute contact period desired before filling the comparator tubes. In cold weather this ten minute period should be extended to fifteen minutes.\n\nFig. 2\u2014Hold the transparent gauging pipette with the figures right side up, between the thumb and third finger, and the stopper from the ortho-tolidin reservoir between the thumb and the second finger. Insert the pipette in the ortho-tolidin reservoir. Place the forefinger securely over the top of the pipette, raise it out of the solution and by admitting air at the top by a slight releasing of the forefinger, drain solution from pipette back into the ortho-tolidin reservoir until the solution level in the pipette is opposite the red 1 c.c. mark. Introduce this 1 c.c. of ortho-tolidin solution into tube \"A\" (having the plain glass base).\n\nFig. 3\u2014Securely replace the stopper in the ortho-tolidin reservoir, cover the comparator tubes with the palm of the hand, and invert repeatedly to insure thorough mixing. Allow to stand until the maximum color develops, which requires from one to two minutes, before making the color comparison. (In cold weather this interval should be extended to five minutes).\n\nFig. 4\u2014The color of the solution in tube \"A\" (having the plain glass base) indicates the amount of free chlorine in the water. Lower the level of the solution in tube \"A\", by opening the valve at the bottom until it approximately matches the color in tube \"B\" (having the colored glass base). Now draw down the level of the solution in tube \"B\" until its level approximately equals that in tube \"A\". Now, make a second adjustment of the level in tube \"A\", to match the color in tube \"B\". In comparing colors hold the comparator tubes over a white surface, such as a piece of paper.\n\nFig. 5\u2014With the colors matched insert the transparent gauging pipette in tube \"A\" with the figures right side up, until it touches the plain glass bottom. Place the forefinger securely over the top of the pipette, raise it up and read the calibration opposite the level of the liquid. This calibration indicates the free chlorine in parts per million.\n\nFig. 6\u2014Empty and thoroughly rinse both comparator tubes.\nTHE W&T ORTHO-TOLIDIN TESTING OUTFIT IS SHIPPED IN AN ATTRACTIVE LEATHER CASE 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" IN DIAMETER AND 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" LONG AND WEIGHS LESS THAN ONE POUND\n\nWALLACE & TIERNAN COMPANY, INCORPORATED NEWARK, NEW JERSEY WALLACE & TIERNAN, LIMITED TORONTO - CANADA\nTHE W&T CHLORO-CLOCK\n\nTHIS is an equipment for feeding small quantities of sterilizing solution. It operates on the displacement principle, the control being obtained from a clock-work mechanism which actuates an arm from which a displacing cylinder is suspended. The rate of feed of solution is adjusted by means of a pendulum lever and is arranged so that the contents of the cylinder container can be discharged at varying rates as required from 20 hours to 8 days. A water supply under pressure feeds the small constant level box into which the solution drops. The same water supply also operates an injector which draws from the constant level box and applies the diluted sterilizing solution to the desired point of application.\n\nThe Chloro-Clock is started in operation by turning on the water supply and moving a lever which starts the clock mechanism in motion.

C. Lindsten\nMr. J. J. Twindell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 15, in regard to chlorine equipment for the McKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn checking over the data sheet which you were kind enough to fill out, we find that this job is a little out of the ordinary for the reason that we are not able to apply the chlorine at the suction side of the pump. Therefore, it will be necessary to include extra equipment such as a booster pump, motor, and a high pressure injector on the chlorinator. The booster pump is needed to give us a 120# pressure to operate the high pressure injector to carry the sterilizing solution from the chlorinator to the discharge side of the pump.\n\nWe are attaching hereto our proposal covering the furnishing and installing of one of our Chloro-Clocks and extra equipment needed for treating the water at the McKay Indian Residential School, all for the sum of $1473.00. We are also attaching hereto our Technical Publications #77 and #54.\n\nIf we can be of any further service, do not hesitate to call upon us. We trust we will hear from you shortly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. WALLACE & TIERMAN LIMITED.\n\nH. O. Lindsten\nDistrict Manager.\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time since, the Rev. A. Fraser, Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, reported to me that the water at the school was bad.\n\nI had the Provincial sanitary Inspector, Mr. Flattery, visit the school and take samples of the water from the well and from the supply tank. Upon analysis the water showed a count of over 10,000 bacteria per c.c. and colon bacilli positive 1 c.c. and 5 c.c. Samples were again taken on September 17th, 1930 which resulted as follows:\n\n| Tap Water | Colon Bacilli Positive Over 25000 Bacterial Plate Count | c.c. |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Well      |                                                        | 10000|\n\nThis showed the water was considerably worse, and also showed that the water was not properly chlorinated.\n\nOn October 7th, I again visited the school with Mr. Flattery who again demonstrated to the staff the proper method of chlorinating the water, and I have had no complaint since.\n\nIn the meantime I have had the pupils and staff inoculated as a precautionary measure.\n\nAs Mr. Flattery advised me that the only safe measure was to put in a Wallace & Tiernan chlorinator, I thought it advisable to get a price on it. I enclose herewith correspondence from these people who state the full installation of same would cost $1473.00.\n\nIn the meantime I shall watch closely to see the process of chlorinating is properly carried out.\n\nTrusting this has your approval.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

As there is no means of checking the amount of water pumped at the well it is no use attempting to sterilize with chloride of lime at the well. Two large tanks have been provided, one three barrel tank in the kitchen and one barrel in Mr. Fraser's residence.\n\nChloride of lime is added and the water tested each time. I took a sample from the kitchen tank and from the tap.\n\nThe result of the examination of the samples were as follows:\n\n| Colon Bacilli | Bacterial Plate Count per c.c. |\n|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| Kitchen Tap   | negative                       | 1000                           |\n| Water Tank    | negative                       | 0                              |\n\nIf further samples have the same result as above there will be no need of a chlorinator, but if future samples are positive the only measure will be the installation of a chlorinator.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd.

The senior room is in charge of Miss Farrow, with an enrolment of 46 pupils, and the junior room with Miss Scott as teacher, with an enrolment of 40 pupils. These ladies are both qualified teachers, and use good methods in presenting the work. The children write well and appear to be fairly well along in their respective grades. However, these children will not speak out, and it is almost impossible to hear them read or answer any question. The discipline is only fair, and the children are very\nare very lax in their carriage and manner of standing. Both the teachers are small of stature, which is somewhat a handicap in their endeavour to enforce discipline. I find this slackness throughout the institution, which no doubt increases the difficulty of enforcing proper discipline in the classroom.\n\nThe girls were neatly dressed and clean in appearance. The boys were a rough and ready lot, and it appeared as though little interest had been shown in their personal appearance, either by themselves or any member of the staff.\n\nThe classrooms are large and roomy with plenty of light and fresh air.\n\nThe building throughout was clean, and the windows all in good repair.\n\nThe dormitories I found to be clean. The beds were all neatly made, and I understand all bedding is washed every two weeks. Both the boys and girls are provided with nightgowns in which to sleep. The mattresses are in bad condition. Many have been re-covered, but this does not do away with the strong undesirable odour which I detected on entering the dormitories. New mattresses are badly needed.\n\nThe outside windows were all on, which makes ventilation more difficult. Two of the windows in each dormitory, facing on the large verandah, might have the upper half without glass, and these would need to be heavily screened so as to prevent the children escaping during the night. The inside windows could then either be raised or lowered from the top, as desired, in order\n\nto prevent\nto prevent draught. I believe this arrangement would greatly improve conditions.\n\nThe fire escapes have been improved by the new steps leading down on the verandahs from each dormitory. The water supply is good, but it is difficult, with the present pump, to keep up the pressure when once the fire hose are in use. There is one large fire extinguisher in the hall on the first, second and third story, but I think one should be supplied for the kitchen and one for the bakery, which is in the basement. I understand fire drill is observed, but I believe it should be practiced more often, especially at night.\n\nThe soft water cistern is in the basement. It is built in the middle of a large room, and the walls are about 6 ft. high. A small platform is built along one side, about 4 ft. high, on which the children stand in order to bail the water from the cistern. This is a dangerous arrangement, and the entire cistern, which is about 10' x 10' square, should be covered with plank and a proper pump supplied.\n\nThe tables in the children's dining room should be covered, as the boards have dried apart, and it is difficult to keep them clean and sanitary. Two or three of the tables, along with other furniture, came from the old Battleford institution and are past repair. These should be renewed. The walls leading to the entrance of the kitchen and the boys' playroom should be repaired. The plaster is off in places, and I think if these walls were covered with metallic sheeting, it would prevent further destruction and also lessen danger from fire.\n\nThere are\nThere are a number of places throughout the building where the plaster needs to be repaired, and this work should be carried out before any interior decorating is done. The building should be decorated throughout as the place is dark and gloomy, and has had little painting done for a number of years. The roof leaks in two places and this should be repaired at once as it is effecting the plaster and will cause it to fall. The roof could no doubt be patched for the present, although the shingles do not look good and it may be found necessary to re-shingle it in the near future.\n\nThe water supply has become contaminated, and it is necessary to treat it before being used. The last test showed it to be free of germs, but the treatment will need to be continued until further tests are made. I noticed the water trough for all the stock is just outside the pump house, and the stock coming there for water keeps the place dirty. I think if the water were piped to the barn and this trough removed, with the surroundings thoroughly cleaned, some of the trouble might be overcome. I understand there is a pipe line to the barn, but no one knows why the use of it had been discontinued. No doubt it froze at the barn, after which the trough was removed to its present location by the well.\n\nThe barn was clean and all tools neatly put away. The floor of the barn is badly worn in places, and should be renewed. A new chicken house has been erected, and next year Mr. Fraser said a start would be made to keep poultry. At present they have none.\n\nI saw the horses and cattle, and their condition has greatly improved. I believe they are receiving some care and attention, and this year they have obtained\nabout 100 loads of hay, so that no shortage should occur. The present bull has been at the school four years, and should be disposed of.\n\nThe meals provided are plain, but well cooked. The breakfast consists of porridge with sugar and milk when possible, also bread with lard or butter, and tea. At noon, the meal consists of meat or fish with potatoes, carrots or some other vegetable. Bread and tea are also given. The supper consists of boiled puddings (rice or batter pudding), Johnny cake, bread, grease and tea. The children looked well, and I believe receive plenty of whatever is served.\n\nThe staff consists of the following members:\n\n| Position                  | Name                      |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Principal                 | Rev. A. Fraser            |\n| Mechanic                  | Mr. Turner                |\n| Farming Instructor        | Mr. White                 |\n| Night Watchman            | Mr. Fraser (Principal's Son) |\n| Matron                    | Miss Warnener             |\n| Sr. Teacher               | Miss Farrow               |\n| Jr. Teacher               | Miss Scott                |\n| Boys' Matron              | Miss Griffiths             |\n| Laundry Matron            | Miss Northwood            |\n| Kitchen Matron            | Mrs. Evans                |\n| Sewing Matron             | Miss Fraser (Principal's daughter) |\n\nI found many improvements made during the last year, and the building and yards are in better condition, and yet there is room for vast improvement.\n\nThe boys have no supervision during recreation hours, and apparently are left to run wild. They are ill-mannered, and I do not think the staff have much control. I believe if a proper boys' supervisor were secured, and he would need to be a real man, it would be a big step towards handling the children. This would also strengthen the authority of the other members, who at present find themselves often unable\noften unable to control the children. This situation applies to both the girls and boys. To my mind this is the weak spot of the institution, and until someone is placed in charge or made a member of the staff, who can handle children and enforce discipline, the object of the school will be defeated.\n\nI find Mr. Fraser, the Principal, apparently willing to carry out any suggestions, and considering the condition existing when he assumed control, less than a year ago, progress has been made. He is not, however, a disciplinarian, and as a result, the children are not receiving the training along this line which they much require. A man as boys' supervisor, who is a disciplinarian, would make a vast difference in the tone of the institution, and I think the other members would find it less difficult to control the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on The Pas Agency by Inspector Hamilton.\n\nWith reference to the Pas Indian Day School, you will note the Inspector says that the school building needs exterior painting and that the teacher's residence is also in need of painting outside. I may say that amounts have been provided in the Estimates to meet these expenditures.\n\nI wish to draw to your attention that part of the Inspector's report which deals with the situation of the soft water cistern. There is danger here and it should be remedied.\n\nYou will also note the Inspector's remarks in regard to the tables in the dining room of the MacKay School. There is an item of $800.00 in the Estimates to repair the dining room floor and other work. You will also note that the water supply is not fit for use. There is also an item of $400.00 in the Estimates to repair the barn floor and paint it. I cannot say that the report is very encouraging. The new Principal, Mr. A. Fraser, has been a disappointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have your 205-11 of the 20th instant, enclosing Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools of The Pas Agency. Two additional fire extinguishers will be supplied for the MacKay Indian Residential School. Will you arrange to have soft water cistern in the basement covered and a pump installed. Next year it is the intention to supply a chlorinator to make the water supply safe. A vote will also be secured to fix up the dining room tables, etc. I hope there will be funds next year for the repairing of the barn floor.\n\nI am writing to the church authorities with a view to securing a strong disciplinarian as boys' supervisor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Since it was an Indian Department School and Residence - I am sure these people were slow in getting this account to your Office - I hope everything is all right with the exception of the Assistant Charge threading the pipe.\n\nThanking you - Yours faithfully,\n\nA. Principal.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nNovember 27th, 1930\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInclosed please find bills from Frost Bros., together with a letter from the Rev. Fraser, Principal, of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas.\n\nThis letter would place the blame for the delay in presenting the bill upon Frost Bros., however I have interviewed Mr. Sheddon, who has taken over Frost Brothers business here. He informs me that his instructions from Mr. Fraser was to charge this bill to the Church Commission, and that Mr. Fraser received a bill once each month, but took no notice of them.\n\nMr. Fraser had no authority from me for this expenditure, therefore I had no knowledge of such a transaction, till now.\n\nThe hot water tank was installed in the contract for plumbing, but no provisions made for connecting it with the range which was purchased and put in later by authority from Commissioner W.M. Graham, Regina.\n\nThough the bill was contracted without authority it appears to be chargeable to the Department.\n\nMr. Sheddon explains the overcharge for threading pipes, thus. A diagram was sent to him, giving lengths of pipes to be cut and threaded and fitted to couplings, ready to put in place by Mr. Turner, mechanic at the school.\n\nThis to me does not look to be an overcharge.\n\nI am sending two copies of the bill, unsigned, for your consideration and instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

No doubt, the expenditure of a considerable sum would be necessary if it were to be put in perfect condition.\n\nThere have been several changes in principalship at this school of recent years, as none was proving satisfactory, and it is entirely probable that the building was not kept in good repair. A departmental Inspector visited the school last fall and reported that the plaster needed repairs in several places and that the rooms would have to be redecorated. The dining room tables need recovering and new flooring is required in a few of the rooms and in the main barn.\n\nThere is an item of $1,200 in the Main Estimates for these purposes. It is also proposed to provide a chlorinator for the water supply and to give the school a motor truck, as there is now a decent road to The Pas.\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton reports that, in the near future, it will be necessary to reroof the main building; but, as this is the first time it has been brought to the Department's attention, I consider that this repair could be postponed until next year.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n| Item                  | Quantity | Price  |\n|-----------------------|----------|--------|\n| Footballs             | 2        | $3.75  |\n| Basketballs           | 2        | $8.25  |\n| Playground Balls      | 2        | $1.30  |\n\nTotal: $26.60\n\nCertified correct; supplies furnished; charges fair and just.\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Therein it is intimated that (1.) new nipples are required in the return main, (2.) new arch is needed over the fire door, (3) that the boiler will have to be partly reset. This appears to be an old Vulcan Iron Works boiler built in 1915. It seems to me that repairs of this nature should be undertaken by the school authorities. Please advise me so that I may communicate with the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A C.E. of the 15th instant, regarding the repairs required to the boiler at the MacKay Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that the Department usually provides the cost of repairs to mechanical equipment, and I have to request that you will obtain and forward to Ottawa an estimate of the cost of carrying out the repairs to the boiler, as mentioned in your letter.

It is proposed to repair or renew the dining room tables and to replace part of the flooring in the barn at this school this year. Further, it is necessary to arrange for the chlorination of the domestic water supply, and there was provided $1,700 in the Appropriation for Indian Education for these purposes.\n\nThe improvements mentioned are really urgent and I believe they should be proceeded with. This will mean that the painting will have to stand until next year, unless we find that it can be included for the amount provided. I should be pleased if you would let me have the name of a competent carpenter, who could take charge of the repairs to the dining room tables and the barn floor. When this work is nearing completion, it will then be determined whether or not the painting can be done this year. You might also indicate the name of the firm from which we should purchase the lumber.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nB. M. Stitt, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your 205-11A C.S. of May 27th, 1931, re boiler at the MacKay Indian Residential School, the Pas, I beg to say that I had Mr. C. Dickens, a competent man, visit the school and inspect this boiler.\n\nI have his report and estimate of cost, as below:\n\n1. Fire brick inside all more or less burned out, and need replacing with new fire brick and fire clay.\n2. The Arch over the fire door is burned out. New one required.\n3. Outside wall on one side of the boiler is bulged and cracked needs to be torn out and re-built.\n4. The Return pipe is rusted through and needs replacing with new one.\n5. The three pet-cooks on gauge glass are badly damaged and out of order. These need replacing and plug at bottom of same is broken in and needs drilling out and retapping.\n6. The front frame of boiler is broken and needs Acetelene welding.\n7. Hinges on clean out door of boiler are broken. Need replacing.\n8. The piping on domestic supply of hot water, near jacket heater is rusted and leaks, needs replacing.\n\n\"Generally speaking the whole thing is in poor shape and needs attention badly\"\n\nAll of the above repairs I will be pleased to carry out for the sum of $355.00 (Three Hundred and Fifty Five Dollars) provided no other repairs develop, that cannot be seen at present, and if this should happen, I will immediately report before proceeding to do any work, other than stated above\".\n\nThe arch, I understand, will cost Mr. Dickens $75. to $80. Winnipeg, and with freight and drayage will be in the neighborhood of $100.00.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. W. G. Tweddell,\nIndian agent\n\nW. M.

BUSKARD,\n\nRepairs are needed to the heating boiler of the MacKay Indian Residential School near The Pas, Man. The Indian Agent engaged Mr. C. Dickens, of The Pas, whom he described as a competent person to visit the school and inspect the boiler and to prepare an estimate of the cost. The repairs involve an expenditure of $355. Will it be satisfactory to have Mr. Dickens undertake the work? If not, please let me have the name of a boiler maker in The Pas whom we could engage.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nFunds are now available to make certain repairs at the MacKay Indian Residential School. In Mr. Inspector Hamilton's last report, he recommended that the tables in the children's dining room be covered and two or three of them replaced, as they were beyond repair. Battleship linoleum has been found suitable for covering dining room tables. It is also reported that the floor of the barn should be repaired. I also understand that one or two places on the roof need repairing.\n\nPlease engage Mr. Hugh Inkster, of The Pas, to undertake these repairs. The materials should be purchased from the Beaver Lumber Company. Soon after Mr. Inkster starts the work, he should let you have an estimate of the total cost of these improvements so that the Department can determine what other work, if any, can be authorized at this school.\n\nSteps are being taken by the Department to arrange for the installation of a chlorinator, and Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham has been written regarding the repairs to the boiler.

You may have Mr. C. Dickens, of The Pas, undertake the work mentioned in your letter, at a cost of $255. His estimate should not be exceeded, as our funds are extremely limited. In due course, please forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, showing in some detail the work that was undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nFunds are now available for the installation of a chlorinator at the MacKay Indian Residential School. You will remember there has been some correspondence in this connection. As funds are quite low and a saving should be effected, if at all possible, would you consider trying one of the less expensive installations?\nJuly 10, 1931.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Buskard.\n\nThe Department was advised last October that the water supply system at the MacKay Indian Residential School at The Pas, Man., was undrinkable. After having samples of this water analysed by the Provincial Health Officer it was found that the water was polluted, and that the only safe way of sterilizing it would be by means of a Chlorinator.\n\nUpon further investigating the condition of the water the Indian Agent was advised that an installation which would ensure complete sterilization of the water supply in the School would cost in the neighborhood of $1,500.00.\n\nAs it is essential that the above mentioned Institution be provided with safe and dependable drinking water it is suggested that a chlorinating equipment of the type manufactured by Wallace and Tierman of Toronto, (W. & T. Chlor-Clock) be installed. An apparatus of this kind would cost between $1,400.00 and $1,500.00 including its installation. This apparatus comprises the furnishing of a testing outfit for the proper supervision of the water, etc.\n\nAs I am advised that the apparatus supplied by the firm of Wallace and Tierman is thoroughly dependable and well known all over the country, I should like to be advised whether this firm should be invited to submit a proposal and quotation on an apparatus which would meet the requirements of the above mentioned Institution, and the order placed with them if their price is satisfactory.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI discussed the matter hereunder with the Minister and am now returning your file with the request that you please inform him that \u00a31,700 was specially provided for improvements at this school, as indicated in his letter to Mr. Stitt of the 19th ultimo. It is believed that the carpenter work will cost approximately \u00a3400. \u00a31,500 for the chlorinator exceeds the appropriation by \u00a3200, which amount, together with \u00a3355 for emergent boiler repairs, has been charged to the general miscellaneous item in the Vote.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.128-1-5 of the 29th ultimo, re repairs at the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, I beg to inform you that Mr. H. Inkster, has now started the work.\n\nThere are nine tables, 5 of them he is renewing completely, 3 he is renewing all except the legs, and the other one requires a new rail. The floor in the barn is being renewed, also 15 windows and the four doors are being repaired. The barn is roughly 60 x 30\n\nThese repairs will cost approximately $750.00.\n\nRe the roof, as this was in a really bad condition, I had Mr. Inkster, give me a report on this to be submitted to you before he did anything to it, and below I list Mr. Inkster's report.\n\n\"The shingles on the roof are in a very poor condition. They are of very poor quality to begin with. They have been on for 18 years without any preservative, and are now so badly split, broken and loose, that to attempt any repairs would be a waste of time and material. The East and South sides, on account of being more exposed to the sun, are in the worst condition, and that is where the worst leaks occur. The roof is T shaped, of hip and valley design, so that any section can be renewed without molesting the rest of the roof. To strip the sections mentioned repair flashing and lay with tar paper and 1st Grade Shingles, would cost about $350.00, and to do the whole roof in like manner $870.00 Using dipped shingles, the cost would be about $100.00 more for the two sections mentioned, and about $250.00 more for the whole roof. It would however be more economical to do the whole roof at once, as otherwise the ridge boards on hips would have to be removed twice, and the scaffolding is also quite an item.\"\n\nMr. Inkster also reported the floors in the kitchen, dining-room and Junior Class-room, were heaved and are in really a dangerous condition. These are maple floors, and the school have a supply of maple boards on hand, that could be used for repairing. Mr. Inkster stated an approximate cost on the labor for repairing these floors would be $50.00\n\nAwaiting your further instructions.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the repairs required to the roof at the MacKay Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost. In reply I have to say that the Department has no funds available this year to provide the cost of reshingling the roof of this building but an item will be noted in our estimates for the next fiscal year to cover the amount required for this purpose.\n\nThere are no funds available to provide for the cost of labour in repairing the floors in the kitchen, diningroom and junior classroom. It is noted that there is a supply of maple flooring on hand and it is thought that the school authorities could, if same is urgent, perform the labour in repairing these floors.\n\nIt is noted that the work of repairing the tables in the children's diningroom and renewing the flooring in the barn, etc., is now under way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Chloro-Clock Chlorinator, equipped with high pressure injector for feeding small quantities of sterilizing solution, the price to include the services and travelling expenses of one of your Engineers to supervise the installation of the apparatus at the MacKay Indian Residential School, the Pas, Man., also cost of freight.\n\nI may say for your information that the present water supply system is such that it will not be possible to supply the chlorine solution at the suction side of the pump, and it will therefore be necessary to install extra equipment such as a Booster pump, electric motor, and high pressure injector on the Chlorinating apparatus in order to give the necessary pressure to operate the injector, which is to carry the sterilizing solution from the chlorinator to the discharge side of the pump.\n\nThe above mentioned quotation should comprise the furnishing of one Ortho-Felldin Testing outfit for the determining of the amount of residue of chlorine in the water, and it should be understood that the whole installation will be guaranteed for one year.\n\nAs it is urgent that an installation for the sterilization of the water supply at the above mentioned school be made I should like to be furnished with your proposal and quotation with the least possible delay.\n\nShould you require any further information with regard to the condition of the water supply system I would advise you to communicate with Indian Agent W.

Pritchard clean out the sewer and tank.\n\nAs the tank had never been cleaned since it was built it was a formidable job.\n\nTo explain more fully, this tank is not septic, simply a tank about 7' x 6 and 6' below the entry of pipe, with a wall or division in the tank. However the sewer and tank are now in good shape, and should be for some time.\n\nMr. Pritchard's first bill was for $127.50. I considered this excessive and after some discussion he agreed to reduce the amount to $113.50, a reduction of $14.00. Mr. Pritchard's bills are attached herewith also a bill for lime for the tank of $4.00 from the Beaver Lumber Co. Ltd.\n\nThe man-holes on the sewer from the school to the septic tank are away below the surface. This is a serious drawback in locating any stoppage in the sewer. I am not suggesting that this should be remedied at present, as the tank should work satisfactorily for some time, but should trouble arise again I would suggest that proper man-holes be put in.\n\nAs this was an emergent case, I trust that these bills will meet with your approval.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nTHE W&T CHLORO-CLOCK\n\nWATER supplies at camps, on private estates, at institutions and where consumption is relatively small, are readily chlorinated with the W&T chloro-clock. Small swimming pools can be adequately sterilized with this equipment.\n\nThe chloro-clock is designed to accurately feed small quantities of prepared sterilizing solution. Such solutions are generally available and, where the daily water consumption does not justify the installation of larger types of chlorine gas control apparatus, are to be recommended.\n\nThe apparatus operates on the displacement principle, the control being obtained from a clock work mechanism which actuates an arm from which a displacing cylinder is suspended. The rate of solution feed is adjusted by means of a pendulum lever and is arranged so that the contents of the cylinder container can be discharged in varying quantities ranging from 30 hours to 8 days. A water supply under pressure feeds the small constant level box into which the solution drops. The same water supply also operates an injector which draws from the constant level box and applies the diluted sterilizing solution to the desired point of application.\n\nThe chloro-clock is started in operation by turning on the water supply and moving a lever which starts the clock mechanism in motion. Raising the weighted cylinder for filling the container jar automatically winds the clock mechanism.\n\nHeight: 67 in. Width: 12 in. Depth: 18 in.\nShipping Weight: 400 lbs.\nSpecifications\n\nThe equipment shall be a self-contained unit mounted on a cast-iron base and with suitable metal support. It shall be suitable for feeding a hypochlorite sterilizing solution of definite strength and shall operate on the displacement principle, the control being obtained from a clock-work mechanism which actuates an arm from which a displacing cylinder is suspended. The rate of feed of solution shall be adjustable by means of a pendulum lever so arranged that the contents of the cylinder container can be discharged at varying rates as required from 20 hours to 8 days.\n\nWhere the sterilizing solution must be applied against a positive pressure, the equipment shall be provided with an injector operated by an external water supply under pressure and drawing from a constant level float box so placed as to receive the sterilizing solution that flows from the cylinder container.\n\nAll parts of the equipment with which the chlorine sterilizing solution comes in contact shall be of materials resistant to the action of sterilizing solution. All parts of the clock-work mechanism shall be properly protected but easily accessible and so designed that raising the weighted displacement cylinder will automatically wind the clock mechanism.\n\nGuarantee: The apparatus shall be guaranteed against all inherent mechanical defects for a period of one year from date of shipment from factory.\n\nHeight: 67 inches. Floor Area: 16 inches by 18 inches.\n\nShipping Weight: 400 pounds.\n\nPartial List of W & T Chloro-Clock Installations\n\nWater Supplies\n\nCALIFORNIA\nAlhambra\nCOLORADO\nLafayette\nSilt\nDELAWARE\nBethany Beach\nILLINOIS\nCalumet\nINDIANA\nFrench Lick\nKANSAS\nErie\nMASSACHUSETTS\nCummington\nMINNESOTA\nMaple Plain\nMISSOURI\nMarcel\nNEW YORK\nSeneca\nNORTH CAROLINA\nHerkimer\nOHIO\nBrevard\nPENNSYLVANIA\nLowellville\nVIRGINIA\nErie\nFort Union\nHot Springs\nCANADA\nToronto\n\nSwimming Pools\n\nCALIFORNIA\nCulver City\nCONNECTICUT\nGreenwich\nILLINOIS\nChicago\nAntioch\nLake Forest\nKENTUCKY\nVersailles\nMAINE\nCumberland\nMICHIGAN\nDetroit\nNEW JERSEY\nBayonne\nNEW YORK\nOrange\nGlen Cove\nStewart Manor\nWISCONSIN\nMerrill\nOconomowoc\n\nPalomar Tennis Club\nG.

Authorities differ as to the amount of free chlorine that should be in a water to insure its freedom from microbes of disease, but in general we believe that 0.10 p.p.m. (parts per million) of free chlorine ten minutes after treatment will be sufficient. Obviously too much might cause tastes while too little would impair bacteriological efficiency. It is suggested in all cases that the State Department of Health be consulted concerning the desired amount of free chlorine. The importance of the free chlorine content of a water and the desirability of making quick and accurate tests, led to the development of the W & T Ortho-Tolidin Testing Outfit.\n\nWhen ortho-tolidin solution is introduced into a water containing free chlorine the water turns yellow or orange,\u2014the intensity of the color varying with the amount of free chlorine. The W & T Ortho-Tolidin Testing Outfit is a simple, scientifically calibrated device permitting the operator to match the color of the ortho-tolidin treated water against a known color standard and interpret the results in parts per million of free chlorine.\n\nPrice: $____ f.o.b. Newark, N. J. See illustration on last page.\nDESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT\n\nThe outfit consists of a two-tube color comparator with a small transparent gauging tube, calibrated both to measure ortho-tolidin solution and to indicate free chlorine in parts per million. One of the color comparator tubes has a colorless glass base while the other is fitted with a colored glass which corresponds to a value of 0.05 parts of chlorine per million.\n\nThe color comparator tubes are opaque, the interior walls being threaded. This construction eliminates the errors due to light refraction which are experienced when glass tubes are used and also overcomes difficulties in reading due to reflected light from the sides of the tubes.\n\nEach of the comparator tubes is fitted with a small valve at its base for lowering the level of the solution in the tube. This fundamental feature makes it possible, when comparing colors, to look through the same depth of liquid in both tubes and eliminates any error due to the natural color of the water being tested.\n\nFor convenience in carrying, a third tube is assembled with the comparator tubes and serves as a reservoir for the ortho-tolidin solution.\n\nDescriptive Operation of the W&T Ortho-Tolidin Testing Outfit\n\nFig. 1\u2014Have both comparator tubes \"A\" and \"B\" empty and clean. Hold testing outfit as shown and fill both comparator tubes within about one-half inch of the top with the water to be tested.\n\nNote.\u2014The sample may be taken at such a point in the distribution system that ten minutes has elapsed since the introduction of chlorine,\u2014or the sample may be taken nearer the point of treatment and stored sufficiently long to give the ten minute contact period desired before filling the comparator tubes. In cold weather this ten minute period should be extended to fifteen minutes.\n\nFig. 2\u2014Hold the transparent gauging pipette with the figures right side up, between the thumb and third finger, and the stopper from the ortho-tolidin reservoir between the thumb and the second finger. Insert the pipette in the ortho-tolidin reservoir. Place the forefinger securely over the top of the pipette,\u2014raise it out of the solution and by admitting air at the top by a slight releasing of the forefinger, drain solution from pipette back into the ortho-tolidin reservoir until the solution level in the pipette is opposite the red 1 c.c. mark. Introduce this 1 c.c. of ortho-tolidin solution into tube \"A\" (having the plain glass base).\n\nFig. 3\u2014Securely replace the stopper in the ortho-tolidin reservoir, cover the comparator tubes with the palm of the hand, and invert repeatedly to insure thorough mixing. Allow to stand until the maximum color develops, which requires from one to two minutes, before making the color comparison. (In cold weather this interval should be extended to five minutes).\n\nFig. 4\u2014The color of the solution in tube \"A\" (having the plain glass base) indicates the amount of free chlorine in the water. Lower the level of the solution in tube \"A\" by opening the valve at the bottom, until it approximately matches the color in tube \"B\", having the colored glass base). Now draw down the level of the solution in tube \"B\" until its level approximately equals that in tube \"A\". Now make a second adjustment of the level in tube \"A\" to match the color in tube \"B\". In comparing colors hold the comparator tubes over a white surface, such as a piece of paper.\n\nFig. 5\u2014With the colors matched insert the transparent gauging pipette in tube \"A\" with the figures right side up, until it touches the plain glass bottom. Place the forefinger securely over the top of the pipette,\u2014raise it up and read the calibration opposite the level of the liquid. This calibration indicates the free chlorine in parts per million.\n\nFig. 6\u2014Empty and thoroughly rinse both comparator tubes.\nAugust 17, 1931\n\nFile #128-1-5d\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn response to your letter of August 13.\n\nIn our quotation we have included in addition to the Chloro-clock extra equipment such as a booster pump, motor, a high pressure injector on the chloro-clock and an Ortho-tolidin Testing Outfit for determining the amount of residual chlorine in the water. The booster pump when operating will deliver 125 pound pressure to the injector to carry the sterilizing solution from the chlorinator to the discharge side of the pump.\n\nOn October 24, 1930, we had the pleasure of quoting Mr. W.G. Weddell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Manitoba, but due to the change in the price of our equipment it is necessary to increase our price slightly.\n\nWe are attaching hereto our proposal covering the furnishing and installing of one of our Chloro-clocks for treating the water at the Mackay Indian Residential School, all for the sum of $1831.50 f.o.b.

MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of September 15, which was sent to our Toronto Office, has been forwarded to us for an answer, as the Province of Manitoba comes under the Winnipeg Office.\n\nYou, no doubt, received our quotation dated August 17, on one W. & T. Chloroclock and extra equipment all for the sum of $1531.50 f.o.b. The Pas, Manitoba. This is our best price.\n\nWe were in hopes that it would be possible for you to install a new pump, whereby we could apply the chlorine at the suction side of the pump. After talking to the Fairbanks-Morse people, I find that it would be impossible to make such a change for the reason that there is already installed at the Indian School a Fairbanks-Morse Force Pump. If it were possible to apply the chlorine on the suction side of the pump the price could be cut considerably by eliminating the booster pump and motor.\n\nAs there is no other possible way of sterilizing this water, it will be absolutely necessary to have the booster pump and motor to force the chlorine solution into the discharge side of the pump.\n\nIf you require any further information, do not hesitate to write us.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH.C.

It is understood with the company that the Department is to furnish the services of a plumber to connect the water line from the pressure tank to the constant level box, and from this box to the pump and from the pump to the chlorinator, also tap the main supply pipe at the point of the application of the chlorine. It is further agreed that we are to furnish the constant level box, which can be purchased locally and also the services of a local electrician for the connection of the electric motor.\n\nPlease advise the Winnipeg office of the Company as soon as the apparatus has been delivered at the Pas, in order that their Engineer may proceed immediately after to supervise the installation as per agreement, and at the expense of the Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nNovember 9th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rev. A. Fraser, Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, requesting some lumber for repairing the hen house and the shute. Mr. Fraser's Residence also requires some shelves, and a door; altogether about $15.00 worth of lumber would carry out these repairs.\n\nShould this meet with your approval, I will be pleased to purchase this lumber and see that it is delivered and the work done.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst.

W. M. GRAHAM,\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER, REGINA, DATED NOV. 30, 1931.\nFile No. 205-11.\n\n---\n\nThe Clerk also says that new tables were installed last August, covered with battleship linoleum and cemented to the wood. He noticed that the linoleum is being pried off the boards, apparently with knives, and suggests that brass tape be put around the tables. Surely the Department did not allow them to put the linoleum on without binding of some kind. I am surprised that the Principal allowed the tables to be used before binding was put on. This should be attended to at once.\n\nApparently the school room is in bad shape. The plaster is giving way, and the interior requires a good coat of paint. This matter was reported to the Department a year ago, and I have inserted an item in the Estimates this year to cover same, but the work should have been done before.\n\nThe roof of the school is reported to be in poor shape. This should not be allowed to stand as a great deal of destruction can take place by delaying a repair of this kind.\n\nThe floor is reported to be bulged in several places. It is just possible that this may have been caused by the roof leaking. However, I am not sure of this.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV. A. FRASER, PRINCIPAL,\nMACKAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, THE PAS, MAN.,\nDATED NOV. 26, 1931.\n\nI appreciate this suggestion very much, as it has been most inconvenient for the teacher in this room. This we have brought to the notice of the Indian Agent, but no action was taken, as in many other instances. As this classroom is used daily, except Saturday, and even then has to serve as girls' playroom, which it really is, it will be most convenient to have a built-in cupboard.\n\nI would suggest that a carpenter be asked to do this piece of work, the approximate cost of which would not be over $50 for material and labour.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI would draw your attention to the following paragraph on Page 8 of Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools in The Pas Agency, which concerns the Mackay Indian Residential School:\n\n\"All doors leading to the fire escapes are locked. The Principal and Matron claim they can do nothing else as the children run away at every opportunity.\"\n\nI am of the opinion that this is a terrible thing. In the event of a fire taking place at this school, we would undoubtedly have a repetition of what has taken place in recent fires at schools in the north; there would be a panic, the children would pile up in front of the doors, and in all probability there would be a great loss of life.\n\nIn my opinion instructions by wire should be issued to the Principal to have the locks taken off these doors at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 5th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department wishes to refer to the question of fire escapes at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I understand that the doors are locked and that two members of the staff are appointed to each dormitory, with keys in their possession to open doors leading to fire escapes. This precaution is not sufficient and I have to authorize you or the Reverend Principal to have extra keys made for these fire escapes immediately. They should be placed in little boxes hung at each door and the front of the boxes to be made of glass, which can be broken in the event of fire. In addition to the members of the staff who are responsible for the dormitory and for the exits, there should be in each two beds closest to the fire escapes the most responsible pupils in the school, who will receive strict instructions as to what action they should take in the event of fire. In the case of the dormitories for small boys and small girls, at least one of the oldest and most reliable pupils should be in the dormitory and should sleep at the fire exit.\n\nFurther, regular fire drill should be held at various times during the day but particularly when the pupils are in the dormitories. The night watchman, of course, must be a thoroughly reliable man, who will constantly patrol the building during the night.\n\nI am sending an extra copy of this letter to the Reverend Principal for his information.\n\nYou may spend, approximately, $50.00 for material and labour in repairing the cupboards in the junior classroom at this school. You should, also, arrange to have metal binding on the edges of the linoleum on the dining room tables. Brass tape is quite suitable for this purpose. The materials needed should be purchased from indicated sources.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6268, file 580-5, part 5)\nM.

It is packed in ten gallon carboys, and the price is 60\u00a2 per gallon, F.O.B. Winnipeg, sales tax included. Carboys charged at $5.00 and returnable freight prepaid to Winnipeg, for credit at full value.\n\nThe MacKay Indian Res.

It is hoped that a credit for this carboy will be received in due course.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a further quantity of chlorine solution, it is noted that this can be obtained in ten gallon carboys from the Beaver Soap & Chemicals Ltd., Winnipeg, at a price of 60 cents per gallon F.O.B. Winnipeg. It is expected that the school authorities will keep an ample supply of this chemical on hand, and the cost of same should be paid by them from their per capita earnings or other receipts. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to see that the necessary chemicals are kept on hand for the proper sterilizing of the water at this school, and you should advise the Principal that it is expected he will arrange for the purchase and keeping of a stock of the necessary chemicals on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Wallace and Tiernan Ltd., and our Commission instructed me to ask your Department to kindly authorize this expenditure. It is estimated that 10 galls. would be sufficient for one year.\n\nIn a letter received from the Beaver Soap and Chemicals Ltd., they state that they manufacture this product which contains 10% available chlorine, and is packed in 10 gall. glass carboys, at the price of 60\u00a2 per gall. f.o.b. Winnipeg. They charge $10.00 extra for the carboys, but it is understood that this amount would be refunded when the carboys are returned. It seems to our Commission that this expenditure is a legitimate charge against your Department, and I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with the authorization requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nRev.

The rebuilt batteries have all essential elements new, that is new positive & negative plates, wood separators & acid. The glass jars do not deteriorate.\n\nWith the addition of the Principals residence, the load has increased since the present battery was installed, and it would be an advantage to install a larger battery.\n\nThe present generator is of sufficient capacity to take care of it.\n\nRegarding the switchboard, I may say that it is out of date, and I do not recommend spending any money on it.\n\nTo remodel it, replace the faulty instruments and install modern protective devices, it would cost as much as almost so, as a new board, and it would only be a crowded affair.\n\nA new board would not cost any more than $200.00 installed and would be value for money spent.\n\nIn considering these points, I have taken into account, economy, safety of operation, protection of batteries and the plant generally, and operation of the plant in such a manner as will ensure the long life of the batteries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

BUSKARD\n\nNew batteries and a new switch board are required for the electric lighting equipment at the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, Man. The local Indian Agent has forwarded a quotation from Charles W. Hill, The Pas, for the supplying of a battery of the required capacity, at a cost of $740, installed, and a new switch board at a cost of $200, installed. Would it be satisfactory to place the order with Mr. Charles W. Hill. If not, I shall be pleased to be advised from whom purchase of the new batteries and switch board should be made. I may add that the batteries at present in use were obtained in February, 1928, from the Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited, Winnipeg. Funds for the above can be provided from the Appropriation for Indian Education. This school is situated in the federal district of Nelson.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 26th, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nYour memorandum of the 8th instant, your File 128-1-5, refers to the purchase of new batteries and a switch board for the electric lighting equipment at the MacKay Indian Residential School at The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nIf the prices quoted by Mr. Charles W. Hill, of The Pas, are regarded as satisfactory the order may be placed with him.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School to be supplied with new batteries and switch board for the lighting system and enclosing a quotation from Charles W. Hill, of The Pas, for supplying same. In reply I have to say that you may place an order with Mr. Hill to supply a battery of 56 rebuilt cells, of a total capacity of 160 ampere hours, at the price quoted, viz.: $650, installed. It is to be understood that the batteries have all essential elements new, that is, new positive and negative plates, wood separators and acid. You may also arrange with Mr. Hill to supply a new switch board, at a cost not to exceed the sum of $200, installed.\n\nYou should see that all the above work is satisfactorily completed. Please forward a detailed account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the supplying of the batteries and the switch board. The installing of this equipment should receive early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nSamuel Levell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCol. Mermagen, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Commission, visited the Mackay School during the month of August, and in his report recommended that the Principal be instructed to take up with the Indian Agent the question of having the steel pole fire escapes which were removed some years ago, reinstalled. When these poles were removed, wooden stairways were built to take their place, and he describes these as being \"steep, flimsy and a positive menace\". Why the steel poles were removed, and the wooden stairways supplied to take their place, I am, at the moment, unable to determine, but the poles are still there, and as they could be installed without incurring any great expenditure, and the wooden stairways removed, our Commission recommend that you instruct your representative at The Pas to take the matter up with the Rev. Principal Fraser, and have this part of the school's fire protection system placed on a more satisfactory basis. A few years ago you authorized the installation of steel poles at our Lac la Ronge School, and these have proved very satisfactory at that institution. Our Commission believe that it would be a wise procedure to have the steel poles re-installed at the Mackay School.\n\nWhile writing about this matter I beg to state that the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Commission in his report referred to the need of a new barn, and of an ice house at this school, and our Commission sincerely hope that provision may be made in the departmental estimates for the fiscal year 1933-34 to build the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 4th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the fire escapes at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn November, 1929, the Department received a letter from the Assistant Deputy Minister of Public Works in Winnipeg, in which he stated that the MacKay Residential School had recently been visited by the Building Inspector of the town of The Pas. In commenting on the Building Inspector's report, the Assistant Deputy Minister's letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Reference is made to the brass rod fire escape system. This, as an efficient fire escape, went out of date in Manitoba long ago and the only fire escape we consider satisfactory is the stairway type or, better still, the metal chute.\"\n\nFollowing consideration of this report, the Indian Agent was instructed to install the stairway type of fire escape. I note from your recent letter that Col. Mermagen states that these are \"steep, flimsy and a positive menace\" and, in view of this report, the Department is writing to the Agent.\n\nThe need of a new barn and an ice house at the MacKay School has been noted but, at the present time, the Department is not in a position to state if funds will be available for their erection next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 4th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn official letter of May 22nd, 1930, you were authorized to have stair fire escapes erected at the MacKay Indian Residential School at a cost of $240.00. The Department presumed that these were satisfactorily erected.\n\nHowever, we are now in receipt of a letter from Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., in which he states that the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of their society recently visited the MacKay Residential School and his report reads, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"When the steel pole fire escapes were removed, wooden stairways were built to take their place.

It is noted that the engine at present in use is stated to be beyond repair.\n\nIn this connection I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department if Mr. Char. W. Hill, The Pas, could furnish a fair quotation for the supplying of the engine. Further, would not an engine of less horsepower be satisfactory. It is not considered that it would require a 4 H.P. engine to operate the saw. Please give your views regarding the horsepower of the engine, also if Mr. Hill could supply same and the approximate cost. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS.

W. Hill, of The Pas, Man., in favour of the Royal Bank of Canada, The Pas, and in reply I may say it has been filed in the Department and the provisions of the same will be observed.

Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe toilets, especially in the girls' dormitories, were very offensive and certainly have not been properly looked after. I pointed this out to both Mr. Fraser and the Matron, as there is no reason why these cannot be kept clean, and the ones in the dormitories should certainly receive special attention. The bath-tubs were also dirty and had not been looked after since last being in use.\n\n---\n\nThe fire escapes are all in good condition, and there is one fire extinguisher on each floor. I think it would be well if three new fire extinguishers were supplied, in order that there might be one in each wing of the building. The Principal complained about being unable to keep a water pressure sufficient to be of much use in case of fire, but I am inclined to think that sufficient pressure could be obtained if this matter was carefully looked after. The pressure tanks are new and there is no reason why they will not stand the required pressure.\nOttawa, October 18, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, who recently visited the MacKay Indian Residential School in September, last, reports as follows regarding the toilets:\n\n\"The toilets, especially in the girls' dormitories, were very offensive and certainly have not been properly looked after. I pointed this out to both Mr. Fraser and the Matron, as there is no reason why these cannot be kept clean, and the ones in the dormitories should certainly receive special attention. The bathtubs were also dirty and had not been looked after since last being in use.\"\n\nYou should draw this matter to the attention of the Principal. There does not appear any reason why these toilets and bathtubs cannot be kept in a clean and sanitary condition.\n\nThe Inspector states further that the boys were dressed in overalls and shirts, some of which were ragged and untidy. This matter should also be drawn to the attention of the Principal and he should arrange to see that this condition is remedied at the earliest possible date.\n\nFurther, the Inspector drew attention to the menu served the pupils. He states that, for the noon meal, no butter or lard is served, that the children receive only water to drink and that desserts are not served at this meal. He also reports that the supper meal appears rather light, in view of what the pupils receive for dinner. It is considered that the children should be given either milk or a hot drink - tea or cocoa - with the noon meal. You might report whether milk is served the pupils and the quantity used at the school each day. Milk is an important item of diet, especially for the younger children.\n\nAttention is drawn to the case of one of the pupils who had been placed in St. Anthony's Hospital to receive treatment for an infectious skin disease. The Inspector considered that this child could quite well have been cared for at the school and isolated in the hospital ward. Please inform the Principal\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nthat it is expected, in the case of minor illness, the pupils should receive treatment at the school and it is not necessary to incur the expenditure of having them sent to hospital.\n\nThe Inspector refers to a complaint of the Principal, that he is unable to keep a water pressure sufficient to be of much use in case of fire. The pressure tanks are new, and there is no reason why they will not stand the required pressure. The Principal should give this matter serious attention.\n\nI may add that the Department is taking up with the church authorities the matter of an improvement in the staff at this school. They are being requested especially to appoint a competent engineer-mechanic to look after the plant and machinery.\n\nThe Inspector has requested that a new hospital bed be provided. You may obtain prices from a firm on the list to receive consideration, for the supplying of a hospital bed and mattress, if same is required. If there are no firms at The Pas handling this equipment, you should secure prices from Simmons Limited and the Parkhill Bedding Company, both of Winnipeg. The prices should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nThe various matters referred to in this letter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

All the other toilets and bathtubs have been cleaned and are now in quite good order.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Hamilton's visit to this school it was the end of the quarter, and since then the pupils have received a new issue of clothes, and all looked well dressed at the time of my visit.\n\nI took up the menu question, and was assured the children would be served lard and cocoa at the noon meal. For breakfast, porridge with milk and sugar is served also milk with their cocoa. Milk is not served as a drink though 11 gals., per day, an average for the past ten months has been used at the school.\n\nRegarding water pressure in the case of fire, I took this matter up with the Principal, and had an actual test on the top floor of the school. The pumps were started and inside of three minutes we had a force of water 14 ft., high with 30 lbs of pressure registered on the tanks and another 16 lbs could have been supplied if necessary.\n\nMr. E.

You should arrange to have this work carried out as soon as possible. The Department will rely on you to see that this work is satisfactorily performed, and you should keep careful oversight of same. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the erection of slide pipe escapes.

The successful tenderer for this work was Mr. G. W. Hill.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, he assigned to this Bank the money due him under the contract and in addition, executed a Power of Attorney, authorizing the Receiver General to pay the money to this Bank. These two forms, the Assignment and the Power of Attorney were handed to the Indian Agent, The Pas, on October 1st and acknowledged by him on October 5th, stating that the forms had been sent to Ottawa. It turns out that the consideration for the contract, that is $850., was paid direct to Mr. Hill. The purpose of this communication is to ascertain whether the Indian Department will not recognize an Assignment of Money in a case of this kind or if so, we would like to know why the money was sent direct to Mr. Hill.\n\nYou will appreciate the fact that in the ordinary course of business we have to rely on these assignments and we would like an explanation for our future guidance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe The McKay Indian Boarding School Heating Boiler.\n\nI have inspected this boiler as per your request, with special reference to the Iron Arch & brickwork above the same.\nThe arch is down very low and the brickwork has fallen into the firehole. This has left the flue open direct to boiler end, at the front, i.e. above the firedoor.\nThe iron arch is very badly warped, and it is very doubtful whether or not it can be used again.\nIt is generally conceded the iron arch is a thing of the past, and I would respectfully suggest to you that it be dispensed with in favor of Plibrico Jointless Firebrick. This would replace the iron arch, also the brickwork above it.\nFor a return tubular boiler, this is the most logical thing to use.\nOne installed in a boiler of this class, it eliminates the necessity of taking down the outside brickwork to get the iron arch in. It can be economically repaired, as any burnt portion (say near the firebars at the side) can be cut out and a new portion dovetailed in.\nI attach hereto an estimate for this work, and await your further commands.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas. W. Hill\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nJanuary 5th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that the iron arch in the furnace of the MacKay Indian Residential School, The Pas, also the brick supports are falling away.\n\nThe iron arch is badly warped and may drop any day.\n\nI attach herewith a letter and quotation from Mr. C.W. Hill. Mr. Hill examined this furnace and I think his letter will explain what is wrong.\n\nI would suggest Mr. Hill be given this work, but that it be held off until spring unless the arch falls sooner.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS. Lovell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the condition of the iron arch in the furnace at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and enclosing a communication from Chas. W. Hill on the condition of the furnace and work required to be carried out, and furnishing his quotation for renewing the brick and iron arch and placing the furnace in a satisfactory condition.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, provided the repairs can be carried out in time to make payment before the end of the present fiscal year, the Department will approve of you arranging with Mr. Hill to do the work. We will have available certain funds this year to pay the cost. The repairs should consist of the work stated in the estimate submitted by Mr. Hill, at a cost not to exceed the sum of $145. I am returning Mr. Hill's quotation giving, in detail, the work he will perform for the above amount, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nAfter the repairs have been carried out to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. This account you should forward to the Department not later than March 15th, next, attaching thereto the quotation of Mr. Hill. If the work in carrying out these repairs cannot be completed in time to have the account forwarded by the date mentioned, no action is to be taken until you report the matter to the Department and receive further instructions, as it is doubtful if we will have funds during the next fiscal year to provide for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A. Fraser, Principal of the Mackay School:-\n\n\"Advised by Inspector Hamilton make offer of flour and feed direct Ottawa.\"\n\nPending the receipt of a complete inventory of the quantities still on hand in the Mackay School store-room, I can only say that on January 12th last, shipment was made by the Baker Oats Company of Saskatoon, of the amounts given on the enclosed invoice, and payment for the same was made by our Commission on Feb. 14th. Some of the supplies will have been consumed during the January-March Quarter, but in case your Department may be able to make use of what remains, our Commission will be satisfied to leave the question of quantities to be thus disposed of, in the hands of Mr. Fraser and Mr. Lovell as representing our Church and your Department respectively.\n\nAs steps must be taken in the immediate future to dispose of the supplies in question, I shall be obliged if you will give the matter the earliest attention possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.\nOttawa, April 6, 1933.\n\nRev.

Could not these supplies be forwarded by your Commission for use at some of the other Indian residential schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C.?\n\nI might add that the Department is giving consideration to the disposal of the equipment, stock, etc., remaining at the Mackay School and, in this connection, you will be advised at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I now enclose same.\n\nIf, in the final settlement with the Church, any cattle are retained, I would recommend that they be sent to Nelson House Reserve to meet those requested for that point in the 1933-34 Estimates. The Cedar Lake Indians would greatly appreciate assistance in obtaining stock and any number over that required at Nelson House could be sent there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMarch 31st, 1933.\n\nDr. H.G. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nAs instructed by Department wire of March 24th, I left for The Pas and carefully checked all property remaining at the MacKay Residential School. Attached will be found an inventory of all property.\n\nMr. Fraser the present man in charge is unable to say who the owner is in relation to some of the stock and also many of the implements. Undoubtedly all the small items were purchased through the Church Commission and consequently they are claimed by the church authorities.\n\nSome years ago the school was supplied with nine cows and these have increased to over thirty head, although in the meantime a number have been butchered. Of the original stock only three head remain, and the Principal intimated that is all the Dept., are entitled to. However one would imagine the nine head should be returned or replaced. These are matters, however, for the Dept., to decide. The same situation exists in relation to the horses.\n\nI checked over the machinery which passed through the fire and all that remains, which would perhaps be of use again is the boiler, two pressure tanks and a small water pump. The Principal and Engineer were both instructed to drain the boiler but this had not been done. Fortunately the water was still warm and apparently the boiler was not damaged. I had it drained to-day. The jacket heater had also been left and froze, destroying it for any further use. All laundry machinery and other equipment appears totally destroyed.\n\nThe electric light plant which includes the engine 10 H.P. generator, batteries and switch-board are in splendid condition. The two smaller engines are in fair running order. The above machinery and equipment could perhaps be used at some other school, and the batteries and switch-board should be packed and transferred as soon as possible.\n\nThe motor boat has been neglected and is in need of repairs. The engine is disconnected and stored in the warehouse, but I understand to be in good condition. This boat, according to the Principal, has not travelled 100 miles. I would recommend that the boat be repaired, the engine installed and that the same be kept as an Indian Department boat for the paying of Treaty and the shipping of supplies to Moose Lake, Cedar Lake and Chipewyan.\n\nIt is necessary each year to rent a boat for certain Treaty payments and this costs over \u00a3100. Further expense is incurred when rations are shipped. These expenses might well be eliminated by retaining this boat, which cost a large sum, and I doubt if we could even secure a bid for it, if put up for sale.\n\nCont'd on page 2\nThe horses number six with two colts raising three year old. Three of the horses I am informed were purchased by the Church Commission, the other three and the two colts I presume are Department stock. The three horses might be issued to the Indians at Loose Lake and Cedar Lake where they are very much in need of such assistance. These Indians often find it hard to secure enough hay, because they have no horses to work, and many are obliged to cut all their hay by the use of scythes. The team of colts would make splendid drivers for the Agency use. In the winter it is difficult to secure good horses and the livery bill for the Agent, Doctor and Nurse reaches quite a sum. Horses could also be used on The Pas Reserve in the summer and thus eliminate a large percentage of the taxi service livery charges for the Agent, Doctor and Nurse. I am sure average over $25.00 per month. No doubt some of the older harness belongs to the Department.\n\nThe democrat and sleighs could be used at the Agency, but the Principal claims the same is church property.\n\nThe wagons, harrows, disc, plows, sleighs, mower, rake, are old, and perhaps were supplied by the Department. They have done many years of service, and I think would render most value to the Department if issued to the Indians on the out lying Reserves. The equipment would help them in gathering and haying. I doubt if this machinery would be worth shipping south to outside points.\n\nThere is as noted by the inventory, other machinery, but I am informed it was purchased by the Church Commission. If such is not the case, I think it could well be disposed of in the manner suggested above.\n\nThe dining room suite and range in the Principal's residence is Department property. It has been in constant use but is in fair condition. The Principal expressed his desire to purchase both and this would perhaps be the best way to dispose of it. To place it with the second-hand dealer at The Pas would be the only alternative and would result in little return.\n\nI regret that a more definite understanding could not be arrived at in regard to the property, but as the large bulk of it was supplied before Mr. Fraser's time or my own, it was difficult to arrive at what property belonged to the Church and what actually could be termed Government property.\n\nThe following list of buildings remain:\n\n- Principal's Residence\n- Barn\n- Warehouse\n- Chicken House\n- Power House\n- Ice House (partly burned)\n\nAt the present time these buildings could not be disposed of and I doubt if any reliable party would wish to live there. Rev. Fraser requests that he be left in possession at least till the end of June, and this no doubt would be the best arrangement. After that it would be necessary to board up all windows and doors until such time same can be disposed of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, April 7, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the last instant, regarding the disposal of the flour and feed on hand at the MacKay Indian Residential School, I return herewith the account of the Quaker Oats Company giving the quantities of the various supplies purchased by your Commission for this school in January, last. It is considered that you may need this account for file in your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, April 7, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 31st ultimo and 4th instant, regarding the inventory which you forwarded of the property remaining on hand at the MacKay Indian Residential School after the building was destroyed by fire. The difficulty in deciding the ownership as between the Department and Church authorities has been noted.\n\nIn this connection it is considered that the authorities of the M.S.C.C. should appoint an officer - either the Rev. Mr. Fraser, the Principal, or another party - and that you or Mr. Agent Lovell should arrange with the person appointed by the Church authorities for a selection of the stock, equipment and supplies remaining on hand. If the Church authorities can use this equipment at some of the other residential schools conducted under their auspices, and will provide the cost of the transfer, they should be given the benefit of any doubt as to ownership. When their selection has been made, they should arrange as soon as possible to have the supplies distributed.\n\nRegarding the cows, it is considered that, as the Department some time ago supplied nine cows, although only three of the original number remain, the original number, viz., nine, should be transferred to this Department. The cows transferred to this Department should be sent to either the Nelson House Reserve or the Cedar Lake Indians, as decided by the Agent and yourself. The cost of transportation should be kept as low as possible.\n\nRegarding the horses, it is considered that at least three should be transferred to this Department. If this number are acquired, they should be issued to the Indians at Moose Lake and Cedar Lake. If the team of colts is turned over to the Department, they should be kept for use in connection with the work of the Agent,\n\nA. G.

The sorting out of the horses, and disposing of those turned over to this Department, will be left in the hands of the Agent and yourself.\n\nAny of the wagons, harrows, disc, plows, sleighs, and other farm machinery, acquired by the Department may be issued to the Indians on those reserves as decided by the Agent and yourself. However, if the Church authorities can use any of this equipment at their schools, they are to have the choice.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal wishes to purchase the dining-room suite and range in the principal's residence. Provided he offers a price considered fair, you may sell same to him, and forward the proceeds to the Department.\n\nThe Agent should arrange for the proper storage in one of the buildings at the school of the electric lighting equipment, gas engines, pressure pump, etc., as this equipment could later be shipped to one or other of our residential schools.\n\nRegarding the boiler, two pressure tanks, small water pump and jacket heater, the Agent and yourself should decide the action to be taken in preserving this equipment.\n\nThe Department will approve of the Rev. Mr. Fraser occupying the principal's residence until the end of June, next. He should be of assistance in disposing of the supplies, implements, stock, etc., on hand. The Department is anxious that all the equipment be disposed of and removed from the present premises as soon as possible, and will leave the matter in the hands of the Agent and yourself, acting in conjunction with the officer appointed by the Church authorities.\n\nYou will be advised later regarding the disposal of the motor boat and engine for same, which, it is noted, is dismantled and stored in the warehouse.\n\nAn accurate list should be kept and forwarded to the Department later as to the disposal of all equipment.\n\nPlease take this matter up with the Church authorities in Winnipeg and the Agent at The Pas at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Complete control of production assures uniformity in quality and gauge of wire. The copper content makes the steel rust resistant and because a hot galvanized coating is given the fabric after weaving, double resistance to rust is obtained. Hot galvanizing after weaving provides a heavy uniform zinc coating on all parts of the fabric including cut ends. The galvanizing will stand more than eight one-minute immersions in a copper sulphate solution as compared with the test for standard telegraph wire, which requires four one-minute immersions only. Edges of the fabric are supplied one barbed \"B\" and the other knuckled \"C\" or both edges knuckled.\nLINK FENCE construction as an engineer would\n\nPOSTS AND RAILS Posts and Rails which form the frame on which the fabric is stretched are made of full weight Stelco Scale Free Pipe, Hot Galvanized after cutting to length. Line posts, \"D\", spaced not more than 10 feet apart, are long enough to set not less than three feet in a concrete base. End, \"E\", gate \"F\", and corner posts are long enough to set not less than 3\u00bd feet in concrete and for fence 6 feet and over in height these posts are braced to nearest Line Post with Pipe Brace, \"G\", and securely held together by Tension Rod, \"H\", and Turnbuckle, \"J\". Attractive Ball Tops, \"K\", are provided when fence is erected without Barbed Wire Overhang. When Barbed Wire Overhang is specified the End and Corner Posts are supplied with galvanized malleable iron combined Ball Top and Barbed Wire Extension Arms, \"L\".\n\nFITTINGS All Line Post Tops, \"M\", Brace Rail Ends, \"N\", and Barbed Wire Extension Arms, \"O\", are malleable iron castings. Heavy construction Line Post Tops and Barbed Wire Extension Arms are clamped on the Posts with bolts and hold the Top Rail, \"P\", firmly to the Post. An ingenious method has been devised as part of the Barbed Wire Arm for holding the Barbed Wire. The wires are slipped into the slots and when drawn up taut the lugs prevent the wires from being removed.\n\nBrace Bands, \"Q\", and Tension Bands, \"R\", are made of Half Oval Steel Bars for appearance and to eliminate all edges on which moisture could accumulate. Tension Bar Retaining Bolts have common carriage bolt heads to prevent them from being loosened from the outside. Tension Bars, \"S\", which evenly distribute the stretching strain from the tension bands to the fabric are made of Round Edge Tire Steel using the largest cross-section which will fit through the mesh of the fabric.\n\nGATES All Gate Frames are made of full weight Stelco Scale Free Pipe, and when gate is over 4 feet in width a Centre Brace, \"T\", is also provided. Welded Corner Gates, \"U\", are electrically welded before galvanizing, the whole frame being hot galvanized after construction. Pressed Steel Corner Gates, \"V\", are made of Pipe galvanized after cutting to lengths required. The galvanized steel fittings are riveted together and to the pipe frame with brass rivets to prevent any possibility of rust. All gates are equipped with close set Galvanized Malleable Iron Hinges, \"W\", designed to allow the gate to swing back against the fence; a positive locking device with attachment for padlock, centre stop and keepers to hold gates when open.\n\nENGINEERING AND ERECTION SERVICE Our experience gained in designing, manufacturing and erecting fence is offered you to assist in solving your fencing problems. Crews of men, trained for careful planning and erection of fence, are maintained throughout the year at Hamilton and Montreal to assure the most efficient service. Should a customer prefer to do his own erection we will furnish all necessary instructions or if desired we will provide the services of a foreman and the equipment he requires at a very nominal charge.\n\nINFORMATION REQUIRED FOR ESTIMATING When writing for prices or ordering, draw a simple diagram showing lengths of fence lines; locations of gates, corners and ends; state whether single or double gates are required, give width of gate openings and direction gates are to swing. Also advise whether ground is level or graded and the character of the soil.\nCHAIN LINK FENCE CONSTRUCTIONS\n\nREACH FROM COAST TO COAST\n\nRoyal York Hotel - Toronto\nBridges Breweries Limited - Ottawa\nBell Telephone Company - Windsor, Ont.\nBritish American Oil Company - Edmonton, Alta., and Sand-\n    River, Ont.\nBrantford Hydro-Electric - Brantford, Ont.\nSt. Charles School - Ottawa\nSunshine Waterloo Co.

This service without obligation on your part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSALES PROMOTION DEPARTMENT.\nOttawa, April 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st ultimo, I have to say that you may arrange for the demolishing of the two cement chimneys which are still standing on the site of the Mackay Indian Residential School as, you state, they are a source of danger. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $15. I enclose an Encumbrance Certificate providing the funds required for this purpose, which amount should not be exceeded. After the work has been completed, please forward a certified voucher, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nThe Department recently received from Mr. Inspector Hamilton an inventory of the property remaining on hand at the school. It would appear that there is some difficulty in deciding the ownership as between the Department and the Church authorities. The Inspector has been requested to arrange with you and the officer appointed by the Church authorities for the disposition of the stock, equipment and supplies remaining on hand. The Department is anxious that all this equipment be disposed of and removed from the present premises as soon as possible. You will, no doubt, hear from Mr. Inspector Hamilton in due course.\n\nRegarding the buildings that remain, I have to say that Rev. Mr. Fraser has been granted permission to reside in the residence until the end of June, next. You should arrange to see that the lighting equipment and any other supplies which are not distributed are properly stored in the remaining buildings and that these buildings are securely fastened. You should visit same from time to time to see that there is no damage incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS.

In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the transfer of this motor boat to The Pas agency, to be placed in charge of the Agent, for agency use.\n\nIt is noted that this motor boat has been neglected, that it is in need of repairs and that the engine should be placed in good condition and installed. I would request that you have Mr. Lovell, Acting Indian Agent, furnish an estimate of the cost of the repairs required to the boat, the overhauling and installing of the engine. This estimate should be forwarded at an early date. Our funds this year are extremely limited and no request should be made for any unnecessary expenditure.

Agent Lovell and the Rev. Mr. Fraser, I have made a division of the property remaining at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and attached is a list showing the distribution of same.\n\nThe property retained by our Department was issued, as far as possible, to meet the requests set forth in the Estimates. The scales and gates are not needed at The Pas and no doubt at a later date can be transferred to some of our farming agencies.\n\nOne of Mr. Fraser's sons has kept the lighting plant in operation and the batteries up to the required charge. The Delco Light people state that these batteries, once having been charged, deteriorate quickly if neglected in this respect. The batteries and switchboard were supplied last fall at an approximate cost of $800.00, and I would not want anything to happen to them when no doubt there is some school or agency where they could be used. Mr. Lovell intimated that they might be sent to the Guy Residential School. However, as it was impossible, just at this period of the year, to get in communication with Father Doyon, the Principal, I am not in a position to say whether they are required or not. If the Department have no other place in mind where they wish the equipment to be sent, this matter could be considered as soon as communication opens up.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nThe Rev.\nThe Rev. Mr. Fraser has not yet submitted his offer in connection with the dining room suite and range, but as soon as it arrives I will forward same to the Department. It may be possible that he will be unable to raise the required cash, and if such should be the case I would recommend, when Mr. Fraser leaves the residence, that the above furniture be stored in the Agency warehouse until it can be disposed of.\n\nIt was impossible to move the cattle as the ice had not gone out of the river and yet was not safe to cross. As soon as the river opens, the cattle will be placed in charge of a white man who is willing to look after them for the milk during the summer. Next winter six head will be shipped to Nelson House. The other four head of cattle and a team of horses will be taken to Chemawawin (Cedar Lake) and Moose Lake as soon as the river opens up. The machinery has already been moved from the school premises.\n\nI experienced no difficulty in making the division of property and was assured by the Rev. Mr. Fraser and Dr. Westlake that they were entirely satisfied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nSir:\n\nIn my report of even date, regarding the disposition of property, MacKay Indian Residential School, I have mentioned the necessity of keeping the batteries charged and have pointed out, as informed by the Delco Light people, that these batteries should not be left for any length of time without re-charging. If the batteries are not to be transferred at once, I would like to be advised of the Department's wish in connection with this matter. Arrangements could perhaps be made to have the batteries charged once a week which would require the services of a man during the day at an approximate cost of $2.00; in addition to this, gasoline and oil would be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nWhile at The Pas, Howard Fraser, who has, during the past month, looked after the stock, engine room, and kept the batteries up to the proper charge, requested that he receive some pay for the work which he has been obliged to perform. I am not so much concerned about any of it except in relation to the lighting plant. This, undoubtedly, has been our property, and I think the Department will agree that it was to our advantage to have it properly looked after and kept charged. I am of the opinion that Mr. Fraser would be quite satisfied if he were to receive $1.00 or $1.25 per day. On the occasion of my first visit after the fire, I asked the Rev. Mr. Fraser to see that the lighting plant was properly cared for and the batteries kept in charge, and it is perhaps on the strength of this that Howard now presents his request for pay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMay 4, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the lighting plant at the MacKay Indian School, I would ask you to kindly arrange to have this plant stored until such time as it will be required at some other place.\n\nWith reference to the batteries would you kindly arrange with a competent electrician to have them fully charged and then dry stored by removing from the cells the electrolyte. If this procedure is followed it will be possible to store them indefinitely without deterioration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11 of the 28th ultimo, reporting on the equipment which remained on hand at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and enclosing a list showing the disposition of same. It is noted that no difficulty arose in making a division of this equipment. The arrangements for the care of the cattle until they can be forwarded next Winter to Norway House is approved.\n\nYou have been advised in a separate communication regarding the storing and care of the lighting plant. At the present time, the Department is not aware of any residential school requiring equipment of this nature. It is noted Mr. Agent Lovell has intimated that it be sent to the Guy Residential School. Should the Guy School require same, the Department might be favourably disposed to having it sent there.\n\nIf the Rev. Mr. Fraser does not purchase the dining-room suite and range, same could be stored in the agency warehouse after the Principal vacates the residence.\n\nRegarding the request that remuneration be made to Howard Fraser, who has been looking after the stock, engine room and keeping the batteries up to the proper charge, I have to say that the Department is not prepared to allow him payment for these services. It is considered that the oversight and care of the equipment, until it could be disposed of, should form part of the duties of the Principal and any members of the staff who remain, not only in the interests of the Department but also in the interests of the Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMr. McKenzie,\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie,\n\nI was speaking to Mr. Lovell, the Indian agent up here at the Pas Man today. He told me that the batteries were to be stored up here, also the acid solution emptied out of them.\n\nAnd I wish to ask you for the job of putting them in storage.\n\nI have my third class steam engineer certificate, also I have considerable amount of knowledge of storage batteries.\n\nAlso I asked Mr. Lovell about my wages for looking after the plant, and he told me that he had had no word about it.\n\nI have been looking after the plant ever since the 5th of March, and shall continue until they are stored away.\n\n(turn over)\nas far as I am concerned about my wages, I only want a fair reasonable wage,\nso sir, I hope that you will look after this for me, because I have done my best.\n\nWishing to remain yours sincerely,\n\nHoward Fraser\nMr McKenzie,\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Mr McKenzie,\n\nHaving been left in charge of the electric lighting plant, formerly of the Mackay School, The Pas, Man., by authority of Mr Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Affairs, for Manitoba.\n\nI have been looking after the engines & keeping the batteries in shape ever since the 25th day of March, 1933.\n\nI have no repairs for the engines and should they break-down, I have no authority to get new parts, and great harm would be done to the storage batteries.\n\nAlso I have not received any salary for this work, and I feel that I am entitled to receive some payment in return for my work, and I trust that you will look after this for me Sir.\n\nI shall give you some idea of the plant, which I am looking after, and the shape & conditions, which that I found the engines & batteries in, when I took charge of the plant, on the 25th of March, 1933.\n\nHoping that this will be of some use & help to you, As they are worth good money, & it will be too bad if they cannot be put to work elsewhere.\n\nOn the day that I took over the plant I found the following.\n\nthere was a 6 HP, Fairbanks Morse Gas engine to run the generator for the lighting plant, it had been taken off the water pump, because the batteries had to be charged, & the big IO HP, Fairbanks-Morse Semi-Desile engine was out of commission.\n\nWell this 6 HP gas engine gave a lot of trouble. It would run for half an hour time, then stop. So I had a look at it, & found that it was a little TRIP, which trips the magnetoe, of course it being broken, it would trip out of time, thus throwing the spark out of time, the only remedy, was to buy a new one.\n\nI asked the commission, & the Indian Dept office for a new part, but was told that neither party had the authority to get it.\n\nIn the meantime the storage batteries would become discharged, and they were only 6 months old.\n\nSo I immediately left the 6 hp, engine, and started to overhaul the big IO hp, engine.\n\nIt had just had a new cylinder head & new rings, & a new eccentric arm, put onto it.\n\nAs the engine was too stiff to start by hand, I had to take the little 5 hp, engine & make it drive the big one until the new parts were working smoothly enough to allow\nII\nto allow me to start it by hand. It took three days to do\nthis, the engine running 12 hrs each day,\nI also found the big engine out of time, so I adjusted\nit, and it has been working nicely ever since,\nof course the 10 hp engine could do with a new sleeve\n& a new feed pump, but the engine will run nicely without\nthose parts for awhile yet. If new nozzle-tips & head gaskets\nwere supplied,\nThere should be another ten years life to that engine.\n\nNow about the 6 hp, Fairbanks engine,\nIt has just had a new cylinder head, & new piston rings put\nonto it, and for just the cost of a new (magnetoe) trip,\na new intake valve-exhaust valve, cylinder head gasket,\n& a new spark plug,\nthis engine could be put into good running condition\nand it should be good for another five years or more,\nthere is also a new magnetoe on this engine that must\nhave been bought only a short time ago.\n\nNow the SAW engine,\nA 5 hp, Fairbanks-morse engine, I hear it was a new engine\nlast fall, but it is a very sad looking piece of machinery\nfor a new engine,\nI have overhauled it, The bearings are in fair condition,\n& so is the magnetoe, but the valves were badly burnt\nIt needs a new gasket & a sparkplug, Also it should have a\nnew set of piston rings, they should be ten-thousandths\noversize,\nI have ground the valves, but the engine needs a new\nhead gasket now, as the one I have on now lets water through\nto the cylinder casing, & piston rings, and it is doing great\nharm to cylinder casing, (scoring the cylinder casing)\nI have also tried to get a new one, but I am told there\nare no funds for it, but just the same the engine has to\npump water for the cattle & horse trough.\nI would be very glad if you could get a new one soon.\n\nNow the water pump.\nAll the bearings on it need rebabbitting & trueing up, also\nyou shall have to buy a new foot-pump cylinder casing, as\nit is about 90 ft, down in the ground, and it would be of too\nmuch expense to pull it up.\nand if you have another place to move it to, I think\nthat the rest of the pump would be worth the expense.\n\nNow we come to the storage batteries.\nI understand that they were new batteries last fall, well\nthey certainly do not look like it now.\nthey have a rich deposit from the positive plates on the\nbottom of the jars, which is over a \u00bc of an inch in depth\nand whenever the batteries begin to gas freely on charge,\nthis sediment starts moving, & settles over the plates\ncausing short circuit in each battery, and the only remedy\nis to take the element, positive negative plates, out of\nout of the containers, & wash them thoroughly, also the acid should be strained to keep the dirt out, then the jars washed out, and the batteries assembled, then the old acid put back into the jars, and new acid added to bring the specific gravity, of 1.250, (when I took over the batteries their specific gravity, averaged 1.160 to 1.165, but up to the present date I have only been able to reach a specific gravity of 1.210 to 1.215, and in their present condition, it is their full capacity.)\n\nNow when the batteries are all assembled, they should be given the rejuvenation treatment, then these batteries should be good for another five years service, providing they are given proper care.\n\nI think the main trouble with these batteries was that they were not charged often enough, by this I mean that more ampere hrs were taken out of the batteries in discharge than were put into them by charging.\n\nAnd should you move the batteries to another place, It would be advisable to give them their treatment at their destination, because batteries would be disturbed through transit, and also it gives the operator a better chance to watch & care for the batteries.\n\nThe Switch board, --- There is only one thing wrong with it, There is a graphite resistance connection, about 5 inches long and as thick as a lead pencil,\n\nI was informed that it was broken when they shipped the switch-board to The Mackay School,\n\nIt should be replaced, to enable the generator to give its best of service.\n\nThe Generator, --- It is in pretty dirty condition, and needs cleaning, also there is too much end play. It seems to me that a ball race is broken, but of course I am not sure what the fault is because as yet I have had no authority to overhaul it, but I knew that the end play should be taken out of it before it becomes damaged too much.\n\nAlso it needs new brushes, (carbon.)\n\nBelts,--- there is only one belt that is in good condition, It belongs to the lighting plant, The pump belt is in poor condition, as it is made up of short lengths, and is always breaking apart.\n\nNow Sir, I have covered all your machinery and I have tried to let you understand just what machinery you have up here, and their condition, and also the repairs that are needed that these engines might give satisfactory & economical service in future.\n\nAs I shall soon run out of fuel-oil, I wish you would allow me to get some, that I may keep the batteries up to their full capacity.\n\nYours Faithfully Howard L. Fraser\nOttawa, May 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 8th and 9th instant, regarding the services performed by you in looking after the engines and electric lighting equipment at the MacKay Indian Residential School, and requesting to be remunerated for your services.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that the oversight and care of the equipment on hand at the school after the fire destroyed the building, until such time as arrangements could be made to dispose of same, should form part of the duties of the Principal and any members of the staff who remained at the school, not only in the interests of the Department but also in the interests of the Church authorities. The Department has no funds to pay for work performed at the school. I would suggest that you refer the matter of remuneration for the work done by you to the authorities of the M.S.C.G.\n\nInstructions have been given regarding the care and storage of the batteries and for the storing of all equipment at this school until same can be disposed of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We would then suggest that the cells be disconnected at the terminals, the top of the cell cleaned and all moisture removed, and the battery be allowed to remain in this condition until such time as it is disposed of. This can be done in its present location quite satisfactorily providing once every month to six weeks the battery is given a small charge or boost. If no one is available at the battery's present location, I am satisfied a reasonable charge would be made by a local battery dealer to maintain the cells for say a period of one year in their present condition.\n\nWe believe removing the acid and disturbing the element is more harmful to the battery than the general wear and tear that takes place if the element remained in solution. In addition it is a costly process to remove the acid as well as replace it and bring the battery back to full charge.\n\nIn making the foregoing recommendation we are assuming that the Department will have use for this battery at some time within a year in some other location.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEXIDE BATTERIES OF CANADA, LIMITED,\n(Sgd) P.C. Armstrong\nManager, Winnipeg Branch.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter 128-1-5 dated May 4th, I wish to state that I immediately got in communication with the Acting Agent, Mr. Lovell, asking for a quotation on the work outlined therein. In his reply, he submitted a quotation of $77.00, and I am quite sure the Department had no intention of spending this amount of money.\n\nI then phoned the Manager of the Exide Batteries of Canada Limited, and enclosed is a copy of a letter I received from him. Acting on his advice, I sent the following night letter to Mr. Lovell:\n\n\"Quotation too high. Inspect batteries yourself. Add distilled water required, charge until each battery reads twelve twenty. Disconnect wires leading from building, also disconnect each battery from the other. Thoroughly dry all moisture on top of cells and leave same dry and shiny. Board up windows and lock door. Writing.\"\n\nI have not yet received a report from Mr. Lovell, but I have no doubt the work has been carried out, which will assure us of the safe condition of the batteries for at least two months.\n\nIf the Department are still of the opinion expressed in their letter of May 4th, and are prepared to incur\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nto incur an expenditure of $77.00, I will instruct Mr. Lovell to have the work carried out.\n\nI would again remind the Department of the possibility of these batteries being required at the Guy Residential School, and would like to know if it will be in order for me to take the matter up with the Principal, either through Mr. Lovell, the Acting Agent, or on the occasion of my next visit to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nMay 29, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th with further reference to the storage batteries from the MacKay School in store at The Pas, I would ask you to kindly arrange to have some competent person in the Pas keep the batteries fully charged for the present time. It is noted that they may be required for the Guy School, and I would be glad to hear from you as to whether they should be shipped to this Institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

At present I think a similar suite could be secured for around $125.00, and perhaps $45.00 for a range.

Lovell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJune 19th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nYour letter 123-113, of June 12th, has been brought to my attention with the request of The Pas Band that the Principal's residence at the MacKay School be moved to the nurses clinic building for hospital purposes. The Department's impression is that this would not be a wise thing to do. The Department has a considerable investment in St. Anthony's Hospital, which appears to be a thoroughly up-to-date institution. It is very doubtful if patients could be maintained in a small building at less expense than in the hospital, and the expense of fitting up the building would be very considerable.\n\nI am prepared to receive any further representations you wish to make in this matter, but at present can scarcely encourage the Band to think it can be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 128-1-5 dated June 2nd, I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Lovell, in which he states that Father Doyon, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, will no doubt be needing a new set of batteries before winter as the present set has been in constant use during the past six years, and recommends that the batteries and switchboard from the MacKay School be transferred.\n\nFather Doyon is also in need of a small gasoline engine, and I would recommend that the one formerly in use at the MacKay School be transferred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

We are, therefore, not aware what part, if any, of the electric light plant is on hand at The Pas. I would request that you inform the Department, as soon as possible, if any part of this electric light plant is stored at The Pas and its present condition.

It is considered, however, that it would not be of any use at the File Hills School, as it is a 125 volt generator, while the plant at the File Hills School is 32 volts.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn the comprehensive list of requirements for our Society's Schools for the fiscal year 1938-39, which I forwarded to you on the 15th inst., a new school on the Hudson Bay Railway was included. Shortly after I posted my letter to you I received the following information from the Rev. D.L. Greene, B.A., Rector of the Anglican Parish in The Pas, Manitoba:\n\n\"There is a magnificent outfit of buildings at Cormorant Lake\u2014property of the Air Base\u2014that are lying idle. The suggestion has been made by someone that they would make an excellent plant for an Indian School. Cormorant is at Mile 42, Hudson Bay Railway.\"\n\nI myself know nothing whatever about these buildings, and while the location appears to me to be too much to one side of the vast area to be served by the school required, I thought it well to forward the information to you for any action you may feel disposed to take in the matter. Should the buildings mentioned be made available for the use of your Department, and should you agree to their being adapted to Indian Residential School work under the management of our Society, I would gladly undertake to inspect them in company with any representative of your Department you might name, and furnish you with a report of their suitability for the purpose suggested. While I am of the opinion that these buildings, considering the purpose for which they were originally established, are not likely to prove suitable for a large and permanent Indian Residential School, I feel that there is a possibility they might be made to serve for a few years for a limited number of pupils, until funds are available to provide the permanent structure required.\nAs the need of a School for the Anglican Indian children in the vast area between the Pas and the Western shore of Hudson Bay, has been dealt with in my letter of the 15th inst., I need not deal further with it now, but our desire to give these children the benefits which such a School would provide has prompted me to furnish you with the information received about the buildings at Cormorant Lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Colonel Smart:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received by the Department from Dr. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that the MacKay Indian Residential School, conducted by the Department in cooperation with the Anglican Church, was totally destroyed by fire in March, 1933. This school was located close to The Pas, Manitoba, and was established to serve the Indian population of the northern districts of the province of Manitoba. The limited financial resources at the disposal of the Department do not enable us to erect a building to take the place of the one destroyed by fire.\n\nI am anxious to know if there are at Cormorant Lake buildings that are no longer occupied or in use and if such buildings would be available, should we decide to investigate their suitability for the purpose that Dr. Westgate suggests.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nColonel V.

R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, requesting the use of certain buildings at Cormorant Lake as an Indian school.\n\nThe buildings referred to belong to the Department of National Defence, and it is suggested that you communicate with that department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[V.T.

L. R. LaFleche, D.S.O.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of National Defence,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated 26th October with which you enclosed a communication, forwarded to you by Dr. Westgate, concerning the buildings remaining at Cormorant Lake, Manitoba.\n\nCormorant Lake is used each summer by Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft proceeding to the Northwest Territories and returning. This base is still required for refuelling and as an overnight stopping place for crews. A permanent caretaker is in residence in the mess building, and while we maintain a fuel cache at this point it is essential that he remain. Accommodation for the caretaker and the officers and airmen using the station and a storage building for fuel are essential.\n\nWith the exception of the mess building (used as the caretaker's residence all year round) all other buildings were constructed for summer use only.\n\nThis Department is desirous of assisting you as much as possible in this matter, and it is suggested that you have all buildings, with the exception of the mess building, viewed by a competent individual to ascertain if any would suit your purpose, and on receipt of further and more definite information from you it is hoped some satisfactory arrangement can be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(L.R. LaPleche)\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 29, 1937.\n\nRe: Buildings at Cormorant Lake\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of October 18th, in which you informed me that there were certain buildings at Cormorant Lake that might be temporarily used as a residential school for Indian pupils.\n\nI may state that the Department is in receipt of a letter from the Deputy Minister of National Defence, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Cormorant Lake is used each summer by Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft proceeding to the Northwest Territories and returning. This base is still required for refuelling and as an overnight stopping place for crews. A permanent caretaker is in residence in the mess building, and while we maintain a fuel cache at this point it is essential that he remain.

I am not at all sure, however that these buildings would be suitable for the purpose you have in mind. I have been wondering if it\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nwould be possible to have one of your Missionaries make an inspection of the buildings and let us have an additional report. If you do this, I shall be glad to go into the matter more fully when the report reaches the Department.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Buildings at Cormorant Lake, Man.\n\nImmediately after receiving your letter of November 29th last, #128-1-5 re the above-mentioned buildings, I arranged with the Rev. David L. Greene, B.A., Rector of Christ Church at the Pas, Man., to visit Cormorant Lake, and furnish the additional report you desired. His report reached me yesterday, and a copy of the same is enclosed herewith, accompanied by a sketch showing the relative location of the buildings.\n\nAs the Anglican Indians in the area between The Pas and the western shores of Hudson's Bay number 2,270 the need of Residential School facilities for their children is quite obvious, and while some of the buildings at Cormorant Lake might be utilized for this purpose for a limited period, and also for a limited pupilage, the need can only be adequately met by the erection of a school building with a capacity of 200 pupils, either at this or some other place along the Hudson Bay Railway, as soon as sufficient funds can be secured for this purpose.\n\nAs the need of this institution has been incorporated in the comprehensive list of requirements submitted by our Commission to your Department each year for a number of years past, I trust that some way may soon be found of meeting the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSec. Indian & Eskimo Res. Schools,\nCommission,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRe Airbase buildings at Cormorant Lake\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nIn compliance with your request I looked over these buildings on Monday and am favourably impressed with their possibilities for a temporary school at least. I have sketched a rough plan of the layout and will refer to the buildings in order as they appear from the left side of paper.\n\n1. This is a frame building approximately 22' x 42'. It was the men's sleeping quarters and the caretaker told me it had 17 beds. It is lined with gyproc and at present is occupied by the caretaker and his wife who say it is a very comfortable house.\n\n2. This is a large log construction. Logs are varnished and present a beautiful rustic appearance. It was the Officers Mess etc. The width is approximately 21'. There are two rooms each 33' long. The centre room was the main dining room. Then comes a 12' room which was officers' dining hall separated from the lounge or common room by an arch. The lounge is 19' long and has a nice fireplace. The kitchen 22' square opens into main dining room. It is well equipped with cupboards, etc. and still has a large range for cooking. Outside of kitchen is an ample refrigerator for use with ice. Over the front entrance is a commodious verandah.\n\n3. This is a frame building also lined with gyproc. It is 22' by 42' and divided into three rooms\u2014a large common room and two bedrooms 12 x 11. It was the Officer's quarters.\n\n4. This was the store room about 22' x 50. It is lined with gyproc and is divided as indicated in sketch. The flooring is not so good as the others being rough spruce. This building has been disposed of to the Bishop of Keewatin for removal to Gillam for a residence for the Missionary. I understand it is to be demolished for this purpose in the spring and shipped to Gillam.\n\n5. The radio house, a frame building about 30 feet square. The caretaker occupied this for a time and says he could re-occupy it if his present residence were required for school purposes.\n\n6. An old log store room about 18 x 20.\n\n7. The hangar, a magnificent oval roofed building about 95' x 80. Roof is supported by steel girders and floor is cement. This would make a wonderful indoor playground. There are tennis or badminton courts already marked out on it. All along each side are compartments formed by the supports for the girders that would make splendid places for work benches etc.\n\n8. The workshop with door leading from hangar. This is bright and airy room with high ceiling. It is about 32' x 48' and would make two admirable school rooms. Along the side of this room are the electric light engine room, furnace rooms, and coal bin. The dynamo has been removed but the whole plant is wired for lighting. The furnace is still there but the blower has been removed.\n\nThere are some smaller constructions such as oil houses, gas tanks, and\nThere is also a bath house equipped with showers (which I have used in days past.)\n\nGeneral: Since these buildings were erected by the Government, they are well built and being lined with gyproc are quite usable in winter. Of course I do not know what the Air Force would have to reserve for their re-fuelling service but there should be ample space left for a school of thirty-five or forty children in my opinion. The buildings are nicely situated on a high ridge overlooking the lake. I would say that the proposition warrants further looking into by yourself or some other member of the Commission and would suggest that the matter be followed up. If there are any questions you wish to ask me further I shall be pleased to try to answer. I would point out that the dimensions which I have given are not absolutely accurate for we did not go over it all with a rule, but they are approximately correct.\n\nTrusting that the information given may be of some use to you in considering the project, and wishing you all good things for 1938,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) David L.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nAs instructed in your letter of the 25th of April, No. 37371/1, and after the treaty payments were over, I took up the question of a site for the Le Pas Indian Boarding School with the Chief and Council of that band. I took them up to the Big Eddy part of the reserve, about four miles from the town, as we all agreed that the quantity of land required could not be had on the reserve any closer to Le Pas than that point. There are eleven houses starting on the high land there, nearest to Le Pas, spread along the ridge for about one half a mile, about seventy feet elevation above the river, and we started to look for a site, and I engaged three Indians to cut lines and dig pits about a quarter of a mile north of the last house. We ran a line for about a quarter of a mile straight east through thick bush, (I might say that all of this part of the reserve is what may be called thick bush), and found that after we had gone one hundred yards we struck dry muskeg with hard stony bottom, and this continued for all the distance we ran the line.\n\nI then went to Fisher Island, which is also completely covered with poplar bush, and went through it from south to north, about three quarters of a mile, without cutting a line, but had an Indian with a spade to dig small pits to enable us to judge the character of the soil. We found the soil so good that I decided to have two out across and the long way of the Island, so that I could have the levels taken and determine if it was high enough above the water for the purpose required. Mr. Stewart, a Civil Engineer, and myself took the levels, and we found on this Island everything required, good soil, high level, excellent drainage, a good lime stone quarry on the northwest quarter of about twenty five acres.\nand as good water can be had, in wells all over this country, north of the Saskatchewan river, we can feel assured of that most important consideration for a site for such a building. Mr Fischer after looking over all the reserve, came to the same conclusion that in this whole north country, it would be hard to find another spot of the same size as good. I had test pits put down every three hundred feet on the lines cut and the soil was uniformly good.\n\nI send you a tracing made by the Engineer showing the Island on a large scale, and also on a small scale, with the alternate eighty acres on the main land, and the levels of the island are also shown. There is a plateau on Fisher Island 2200 feet by 3400 feet, which lies from 20 to 28 feet above the present water level. You will notice by the profile a spot twenty feet above water level, and this is the proper location for the school, perfect drainage, as in 500 feet there is eighteen feet of a drop in the island, a great place for pits, if you wish to purify the sewage. Within one quarter of a mile of this site is situated the limestone quarry with enough good rubble stone to build all the buildings required.\n\nI also ran a line, from a point on the main line nearest the Island, east for about a quarter of a mile, and found that the land for about nine hundred yards is fairly good, then for 900 feet it is muskeg nearly to the bottom of the ridge. There is then a sudden rise of hill too steep for teams in the next 350 feet, or in all 2150 feet from the water to the ridge road. This line is just ninety yards north of the last house. All this high ridge is solid gravel fourteen feet deep to blue clay as shown by two wells at the Indian houses. There is from six to twelve inches of fair soil on the top of this gravel, and potatoes grow very well in a wet season, but are not a success in a dry one. This eighty acres alternate mentioned would be\na good site for the buildings, if nothing more was required, but in view of all the requirements I would strongly recommend the Island as the building site.\n\nI enclose you surrender of the Island, and attached thereto a resolution re the alternate eighty acres, passed unanimously by the band, which speaks for itself. I also send you my office copy of the reserve showing where we ran the lines, and would like same returned. If the Department decide to take the Island, it will be necessary at once to clear of bush say twenty acres, and I would suggest that while I am at Le Pas, I be authorized to get the Indians to clear this land. To connect this Island with the main land by a pile bridge sixteen feet wide will cost about $2500.00, three hundred and fifty feet with at present four feet of water. I got a rough estimate of cost from the Finger Lumber Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nAss't Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, acting under instructions given him in April, last, to select a site for the proposed new boarding school at The Pas, reports that after going into the question of a suitable site with the Chief and Councillors and a careful examination of the different places suggested by himself and Mr. Stewart, a Civil Engineer, he is satisfied that Fisher Island is admirably adapted for the school. It contains about 350 acres, good soil, high level, excellent drainage and a good limestone quarry of about 25 acres and good water can be had. Mr. Fischer, our Agent, came to the same conclusion. They also examined a suggested site on the Big Eddy part of the reserve, about four miles from the town, and came to the conclusion that the quantity of land required could not be had and that the soil was unsuitable. Mr. Jackson obtained a surrender of the Island site and attached thereto a resolution re. the alternate eighty acres, agreeing to exchange this site for an equal quantity of land on Fisher Island should the Department wish to place the school on the mainland.\nIn view of Mr. Jackson's report Fisher Island is the most suitable site for a boarding school and the Department would do well to accept the surrender and have it put through Council in the usual way.\n\nI may mention that there were no tenders received for the erection of the school at The Pas, which were called for sometime ago, and it is too late to do anything this fall, but the surrender could be accepted and tenders called for next spring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nWith regard to the site chosen by you for the proposed boarding school on the Pas reserve, I beg to say that I consider that portion of the reserve shown on the map as \"Fisher Island\" the most suitable location that could have been selected for the reason that the soil is first class, and the fact of it being an island fixes the boundaries so that there can be no dispute in this regard in the future; further it will be possible to have the buildings as well as the farm all together which otherwise would be impossible on any other portion of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nS.J.

The Inspector has obtained this consent in the form of a surrender, but as a surrender is not essential, a resolution being sufficient, the consent given may be taken as the consent of the Indians to the use of this portion of land on their reserve for school purposes, and submission of same to Council would not be necessary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn Charge Lands & Timber Branch.\nSir,\n\nOn the 16th inst., Bishop Newnham being in town, I took advantage of the occasion and gave him and the Anglican Clergyman here Rev. Mr. Fraser, a trip up to the site recommended by me for the location of the Indian Boarding, in my letter No 841 of date the 23rd ult. We spent a long afternoon in the viewing of the different possible positions on the reserve where 320 acres could be selected for the purpose of a boarding school.\n\nThe Bishop was very much pleased with Fisher Island, and said that he would have very much pleasure in agreeing with my recommendation as to that site, for the school.\n\nI have in view two parties who will clear 20 acres on the Island, and put into cordwood what timber is fit for that purpose, and I would recommend that instructions be sent me at an early date to have the work done.\n\nI would also recommend that authority be sent me to have a well put down on the clearing made, it will be required by the Contractor when building operations are on, but the main thing is, it will be a test, as to the water supply on the Island.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

A.\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the proposed site for the new boarding school on The Pas Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is glad to learn that you are pleased with the site selected by Mr. Inspector Jackson on Fisher Island, which is according to all reports received by the Department the most suitable location that could be chosen.\n\nWith regard to Your Lordship's suggestions that about twenty acres be cleared this fall and winter, that an examination be made of the limestone bed on the island and that a well be dug I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Jackson will be instructed to have these matters attended to as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

You may also engage a competent man to examine and report on the quality of the limestone on the island. If it is suitable for building purposes it would make a saving in the cost of material. The Department would like to have these matters attended to at your earliest convenience. The cutting and piling of the wood should be done by the Indians on the best possible terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J.

D. McLean,\n\nCharge to Dept. of I.A.\nWith further reference to your wire of the 11th instant, I am enclosing for your information three more interviews which I had today with the second oldest man of the Pas band first, then with a Non Treaty Indian who gave some valuable facts, and one interview with the oldest white settler in this vicinity, who has a wide knowledge of this country, having been a traveller in it for 35 years, doing business for the Hudson's Bay Co. for about 30 years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nGideon Halcrow J.P., late Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's Post at The Pas, is over 65 years of age and has been at and around the Pas for over 35 years, and remembers all the high water for that length of time. The highest water known was about 10 or 11 years ago, at that time before the flood Fisher Island was only separated from the main land by a very small creek. The flood of that year opened up quite a big channel, as the Saskatchewan River came over a low place in its banks about 2 miles west of the island and filled up the lakes and the pressure of water opened up this channel. I have known Fisher Island for all of these 35 years, and never knew of its being flooded and I would have known of it if such a thing had happened. When the Indians selected their reserve in the first place they took only high lands, and among them Fisher Island, what low lands they took were for hay lands, and Fisher Island has always been covered with wood, which shows it was picked for its elevation above the water and the quality of its land.\n\nCertified Correct,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nStephen Whitehead No 149 of the Pas Band is 70 yrs. of age, he lives on the opposite side of the river from The Pas. He has done a lot of hunting when he was a young man. He knows Fisher Island well, and has been there nearly every year since he was a boy, till the last 10 yrs. when he has not seen it so often. In the summer time he used to live on the island, and his Father before him and have their gardens there. He remembers the big flood of 11 years ago, and the island was not flooded at that or any other time. He remembers this Island for over 60 years, and it was always above the water very high.\n\n[Signature]\nFurther evidence as to liability of the flooding of Fisher Island during floods or in times of abnormal water. December 16th, 1912.\n\nJoseph McGillivray Sr., No. 104 of the Pas Band is 85 years old. He knows Fisher Island well; he has been up there since he was a boy 18 years of age, or every year for 67 years, and never knew or heard of this Island being flooded. He has seen 3 big floods about 28 years ago was the biggest flood he has ever seen, and the next biggest was about 10 or 11 years ago, and the only land up there not flooded was Fisher Island, and the Big Eddy. All of the country across from where he lived south and west was under water. He was living where The Pas Town now is at that time and it was not flooded.\n\nSimon Cook a Non Treaty Indian, lives up at the Big Eddy back of the reserve. He knows Fisher Island since he was a child, his Grandfather picked out the Island as high land to live on, and they lived on this place for over 30 years, and then they came back to the main land. At the time they were on the island they were Pagan Indians, but Chief Constant got them to join the English Church, and then they moved back on the main reserve. He says that ever since the world was made this island was dry land, except when Noah made the Ark, and all the world was flooded, he knows the site on the island where the school is going to be built, having seen the lines cleared within the last few days, and he says that the land there is good for farming. He remembers that there were a number of big floods but the biggest of all was the one about 27 years ago, at the time of this flood he had a house on the Island and lived there, the water came to the willows on the north west side of the island about 5 feet of a rise. When the flood was on, the island was as big as ever, you would not know the difference. They had a garden on the island for about 30 years, and grew the best of potatoes, corn, turnips, onions, and all the other smaller vegetables, they also ripened barley and wheat in their garden. There could not be found as good a place as this island, on the whole of the Pas Reserve.\nSir,\n\nYour wire of the 11th instant re Fisher Island being submerged, and abnormal floods, received and in reply.\n\nI secured Ralph Young an ex-pupil of one of the Boarding Schools, with his train of dogs and interviewed all of the older Indians, who were at home and available, and I enclose you the result of the interviews which speak for themselves.\n\nI may say shortly that if this Island is ever flooded the people of this town will have the water in their second stories.\n\nIf not already sent, send me the authority to let the contract for clearing the 20 acres as I had asked for tenders and they are in my hands now.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nChief Constant No.54 of the Pas Band is 75 years of age, he knows and has been at Fisher Island every year for about 65 yrs. He never knew this Island to be flooded, about 10 years ago when they had the biggest flood known to the oldest Indian and when the water came up nearly to his door, Fisher Island was high out of the water. The Chief's house is on a high bank on the opposite bank from the Pas Townsite, and the water came up to within 20 feet of his house, or about 3 feet below the level of his floor. At that time he was at the Fisher Island on a hunting trip, and it was away above the water level, high and dry. The water might have been up on the Island say 160 feet all round. He remembers all the high waters for over 60 years and the flood of ten years ago was the highest in all that time. The Pas Townsite, and where Finner's Mill is never flooded, and never was in all that time.\n\nJohn Young No.154 Pas Band is about 64 years of age, he knows Fisher Island well, he remembers the big flood about 10 years ago, he was at the Island the time of the flood and was up on it and it was high and dry above the water. He never knew of the water being up anywhere near the high part of the island. For over 40 years this island has always been away above all the floods, both his Father and himself were born at the Pas Reserve, and he would know if this island had ever been under the water.\n\nAdam Whitehead No.147 of the Pas Band is 70 years of age, he knows Fisher Island well. He was born here and has seen that island every year since he was a boy, and has gone up there every year visiting and hunting. The first time there was very high water 9 or 10 years ago, when the water went right around his house on the reserve right opposite the present Town, the island I am telling you about was not flooded at all.\n\nFred Ross No.125 Pas Band knows Fisher Island, he has been there nearly every year since he was a small boy, and he is...\nof The Town of THE PAS, MANITOBA\n\n...\nnow 74 years of age and he has never known of this island being flooded, it has never been under water since he can remember which is 60 years. Where he lives the water was all around his house, he lives opposite the Pas Town. In 60 years there has been only one big flood, and that was about 10 years ago in August, there is never much of a flood in the spring the water soon goes away, it is in the summer that we expect high water.\n\nJames Cook No 44 of the Pas Band is 70 years of age, he has lived at the Big Eddy, and Fisher Island ever since he was a very small boy, he knows the island well. They had a house on the island when he was a boy, and he lived there for years long before the first Treaty. His grandfather and father lived there and the island was never known to be flooded, if that island was flooded the whole of the Pas Town would be under water. The high water mark at the island is marked on the land and visible.\n\nSimon Bell No 191 the Pas band, is 55 years old, he has seen two big floods, when all the low land was flooded, and the Fisher island was never flooded, the water went up a little on the island but never was up to the high land. He remembers the island for over 40 years, and has been up there nearly every year.\n\nNorman Lathlin No 92 Councillor of the Pas band is about 60 years old, he knows Fisher island well, he has seen it every year as he was born here. I remember the big flood, I live halfway between the Pas and the Big Eddy, the water never flooded the Island and I have seen it ever since I was a boy about 50 years ago. The biggest flood I have ever seen was about 10 years ago, I was up at the island then and there was lots of high land on it. Where I live the water came up within 6 yards of the door and the land on the other side of the Saskatchewan River was all covered with water. Where the Indians live opposite Fisher Island has never been flooded for over 40 years and the Island is higher than where these people live.\n\nSamuel L\n\nIndian Affairs.

He never knew of this island being flooded, and I remember the big flood of ten years ago, the water came near my house, and the land across the river from where I live was flooded, he lives near the mouth of the Carrot River, the year of the flood I was at the Island, and it was away high above the flood, and for 55 years it is just the same.\n\nAlfred McGillivray No. 106 of the Pas Band, is 65 years old he was born at the Big Eddy, since he can remember when he was a little kid he never saw the Island known as Fisher Island in a flooded condition, he has seen it every year, and saw it the year of the big flood. He has seen 2 big floods in the past 40 years, and he has never seen the water anywhere near flooding the island, and he lives near it and always has seen it, he is only about a mile from the island, and it is in full view of his house. His Father also lived at the Big Eddy for a number of years, and he said I cannot find anyone who has seen that island flooded.\n\nDavid Cook No. 186 of the Pas Band Councillor, lives at the Big Eddy just opposite Fisher Island, he has been on the island ever since he was a small boy and never knew about any water getting anywhere near over it. If that island is ever flooded the whole of The Pas town, and lower part of the reserve will be covered with water several feet deep. He has seen only one big flood, it was about 10 years ago and the island was not anywhere near being flooded. The drift wood and big logs he showed me last August when we were picking the site for the new Indian Boarding School, were put there by the big flood and have never moved from there since. Before the Treaty some halfbreeds were on the island, had houses and gardens, and were never flooded out but were moved off when the treaty was made, and it became part of the Pas Reserve.\nCharles Cook No.190 of the Pas band age 45 lives just across the lake from the Fisher Island about One \u00bd mile away, and it is in full view of his house. There are six Indians living just at this point, and he speaks for all of them; their names are Charles Partridge age 34, No.283, Jacob Lathlin age 44, No.212, John Harris age 65, No.73, Pierre Highway age 35, No.208, and Joseph Webb age about 60, No.78, all of the Pas Band. They all remember the biggest flood known to the oldest inhabitant of the Pas reserve, which was about 10 years ago, the water at that time was just five feet higher than it was last August when we picked the Island as the site for the Boarding School. He showed us on the bank of the lake the marks of the two waters, and we had the difference measured by David Cook Councillor, and he made it just 5 feet. He was at Fisher island often the year of the high water, and you would not notice any difference to amount to anything in the island, he has lived there opposite the island all his life.\n\nJames Lathlin No.69 of the Pas Band is 65 years of age, he has lived at the Pas reserve for all his lifetime, and has been living a way up to the Big Eddy for the last seven years. He knows Fisher island, has been there lots of times and never heard of its being flooded, he has seen the highest water mark on the island, it is about 100 feet in from the ordinary high water mark which they get each year usually in July or August. He remembers the big flood about 10 years ago, and the island was not flooded at that time and never has been to my knowledge, and I would know if such a thing had happened, as we had gardens on the island at one time and they were never destroyed.\n\nBen McGillivary No.105 of the Pas Band is 70 years old, he knows Fisher Island, it never was known to be flooded, and his old people told him that it was never flooded. He remembers the big flood and knows that the island was not flooded at that time, he lives near the Big Eddy and would know of such a thing. He can see island from front of his house, about a mile away.\nJonah Dignall No 172 of the Pas Band is 55 years of age he knows Fisher island and never knew or heard of its being under water. If that island was ever under water the whole of this country would be under water. He remembers the big flood the one about 10 years ago, he was up at the island the time of the flood and it was high and dry.\n\nPatrick Constant (son of the Chief) No 232 of the Pas Band and one of the Councillors of the band is 45 years old. He says I know Fisher Island near the Big Eddy, this island is not on the banks of the Saskatchewan River but lays about half a mile away between two lakes, and is not subject to flood the same as if it lay on the banks of the river, the water that comes there during flood has a large area to scatter over. He remembers the big flood he was up near the island that year when the flood was on and it was not flooded. He knows the Island since he was a boy and he never knew or heard of its being flooded.\n\nRalph Young son of William Young No 235 of the Pas Band, and himself now a member of the band was Interpreter for the Inspector during the whole of Friday the 13th day of December while he was making an investigation for the Department re wire of the 11th of December. All the members of the band interviewed were certain of what they claim is a fact that Fisher Island was never near being overflowed, and they all laughed at the idea of this Island ever being under water.\n\nCertified Correct,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing statements of interviews had by you with some of the older Indians and white settlers in the vicinity of The Pas in regard to the Fisher Island site for the proposed boarding school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there would appear to be no doubt that it will be quite safe to build on this site.

No stumps of trees or brush to be left higher than six (6) inches above the level of the ground.\n\nALL the trees on the said 20 acres are to be cut into four foot cordwood, and left in piles where most convenient for the party of the second part, and for the use of The Party of the First Part.\n\nNO pile shall contain less than one cord of wood, and further it is understood and agreed that no timber suitable for firewood is to be burned.\n\nThe work above mentioned is to be completed and finished by the Second day of March, 1913.\n\nAs the work progresses the party of the first part shall pay to the party of the second part, the sum of twenty five dollars, on the completion of the work on each acre, and the balance, being the sum of $250.00 will be paid upon the completion of the work, and the passing of the job by the party of the first part.\nAND it is hereby laid down and understood, that the party of the First Part, shall be the final judge as to the work being done as this Contract calls for.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals on the Day and Year above written.\n\nSigned, Sealed, and Delivered,\n\nIn the Presence of\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Lock\n\nMark\nOttawa, January 10, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department is sending you, under separate cover, an accountable cheque for $500.00 to be used in paying advances to Mr. David Cook, who has the contract for clearing the site of the new Pas Boarding School.

It will be necessary to have a second well at or near the stables, and I would recommend that I be given authority to put down the two wells as the second will be small compared with the first owing to the fact that we will be bringing in a well boring outfit from Melfort, and the more wells put down the cheaper we can get them. The conditions at the Island are just the same as in the Stonewall district, there we bore a six inch hole to the rock put in piping from the ground to rock, anywhere from 6 to 25 feet, and then bore a five inch hole in the rock till we find a good supply of water, always under a hundred feet.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Diocese of Saskatchewan\n\nBishop Thorpe\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\nApril 7th, 1914\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThere are still one or two matters I wish to bring before you re. the Pas Boarding School.\n\nFor the greater economy of the management of the School, & that is, for the benefit of the I.D., certain things should be done now or during the summer to prepare for occupation. The people at the school, whether pupils or staff, will want fuel & food from the start, the cost of which may be much lessened by forethought. (1) 400 cords of wood should be cut & piled from the school property, & 1/2 an acre would be broken up into little plots for potatoes. As to (1), I reminded the I.D. of this a year ago, & suggested that as the ground is cleared for building the wood should be piled, etc. I approved the suggestion\u2014thought. But I am informed that those who cleared the land were allowed to pile & cut the timber\u2014a shocking waste. But the fuel will be needed, & should be ready, & the ground has been cleared\u2014I can undertake to start with this big initial expenditure.\n\n(2) This also is necessary & will fit in with (1).\n\nI would ask the I.D. to advance $1,000 ($500 expended on fuel preparation & 1/2 potato-planting; as much as possible, but not more than $1,000) as a grant, the balance to be an advance. We need...\n\nVERRY POOR COPY\nby degrees, by the School in the first year or two. The Church in Saskatchewan has no money to advance in this purpose, so it seems wise to be fairly referable to the S.D. We are then prepared to get the work done. I have appointed a young man to that mission for the summer whose services should enable him to look after the potato planting & cultivation. I am trying to get tenders for (a) cutting & picking in cords 400 cords of wood & (b) breaking 5 acres for potatoes. I hope you will be able to meet me in this matter, as it will simplify matters. There is no time to lose if this is to be done.\n\nThe well-water is very hard, the river water is hard, & boiling it means much labour. There will be a great body of rain-water from the roof of all that building which should be saved. I hear there is not tank built in. There should be a tank or cistern, holding 6,000 gallons, cement or galvanized iron such a position in basement as is safe from frost, connected with eaves-troughs from all the roofs, & with a pump in the kitchen, or in the upper floor. I hope these things also done.\n\nI don't know the plans in full, but there should be a Principal's residence, & stable & wood shed, &c., &c. I commend this all to your consideration & favour, &c.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours Truly\n\nJ.H. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, April 14th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the contract made with Mr. David Cook, for the clearing of the site for the Pas Boarding School, it was provided that, \"All the trees on the said 20 acres are to be cut into four foot cordwood, and left in piles where most convenient for the party of the second part, (David Cook), and for the use of the party of the First part, (The Department of Indian Affairs). All the trees and brush on the said 20 acres to be cut down, all the brush and tops and limbs of the trees to be put in piles and burned.\"\n\nThe Department has recently heard from a reliable source that all the cordwood as well as the brush etc. has been burned.\n\nKindly inform the Department at your earliest convenience whether this report is true, and if so, forward the name of the party or parties who burned this wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nApril 14th, 1914.\n\nDear Bishop Neenham -\n\nI received this morning your letter of the 7th instant in reference to the Pas Boarding School and have given it consideration. I am surprised to learn about the destruction of the wood as it was distinctly provided for in the contract that all wood suitable for fuel should be piled separately and our object in doing this was that the school should have a supply available when ready. I am today writing to the Indian Agent and asking him for a report. In view of the circumstances I am prepared to offer a grant not exceeding $1,000.00 for the purchase of fuel and for the clearing of a portion of the land for gardening purposes. When Your Lordship receives the tenders, if they are reasonable, you may accept them upon this understanding, and vouchers with the tenders attached can be submitted to the Department for payment in due course.\n\nIn connection with the boilers in the school our attention has been drawn to the quality of the water and arrangements are being made for the installation of a cistern.\n\nProvision is made in the main building for a residence for the teacher and we shall provide some outbuildings in the way of a stable, wood-shed, etc.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Neenham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nReferring to Department letter No. 373371-1 dated 14th, inst., I beg to say that I was about to report the burning of the wood mentioned on Fisher Island which was cut and piled on the 20 acres cleared. I was only recently aware that this wood was used, upon my visit with Dr. Orok to see the hospital building there.\n\nThe wood was burnt by the contractors building the school, Snyder Bros. I do not know how many cords were used. Some of it I know, was accidently burned when David Cook was burning the underbrush last summer. The brush was burned when the Indians were clearing the site.\n\nMr. Turner will know how much wood was taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa April 30th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd, inst., with reference to the burning of the wood, which was cut on the site of the Pas Boarding School.\n\nThe Department wishes you to investigate this matter and to find out definitely how much wood was burned by Snyder Bros.\n\nKindly advise the Department with regard to this as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His Lordship Bishop Newham is calling for tenders for the wood and he has been informed that he may accept any reasonable tender or tenders that he receives; he is also being asked to have the accounts forwarded to the Department through you.\n\nI am enclosing herewith the first account received for seed potatoes, which you will be good enough to attach to a voucher and certify to in the usual way and return to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nReplying to Department letter No. 373371-1 dated April 30th, 1914, regarding wood used by Snyder Bros. on Fisher Island, I would say that after interviewing Mr. Spyder, who is in charge of the work, he assures me they used about 12 cords. I think this is right, as I know when David Cook was burning the underbrush, on the clearing, the fire got away from him, and a large quantity of the wood was burnt then.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, June 11, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant I have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department know the value of the twelve cords of wood burned by Snyder Bros., the contractors for the Pas Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nReplying to Department letter No. 373371/1 dated 11th inst., I beg to say that the wood used by Snyder Brothers, is worth $1.50 per cord. This is the usual price paid for wood in the woods where it is cut; and as this wood was taken from where it was cut, I would judge the value to be the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, July 15, 1914.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that some of the wood which was cut and piled on Fishermans Island on the twenty acres of land which were cleared for the site of the Pas Boarding School has been used by your firm. The Department made inquiry as to the quantity and value of the wood so used and is now in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Taylor, who states that there were about twelve cords used, which are valued at $1.50 per cord or $18.00 altogether.\n\nI should be glad if you would forward a cheque for this amount, as it would not be well to complicate matters by charging you with this sum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

April 1st, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI desire to call the attention of the Department to the fact that it is very important that the pile bridge to connect Fisher Island with the Main Reserve at a point near the Big Eddy of the Saskatchewan River, should be built at as early a date as possible. When my report was sent in on the School Site, the necessity for this bridge was mentioned, and a rough estimate of the cost given at $2,000.00. This estimate was arrived at by consulting the Finger Lumber Company, as to the cost of piles and lumber, and practical men in The Pas, as to cost of labor in putting up the bridge.\n\nYour Mr. Ogilvie informed me last fall that the cost of the bridge was in the estimates for the coming year.\n\nAs no doubt the Department are aware that at The Pas where the Saskatchewan River is bridged, that bridge has on both sides a place for ordinary vehicle traffic, though the approaches are not yet in.\n\nAt a meeting of The Pas Band, it was carried unanimously that the Band would clear a 66 foot road through the Reserve about four miles, if the Department would furnish provisions and grade and gravel same.\n\nThere is a number one road for six or seven miles on the Big Eddy Ridge, fit for automobiles now, and if these four miles were fixed, you can see what a boon it would be to The Pas Town (where for years there will be no other road) as well as to the Indians, and remove the objection that some of the\npeople there have to the site of the Indian School.\n\nIf you will grant permission, I will undertake the putting in of this road, after the Treaty Payments in July.\n\nIf you could spare Mr. Ogilvie for a trip to see the situation of this road, I feel sure you would allow the building, and it will only cost, say, $2500.00 with the Indians working as they have promised.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nP.S. I am attaching a rough plan showing where the road to be built is situated.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRe. my letter No. 1485 of date the 1st of April 1915. I will be in The Pas on July 5th and will likely have a Band Meeting shortly after that date. The Indians no doubt will desire to know about the road and bridge to Fisher Island.\n\nPlease address letter in reply to The Pas, up to the 24th of July.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nD.

Gravel alone will not answer the purpose, and is destructive to floors.\n\nThe cement sidewalks will prove an economy in the long run, as they will save the floors and clothes, and will be conducive to health.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours Obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept/ of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTUDHOPE, ANDERSON CO., Limited\n\nWinnipeg, Man., 10th May 1915\n\nShipped from Winnipeg\n\nSold to Dept Indian Affairs.\nPer S J Jackson Stonewall Man.\n\nRev Louis Laronde AT The Pas Man.\n\nSHIPPED TO 8516 ORDER NO.\nLEDGER FOLIO INVOICE NO.\nCHECKED BY\n\nTERMS Cash 30Dys\n\n1 Big Stump Puller W/ 6 Ft Anchor & 75 Ft Pullrope\n\nMATERIAL SUPPLIED\nWORK PERFORMED\n\nCharges fair and just.\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am writing the \"McKay Boarding School.\" I wish you or some one from Ottawa interested in the Indians could be here between now & September to see the progress, almost wonderful, in the garden & surroundings. A large clearing, constantly growing, stumping & clearing up, growing a lovely fine potato & vegetable garden. It has meant much work & care, & the doing it has been a good training lesson to the boys. Everything seems in good order, & I think Mr. Laronde is showing good capacity.\n\nNow, I wish to mention three things requiring the consideration & action of the J.S.C.\n\n1. The no. of pupils authorized for Capitation grant should be increased from 50 to 100. Support last year is strongly in favor of it, & has privately written. At present there are 47 boys in the two dormitories, but each dormitory could take 26 & 23 beds without undue crowding, say 53 or 50 boys in all.\n\nThere are now 35 girls in their two dormitories, & these could be likewise increased to 53 or 55.\n\nThere are many applications now hope to facilitate\nfrom Red Earth, Moore Lake, Cumberland, etc.\n\nSpeak of Miss from the Pass River, etc.\n\nThe staff also is large enough in this mission so that the school would pay better returns in the larger number. Discipline, health, conduct, are good, so I hope the S.D. will sanction the increase.\n\nI believe Inspector Jackson asked for a supplementary grant of $250 toward the expense of clearing. I do not think he has yet heard the reply of the S.D. I most earnestly back his request. The clearing is very difficult a costly work. The amount of stumps & rocks not only makes the work hard, but also uses up a great number of tools. The work already done is marvelous. The Church in Saskatchewan is already in difficulties with the Bank & can not possibly grant a dollar towards this work, which belongs rather to the S.D. than to the Church.\n\nA farm is entirely new land, a plant such a work, can not hope to reap any profit in two years. It is all expenditure at first. But I can confidently prophesy that in that time this farm will be paying its way & partly supporting the school.\n\nI wish to speak in good time for a possible further request presently for financial help. It may not come again, but it may do so, if you may\nWe wait for the actual request, but may rely\n\nafter all my information. The Saskatchewan river has been high this land flooded as has not happened for years. Mr. Lariviere got to work early in anticipation a began cutting hay in the usual hay-grounds. He cut a great deal in three different places; but the flood rose rapidly, covered all of them, washing away all the cut grass. He only saved 5 or 6 loads, with every possible effort, where he had to haul while green, and dry them here. There is now no possible hay-cutting all around the place. The nearest he can get is up the Carrot River, some 40 miles away, so he is sending up the first load of workers' horses & machinery today. His men are hiring a steam-boat & barge to carry them up, & bring them down when all is cut. He will then haul the hay in winter, though he may have to fetch home some of it before that, when his hay runs out.\n\nThis will mean great expense for a young and half-green school-farm, & will cripple us greatly unless you help us\u2014\n\nCommending all these matters to your interest\n\nI remain\n\nyour faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Maclean\n\nDistrict of Saskatchewan\n4th August, 1915.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham,\n\nI have your communication of the 29th ultimo in reference to the Pas school. I regret that no increase can be made in the pupilage this year, but I shall be pleased to bear this school in mind for an increase next fiscal year. I shall look further into the question of assistance to help clearing some of the land in connection with the school.\n\nI note the regrettable circumstances in connection with the hay crop. I doubt if we will have funds which will be available for this purpose. If you find it necessary to do so you might submit a statement showing the expenditure for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Right Rev. J.A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to that portion of Bishop Newnham's letter of the 29th ultimo in which he asks that a grant be made to assist in clearing of stumps and brush the twenty-five acres of land which was cut over sometime ago so that it might be ready for cultivation, I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Jackson estimated that it would cost at least $250.00 in addition to the boy's labour to get this land into condition to crop.\n\nAs the school will depend to a large extent on what can be raised on the soil to help out the finances I would recommend that, if money can be found, a grant of $250.00 for this purpose be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

L. Laronde, Principal\nof The Mackay School, The Pas.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that it will be to the best interests of the school, to divide the amount of land the department would be willing to grant into two lots; that instead of one hay-reserve to set aside two for the school, one close at hand on the Saskatchewan and the other as a last resort, further away on the Carrot River. I have ventured to mark the suggested hay-lands on the map you sent me, marked hay-reserve Nos. 1 & 2.\n\nHay Reserve No. 1 would be seven miles up the Saskatchewan from the school, and would be at a convenient distance from the school, as compared with Hay-reserve No. 2 on the Carrot River which is about thirty miles from the School. A well defined ridge runs at right angles to the River and another ridge runs parallel for quite a distance. A line drawn East and West from a point half a mile from the North end of Big Island would mark the South boundary.\n\nAn interval of about three weeks elapses between the word of a flood at Edmonton and its arrival on the School Reserve, and there is a further interval of over two weeks before particular hay-field marked Hay-Reserve No. 1 is flooded; as the fields are flooded not by the overflow of the banks of the river but by the coming up of the water from the rear. In this way the month of July, by ignoring our own flats, and going to this hay-field on receipt of word of a flood, we could get hay and have it all stacked on the River-bank in good time.\n\nHay Reserve No. 2 would be located on the Carrot River, on Twenty-three miles from The Pas, on the West side of the river, about a mile above the Creek named Waskwei on the Map. We would be about a mile above Waskwei on the South bank, and our hay-field is further up on the North bank. This hay-field is very good, and it's only drawback is its distance from the school, but it should be dependable.\n\nEXTRACT FROM ditto FOR DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT\n\nGENERAL.\n\nTo insure the successful harvest of our hay in case of floods, we would require a scow for the transport of our hay, as with it we could be independent of transportation and not be depended upon in emergencies. The Department ought to provide us with a barge for freighting purposes, suitable for carrying horses.\n\nIf granted us the necessary lumber for a scow, we could say it would be justified, not only by the expense of the hay, but also in vexatious delays.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to thank you for your last letter re. Onion Lake School. I am not yet satisfied with the decision of the I.D. as to our school buildings there and the land on which they stand. But I will look into that matter before I write further. I am writing now about the hay-reserve requested for the McKay Boarding School.\n\nThe Pas. I find that the letter to me on this subject was written from Mr. McLean, your Assistant Deputy. It was headed 375371/1, dated Feb. 14th. But as I have begun this letter to you I will so continue it. It would probably have to come to you in any case. In reply to that letter then, I am sending you by the same mail the map Mr. McLean sent me, with the Hay-Reserves which we asked for marked on it, as requested by Mr. McLean. I enclose with this letter Extracts from the letter of Rev. L. Laronde, explaining the map and the reasons for his choice.\n\nMr. McLean promised to make application to The Department of the Interior on receipt of Map.

I went into this matter fully with the Principal on the 26th of July, and the estimate of the cost of clearing the 20 acres of stones and stumps, which is already cleared of the bush, was $400.00. This is one of the jobs that can not be very closely figured on, and it would be almost impossible at the present time to get anyone to figure on a job of this kind. Mr Laronde can do this work cheaper than anyone else on account of the boys cheap labour.\n\nI would recommend that the sum of $400.00 be granted for this work, the account for the expenditure to be certified to by the Agent I have instructed the Principal to haul all the stone to the point on the Island where the bridge to the mainland will be erected at a later date. There is a low bank on the Island side which requires filling and the large quantities of stone to be removed can be used for making an embankment at that point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

Lavonde\nOffice of the Pas Indian Agency.\n\nDec. 30th 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 789, amounting to $74.150\n\nfor Paying men for work on school grounds.\n\nThis Expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 373.371-5 Dated September 28th 1916.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI desire to place before you two of the needs of this school toward which I would respectfully ask the kind assistance of the Department.\n\n1. We need to bring more land into cultivation. The land is good, but it is wood land and very stony, and there is first of all plowing to do and then the stones to remove. If it were prairie land, where there is simply breaking to do, there would be no need for extra assistance, but breaking forest land involves a great deal of labour that is purely manual and necessarily expensive. We have now about 25 acres under cultivation, and, if we could have even twenty-five more, we should have a fair start. What we have under cultivation has helped greatly. Last season we raised over seven hundred bushels of potatoes and a fair crop of oats, besides over ten tons of roots and various vegetables. We were able to reduce our consumption of flour by at least sixty sacks, and we had no occasion to buy oats for our horses. From present appearances we shall have this year a larger crop of potatoes and oats, besides barley for our pigs, wheat for our poultry, and\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nPoveshell corn for our cows. Our root crop will not be as good as last year, but that is owing to destruction by cutworms. There is sufficient encouragement in farming to make one feel that it would be a great help to have more land under cultivation.\n\n2. It would be a great advantage if the road to the Reserve between this and the Big Eddy were improved. Most of the time during the season of open water, the only practicable way that we have of getting to the Oas is by boat between the Big Eddy and the Oas, and by wagon between the school and Big Eddy. Starting from the school, the road on the school island is good enough, and also on the gravel bed between the island and the mainland, for about a mile there is no improvement needed, then we come to a plough which should be corduroyed for about 100 yards. Then a distance of about 200 yards which is very muddy and sloppy, and then a steep hill which should be graded. The hill is mostly gravel. The work would be to grade the hill and draw the gravel to the lower part of the road.\n\nIn submitting these matters to your kind consideration, I am not losing sight of the fact that we should not ask for any extra expenditure in this time of need, but I would draw your attention to the fact that, owing to the attendance in the school being a good deal below the number allowed, our per capita grant is very much reduced.\nFor the last quarter we drew only $1806.75 instead of $2200 which we should have drawn if the School had been full. For the current quarter it will be about the same. Thus in two quarters we shall draw very nearly $800 below what we should have drawn with a full attendance.\n\nCould the Department allow us $200 for improving the road and $400 for raising more land under cultivation? Such help would be thankfully received and carefully applied. If it is taken into consideration, it may be considered advisable to refer the matter of improving the road to your Agent here.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\nYours obediently & sincerely,\n\nJ.A. MacKay\nJuly 29th, 1918.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nVenerable Archdeacon MacKay has asked for assistance to the extent of $400.00 to enable him to clear an additional 25 acres of land on Fisher Island for use in connection with the Pas Boarding School.\n\nIn view of the very satisfactory reports recently received from the Inspector and the excellent work that has been accomplished at this school, the Department has decided to assist him to that extent.\n\nWe shall honour accounts for labour to the extent of $400.00, upon receipt of vouchers certified to by the Archdeacon, under whose supervision the work will be conducted, and also by yourself.\n\nI am writing the Archdeacon to this effect today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 27th, 1928.\n\nDear Archdeacon MacKay -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 21st inst., in which you ask for some assistance towards granting an additional 25 acres of land on Fisher Island, and also for a grant towards the repair of the road leading to the Big Eddy Reserve.\n\nWhile the funds at the disposal of the Department are very limited, and it is almost impossible to undertake work of any magnitude this year, I feel that owing to the excellent work you have accomplished at this boarding school during the past year under abnormal conditions, that I would like to help you at least with the clearing of the land.\n\nThe Department will, therefore, honour accounts from you for labour, certified\n\nVen.

He states that there is a slough some distance from the school which should be corduroyed for about 100 yards, then a distance of 200 yards which is miry and stony, and also there is a steep hill which should be graded.\n\nHe asks for a grant of $200.00 to effect these improvements.\n\nI should be glad if you would let me have a report.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.373371-1 July 29th re clearing land at Mackay School. The Ven. Archdeacon Mackay was in the Office about this, wanting to know how these labor vouchers would be paid, and he requests that the Department send an advance check for $400.00, as all this labor will be done by Indians of the Pas Band, who are never able to wait for their money, to come from Ottawa, and in this way, the accounts could be paid here by Agency check, and certified vouchers sent down in the usual way, covering same.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Ontario\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter Aug 1st, 1918, re request of the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay, for road improvements, I beg to report that the place he specifies for repairs on this road, are certainly badly needed, but I am under the impression, that $200.00 will not nearly cover the work required, on this section.\n\nDuring the Summer months, and with the exceptions of when the water is high, the Mackay is almost inaccessible, on account of the Swamp, which surrounds the Island.\n\nThe specifications, given by the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay, merely covers the approaches, on the main land, and in order to fix the road properly, it would require a four ft. Rock fill, over three hundred ft. long, and a thirty foot bridge, to connect the Island, with the main land, there is any quantity of stone, piled on the Mackay School grounds, that would eventually have to be hauled away, and could be used for this purpose, and at the same time clean the fields, of rock.\n\nI intended to report on this before, but was informed by Mr. Inspector Jackson, that he had reported fully on the condition of this road, but that nothing could be done to it, until after the war.\n\nI would recommend that the $200.00 be granted the Archdeacon, as this would certainly help to im-\nSir,\n\nimprove the present conditions.\n\nThe bridge and rock fill could wait a while longer, or The Department could allow the school a certain amount per Cubic yard, to haul the rock from the fields, which is about a half a mile distant from where it is required, it would necessitate supplying the school with a low farm truck, which is badly needed there in any case.\n\nI have reported as fully as possible on conditions as they are at present and trust that this information is what is required.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nIndian Boarding School\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nAug. 10th 1918.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th inst., authorizing the expenditure of $400.00 towards bringing more land under cultivation on Fisher Island and to thank you for the same. Your instructions in connection with this expenditure will have careful attention.\n\nIt is also encouraging to note that my work at this school during the past year has earned your approval.\n\nHope and trust that the Department will be able to grant also the help that I have asked to improve the road.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs & Canada\nAugust 22, 1918.\n\nDear Archdeacon Mackay,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with further reference to your request for a grant to improve the road between the Mackay boarding school and the Big Eddy reserve. As the cost of this work would, from reports received, be quite extensive if any considerable improvement was to be effected, I regret that I cannot see my way clear to authorize any expenditure this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay,\nThe Mackay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nAugust 22, 1918.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 7th instant, in which you report on Ven. Archdeacon Mackay's request for a grant to improve the road between the Mackay boarding school and the Big Eddy reserve, I would state that, in view of the money allotted for the purpose of clearing further land for the school this year, the Department is not prepared to authorize any expenditure on the road.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd inst., informing me that you cannot authorize any expenditure this year on the road between this school and the Big Eddy Reserve, on account of the report received indicating that the cost would be extensive before any considerable improvement could be made, I beg to say that your Agent Mr. Macdonald informed me that he was recommending much more extensive improvements than I asked for. Certainly much more extensive improvements would be very desirable, but knowing the need for economy in the present condition of things, I\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\ndid not expect the Department to go into any heavy expenditure, and I only asked for a little necessary improvement. No one who is not living here can realise the inconvenience of this unfortunate site for the school. When the country is flooded, we have plenty of water to use our boat between the Pas and the school, but, as soon as the water subsides, we use the boat for over three miles from the Pas to the Big Coldy, and then have to use a team and wagon for the other three miles. This summer the water has been high enough for our boat to come up to the school for only about two weeks. The rest of the time we have to use the road, and even a little improvement would be better than none.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJ. H. MacKay\nIndian Affairs.

Three maps were enclosed, and I forward same to you. You will notice an outline in red on each map, and the Department asks me to mark in these limits the land used for hay purposes by the school.\n\nAs far as I can ascertain the land used is that I have marked in black ink - viz the S.E.Sec 27.\nE $\\frac{1}{4}$ E 22\nS.W. \" 23\nall in Twp 56, Rge 27, West of Principal Meridian.\n\nIf you have any information in reference to the land marked in red please advise me, as I cannot find anything on file. However, the Department must have had some application for this land or they would not have referred to it.\n\nThanking you for an early reply, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nRev. A. Minchin,\nPrincipal, Mackay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Mr. Waddly,\n\nIn answer to yours of the 11th inst., the fact marked in black ink on the plan of Township 56, Range 27, W. of P.M. viz., S.E. Sec. 27, E.\u00bd of Sec. 22, S.W. Sec. 23 represents the land on which the school has cut hay for some years and from which we took at least 20 tons this year.\n\nI think it might be well to sound this off by including the small portions of S.E. of Sec. 23, N.E. of Sec. 15 and N.E. and N.W. of Sec. 14 all enclosed by the bend of the Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe only occasions on which the school has cut hay further away have been in seasons of high flood and I cannot say exactly where this has been cut.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nArthur L. Maclean\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to letter 128/1-9 of the 4th inst., regarding hay lands for the MacKay Boarding School and maps enclosed, I have the honour to state that none of the land marked in red on these maps has been used for hay grounds for some years.\n\nI enclose a letter I received from the principal of the school describing the lands he used for hay purposes.\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson probably knows the land marked in red on the maps. I am not acquainted with it myself.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 27th October 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to Departmental letter of the 4th instant and your reply thereto, I have to inform you that at the request of the authorities of the McKay Boarding School a temporary reservation for haying purposes was secured for those areas not already within reserve, shown red on the enclosed township plans. An extract from the letter of the Rev. L. Laronde, who was Principal at that time is enclosed.\n\nThe Department of the Interior is desirous that all area in excess of absolute requirements be released and this Department wishes to comply with that policy as far as possible. In view of the letter from the present Principal, forwarded by you, it is thought that a definite statement should be obtained from the school authorities as to the tracts that should be retained for their purposes and if they do not desire any part of those tracts indicated in red, they should so state.\n\nBe good enough to request the Principal to go further into this matter in order that a release may be given for any lands not actually required. Plans enclosed should be returned with your reply.

I think the land allowed by the Department of the Interior is fair. I cannot see that this school will ever be able to support a large number of cattle. I think twenty-five or thirty head will be the limit for summer parturage on this island, and although I like to see lots of hay ground in Reserve, the land which is fifteen miles away from this school has not, up to the present, been used for hay land.\n\nI understand that the reason the Department of the Interior wants to cancel lots 107, 109, 111 and 113 is that this land is contained in what is known as the Sipanock Triangle, which is being surveyed at the present time, with a view of having it drained, and no doubt the Department wishes to have control of all the lands in this section, to help pay for the drainage and development scheme.\n\nIf we had ever used this land for hay grounds, I would certainly ask that it be kept for Indian Department school purposes, but I cannot see that we have a very strong claim on it.\n\nThe S.W. quarter of Section 23 and Fr. S.E. quarter of Section 22, Fr. N.E. quarter of Section 22 and Fr. S.E. quarter of section 27, Twp. 26, Range 27, West P.M., should be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs.

You will note that in our letter of the 16th May last the fact is also stated therein that it is necessary that the school should show that it has a larger number of stock to feed in the near future.\n\nBe good enough to keep this matter in view and when convenient go into the question thoroughly as to what lands are actually necessary for the wants of the school.

MacKenzie)\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\nMackay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOctober 7th 1921.\n\nJ. Waddy Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy,\n\nWith further reference to the hay-lands situated on the flats surrounding this island, I beg to report that owing to the unusually dry summer we were able to cut grass on portions of the land which are usually too wet. The whole of these flats is cut up by sloughs so that a large part of it is of no value as hayland. Even this year we have not cut more than 70 tons and have cut all the grass suitable for the making of hay. In an average year we could not cut many of the parts which we were able to use this season. Often the whole of these flats is under water during the early part of the year.\n\nAt the present time we have 23 head of stock and 5 horses to keep during the winter so that there will not be very much hay to spare. The number of stock is constantly increasing:- last year at this time we had only 18 head as against the 23 of this year.\n\nI believe that a little more of the land can be made suitable for hay as stock increases by getting rid of some of the willow.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\u2014 I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter 128-1-9 of the 30th ultimo, re hay lands for Mackay Boarding School.\n\nI have gone into this matter with the Principal and herewith enclose his remarks on the question. He states that they have 5 more animals to feed this year than last, and there is no doubt that the numbers will increase.\n\nIt seems as if we were applying for more land than is necessary, but if the Department of the Interior will survey out the sloughs and useless land they will see we need every acre asked for, as this year every dry spot was cut over and just produced 70 tons. I explained all this to one of the Inspectors of the Dept. of the Interior so they know the land is very poor, but there is no other land available as it is all swamp land in this vicinity. There is a drainage project in this district and the Dept of the Interior is anxious to keep all the land they control in case it becomes more valuable after the country is drained, but the school land is across the river from this drainage plot.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 26th October 1921\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, No.3703846, in which you request to the effect that evidence or proof should be filed by this Department of the necessity of obtaining more land for the use of the McKay Industrial school in Tp.56, R.27, W.1.M., I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter dated the 7th instant from the Principal of the school addressed to Mr. J.W. Waddy, Indian Agent.\n\nOn account of only parts of the land being useful for the purposes of cutting hay, it is evident that the lands applied for are required for the school. I have therefore to ask that the said lands be placed under the control of this Department. These lands were enumerated in a previous communication.\n\nI may repeat that they are the following, all situated in Tp.56, R.27, W.1.M.:\n\n- S.W.\u00bc Section 23\n- All of the S.E.\u00bc Section 22, East of the Saskatchewan River\n- N.E.\u00bc Section 22\n- S.E.\u00bc Section 27\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.B.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(N.O.Cot\u00e9)\nController.\nRegina, Sask., June 2, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honor to report that, according to your instructions I left Regina on the morning of the 18th of May and proceeded to The Pas, Manitoba for the purpose of inspecting the Agency.\n\nThe location of the school and hospital is something that I cannot understand, and it is hard to figure out what Inspector Jackson had in mind when he picked out this site, as it certainly would have been hard to find a more unsuitable place. The only way to get at the school at the present time from The Pas is up the Saskatchewan River. During high water one can go up the river past the school and up the creek with a canoe, but there is water in this creek only during the Spring floods so when they have subsided the creek again becomes dry. Therefore it is necessary to land at the bend of the Big Eddy about a mile from the school, and about half of this distance is through a marsh. I wish to point out that the matter of getting in and out of the school is a vital question, and something that should be looked into. The Frindin was of the opinion that a tunnel could be dredged through the marsh from the river in front of the school so that they could get up and down with a canoe. However, from what experience I have had, think that this would be impracticable, as the tunnel would gradually fill up with mud as the water would be practically still. I am of the opinion that the most economical and satisfactory method would be to put a road across the marsh. The distance I have mentioned is about half a mile and this could be filled up with brush and logs. As there are piles of stone that the school has hauled off the cultivated land these could be put on the top of the brush and logs in the winter time. During the month of August, I was informed, this marsh dries up pretty well. At that time with a couple of slushes the stones and brush could be covered with earth and in this way a good road could be made across the marsh, thus making the school much more accessible. To do this it will be necessary for the Department to give the school some assistance.\n\nThe matter of hay land for the school is another important question. There is no hay on the Island where the school is situated and during the last two years they have had to go seven or eight miles to get sufficient hay for their stock. There is good hay section across the river from the school which they have been endeavoring to get from the Department of the Interior without success. I understand it is held under lease by Mr. McNeil of the Pas. Steps should be taken, as soon as this land is available, to reserve it for the use of the school, as it is the only hay land in the vicinity of the Island, and is certainly very badly needed by the school.\n\nM. Christianson.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., June 9th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of a visit made to the Pas Agency by Mr. Inspector Christianson during the latter part of May.\n\nSomething will have to be done to open a road between the reserve and the school property. There is a half mile of marsh land there that no horse or vehicle can travel over at any time except in the dead of winter. It seems to me that some assistance will have to be given to put in a corduroy road covered with stones and earth. I understand there is sufficient timber and brush in close proximity to both ends of the roadway which could be used for filling in on top of the ground after which stones could be put in and the earth hauled on. However, it is a matter that would have to be handled by a practical man. I would not like to advance money to the school authorities to undertake the work.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 9th instant, forwarding Inspector Christianson's report on The Pas Agency, I wish to draw your attention to what he says about the matter of hay lands for the school. The Inspector states that there is a good hay section across the river from the school, which they have been endeavouring to get from the Department of Interior without success, and that it is held under lease by Mr. MacNeill of The Pas.\n\nI wish to point out that the section in question is 15-56-27-W.P.M. and is referred to by the Department of Interior as Ranch No. 10,658. I understand that Mr. MacNeill of The Pas has this land under lease and according to the agreement of the lease he is supposed to have so many head of stock on the land. At the present time Mr. MacNeill is not in the cattle business and from the information the Inspector gathered at The Pas he has not one head at the present time and is making no use of this land whatever.\n\nThe Department no doubt will see how necessary it is to have this land for the school and if possible arrangements should be made whereby it can be used, as this would save them several miles of hauling. I trust the Department will take this matter up with the Department of Interior.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 18, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-9 of the 12th instant, in which you draw attention to the need for more hay lands at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I will approach the Department of the Interior with reference to Sec. 15, T. 56, R. 27, W. first, and you will be further advised.\n\nI have also to refer to that portion of Inspector Christianson's report relative to the advisability of preparing a corduroy road from the school to the reserve. The Department considers the school management should be responsible for much of this work, as it is chiefly rough labour. You might enquire how much the school is prepared to do in this connection and then make a recommendation to the Department as to our assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMemorandum:\n\nSurveys Branch.\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Graham has strongly recommended that the Department secure Sec. 15, T. 56, R. 27, W. 1st, as hay lands for the MacKay Indian Residential School. Mr. Graham states that the Department of the Interior refers to this parcel as Ranch No. 10658. I presume that it might be described as that portion of Section 15 not covered by the waters of Saskaram Lake and not included within the limits of I. R. No. 21, Block K. (Township Plan contained in blue envelope, April 1916, this file).\n\nMr. Graham states that the school has been trying to get this parcel for hay lands for some time, but without success. Will you please take steps to ascertain if there is any hope of securing the land in question for the use of the school.\nOttawa, 20th June 1925\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIt is noted in Inspector Christianson's report that during the last two years it has been necessary for the school to go seven or eight miles to get sufficient hay for the stock and he recommends that an effort be made to obtain a portion of Sec.15, Tp.56, R.7. However, before the Department takes this matter up with the Department of the Interior, I should be pleased to have a full report from you on the present situation covering the following points:\n\n1. The number of tons of hay per month required by the school for winter feed.\n2. The number of months it is found necessary at your school to feed the stock.\n3. What were the conditions during the last two years which made it impossible to obtain sufficient hay from the 481 acres obtained for the school in July 1922 in Secs.22, 23 & 27-56-27?\n4. Is it expected that it will be the usual condition that the above area will produce an insufficient supply?\n5. If this 481 acres produced such a small quantity, are there not some parcels of it which could be returned to the Department of the Interior?\n6. An estimate of the number of tons which it is thought could be obtained from the portion of Sec.15 which it is now desired to acquire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs the river is rising rapidly and will soon flood the land adjoining the school, it is almost imperative that we secure some land, if possible Sec. 15 or we will be at the expense of buying 100 tons and the least that we might secure this would be at $12 per ton, total cost $1200.00.\n\nTrusting that the Department can secure this section as it will relieve us of a great anxiety and cost, both in hay, oats, and meat.\n\nI am Yours faithfully,\n\nRev.

Is it to be understood that the hay lands in Secs. 22 and 27 are generally under water?\n\nYou also state that you think it would be best to retain Sec. 23. Am I to understand from that that it should be satisfactory to retain the S.W.\u00bc Sec. 23 and to return to the Department of the Interior that portion of the S.E.\u00bc Sec. 22 lying North of the river, the N.E.\u00bc Sec. 22 and that portion of the S.W.\u00bc Sec. 27 not covered by the waters of Reader Lake and not included within the limits of the Indian reserve.

Kindly interview Mr. McNeill and request him to wire at our expense his permission for the Indians to cut the hay on this fractional section.\n\nI may say that Mr. McNeill's lease has a clause in it whereby he is not permitted to barter or sell the hay, so I do not anticipate any objection on his part.

I encourage them as far as possible, as I feel that they should not lose what trapping knowledge they have, or may gain, as in many cases they do a lot of trapping when they leave school.\n\nThey are not allowed to go off the school land, and I wonder if it is possible to have an order from your Department to prevent any Indian or Non-Treaty Indian trespassing on this land, so that the boys may be able to not only earn money, but retain the trapping knowledge that they have, as this land is only two sections in area, and is really surveyed land, and not connected with the Reserve in any manner. I would be very glad if you could advise in this matter, and if possible take some action with regard to it.\n\nThe boys have wanted to sign a petition to you asking that they might be protected from having their traps stolen or robbed.

Waddy Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:-\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that in Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Pas Agency, on page 12 under the heading of Schools he refers to the scarcity of hay, and mentions that there is a hay section across the river from the McKay School which they have been endeavouring to get from the Department of Interior, without success. This land was at that time held under lease by Mr. McNeil of The Pas. I am now advised that Mr. McNeil's lease has expired.\n\nThe section in question is 15-56-27, West of the Principal Meridian, and I would ask that the Department take this matter up with the Department of Interior with a view of finding out what arrangements can be made to get this land for the use of the school. The information I have is that it is badly needed. The land is just across the river from the school and it would be only a short distance to haul the hay in the winter time, whereas at present, I believe, they are hauling their hay seven or eight miles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 11th September 1926\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, I have to inform you that the grazing lease which covered in part Prec.Sec.15, lying west of the Indian reserve in Tp.56, R.27, W.P.M., has been cancelled and that the Department of the Interior has reserved the land in question for hay so that permits may issue thereon in favour of the MacKay Indian Industrial School. Mr. J.W. Waddy, the Indian Agent at The Pas, was advised on the 9th ultimo that the Agent of Dominion Lands at Dauphin would be in a position to issue permits on application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.W. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Pas, Man.\nSept. 5th, 1926.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the letter forwarded to you from The Bible House Winnipeg, re Section 16, Township 56, Range 27, W.B.M., dated end Sept., apparently the Authorities of my Society in Winnipeg, have made a mistake, in that it was not information re leasing this land, but is it possible to have this land transferred to the Mackay Boarding School, that was desired.\n\nIn a letter to Ottawa to the Deputy and Secretary of Indian Affairs, in July last year, I pointed out that if we were able to secure Section 16 in the above manner, that portion of the S.E. \u00bc Sec. 22, lying North of the River the N.E. \u00bc Sec. 22 and that portion of the S.W. \u00bc Sec. 27 not covered by the waters of Reader Lake and not included in the limits of the Indian Reserve could be returned to the Dominion Lands in return for Section 16.\n\nI feel sure that the School would ever be in your debt if such a transaction could be accomplished as it would not only guarantee sufficient hay, but would help us to put our farming activities on a paying basis, and I sincerely trust that you can assist us in this matter.\n\nMight I take the liberty to trouble you again and ask you, if any grants have been made yet, so that it may be possible to have the necessary repairs made here ere winter sets in, which I mentioned in my letter of the 28 of June, and which you answered to the contrary in your letter of the 23 ultimo No. 205-11A.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nSgd. Rev. E.V. Bird.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter 128-1-9 of the 11th inst. with reference to the fractional Section 15, lying West of the Indian reserve in Tp.56, Range 27, W.P.M. In this connection I beg to enclose a letter which I have received from the Principal of the school, from which it appears that the School Authorities desire to get permanent possession of this land in exchange for land that they already hold and which could be returned to the Department of Interior.\n\nI beg to recommend that a strong effort be made to secure this exchange and in the meantime, pending a decision, the fractional section 15 should be leased for the use of the school. May I request that the Department act promptly in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.A. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, 28th September 1926\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref. No. 205-11A\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st instant, I have to inform you that the information given in the copy of the letter which you received from the Principal of the McKay Boarding School does not appear to conform with his letter to the Department of July 13th 1925. In the last mentioned letter he states that he had marked in red the land which should be retained and accompanied his letter with a sketch, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nFrom this sketch and also from the Township plan, on which is indicated in red the lands already held for hay lands for the school, you will note that practically all the land he proposes giving up has not been secured by the Department for the school and his sketch distinctly shows that he desires to retain practically all the E.\u00bd Sec. 22.\n\nIf, as the Principal states in his letter to you of the 5th instant, it is the desire to relinquish that part of the E.\u00bd Sec. 22 lying to the East of Whitefish Creek, it is possible that the Department might be able to arrange an exchange for the part indicated in green on the Township plan. But, in the meantime, the interest of the school is protected as far as the hay on the W.\u00bd Sec. 15 is concerned, by the Department of the Interior having reserved the land for the issue of permits to the McKay Industrial school. The Interior Department, however, has stipulated that this hay is to be acquired by permits which are to be applied for when required.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive further information as to whether the school definitely wish to surrender the hay lands which have been reserved for them in the E.\u00bd Sec. 22.\n\nW.M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

B\u00bd 22, east of the Creek, the S.W.\u00bc of 22, and all of Section 26. He wishes to relinquish that portion of the S.E.\u00bc 27 West of the Whitefish Creek and the Fr. B\u00bd 22 West of the Whitefish Creek. He wishes to secure the N.E.\u00bc of Sec. 15, and that part of Section 22 West of the Saskatchewan River. It will be noted that the area that the Rev. Principal is willing to relinquish is considerably smaller than the area which he wishes to secure in exchange.\n\nI beg to return the plan of Township 56, which accompanied the Department letter above referred to, herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nW. M. Graham\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Indian Commissioner\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 26th November 1926\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith further reference to the correspondence relating to obtaining extra hay lands for the McKay boarding school, I am enclosing for your information a Township plan showing tinted in red the area which has previously been obtained as hay land; tinted in green the area which the Department of the Interior has reserved for the purpose of issuing the regular hay permits to the boarding school. This latter privilege was obtained after informing the Department of the Interior of the representations made by you that the lessee of Sec. 15 was not utilizing the area and, therefore, was not complying with the conditions of his lease.\n\nI am also enclosing a paper tracing sketch which is a duplicate of one received from the Indian Commissioner's office at Regina and supposedly represents the request made by you in Sept. and Oct. last. You will see from reference to the Township plan that the portion of Sec. 15 tinted green lies almost entirely in Block K of Indian reserve No. 21; the remaining part of it is within the area which is covered by the above mentioned arrangement with the Department of the Interior. Apart from this the sketch does not show that you require the hay from my portion of Sec. 15, which privilege was obtained as above mentioned after considerable correspondence with the Interior Department and after the Department was the cause of the existing lease on that section being cancelled.\n\nOf the lands indicated in blue which are shown as being not required, the Interior Department is very unlikely to consider those small portions in Sec. 27 as being of any importance in the exchange for other land, inasmuch as they are very small parcels and are situate between the land\n\nRev. E. Bird,\nPrincipal,\nMcKay Boarding School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nreserved for the boarding school and the waters of Reader Lake. The area in blue in Sec.22 is only 47.4 acres and that tinted green in Sec.22 is 136.1 acres. So it is very unlikely that the Interior Department would consider the exchange of the former for the latter, but an arrangement might possibly be made similar to that covering Frac. Sec.15.\n\nHowever, before having any further correspondence with the Department of the Interior in this matter, it is necessary that the Department be a little more clear as to the areas which are now required, as there seems to be a certain amount of confusion between your application referring to Sec.15 and your more recent application as embodied on the sketch on tracing paper and between your letter of Sept. 5th 1926 to the Indian Commissioner and your letter of July 13th 1925 to the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased, therefore, if you will give this matter your careful consideration and inform the Department of your present wishes so that the entire matter may be put clearly before the Timber and Grazing Branch of the Department of the Interior.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

E. Bird Principal\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter #128-1-9 of the 22nd ultimo regarding lands asked for by the Principal of the Mackay Indian Boarding School, I beg to say that I have asked Mr. Bird just what he desires and have pointed out to him that his original request was for part of Section 15 held under lease by Mr. McNeil.\n\nMr. Bird says he wants part of Sec 22 which is south of the Saskatchewan River, that this is the best soil and highest land. That he would appreciate anything that may be done to get this parcel of land, as well as Sec 15.\n\nIn any case he wishes the part of Section 15 which is outside the limits of Pas Reserve block K. What he wants is to get the land given to the school so that no hay permit fee will be paid annually by the school for hay cut, and so that he can feel at liberty to plow part of the land for raising forage crops.\n\nTrusting that this letter is more clear than the copy from the school principal, and that this will help to close out this matter,\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 21st January 1927\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department considers that it is necessary to have more land at the disposal of the MacKay Indian boarding school at The Pas. In order that a proper amount of stock can be maintained by the school, it is of course necessary to provide sufficient forage. The hay supply in this locality is, as you are no doubt aware, one which varies very greatly from season to season on account of the excess of flooding in the Saskatchewan waters. For instance, in the month of December it was reported to the Department that already a portion of the hay lands belonging to the school were partly submerged and that this fact, together with the spring floods, would prevent any hay being available on those portions next season. The island on which the school stands is composed chiefly of rock and low lying land; as a result there is a very small acreage surrounding the building which may be cultivated. It is necessary that the natural hay supply be supplemented by cultivated crops.\n\nWhile the arrangement which now exists with the Controller of Timber and Grazing, as set forth in his letter of 28th July last (copy of which is enclosed) augments the natural hay supply considerably, it does not provide the Department with the opportunity of cultivating such portions of this land as are suitable for the purpose of raising extra forage. From the information to hand this problem could be satisfactorily provided for if the following lands could be obtained by this Department for the purpose and use of the MacKay Boarding School,\u2014Frac.Sec.15-56-27-W.P.M., that portion of Sec.22-56-27-W.P.M., lying to the S.W. of the Saskatchewan River and this Department could relinquish those portions of Secs.22 and 27 lying W.of the Whitefish River. As the acquisition of these lands will have a very considerable effect on the economic administration of this school, I shall be pleased if this application can be given favourable consideration at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

INSPECTOR HAMILTON,\nDATED OCTOBER 31st, 1929, ON THE MACKAY INDIAN\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on 128-1-1.\n\nThe chicken house stands only a few feet from the girls' playground, which ground needs refencing and should be enlarged. If a capable man were in charge outside, this work could be done with little expense to the department and it would greatly improve the appearance of the school grounds.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, who recently visited the MacKay Indian Residential School, states that the chicken house stands only a few feet from the girls' playground and that the ground needs refencing and should be enlarged. I have to request that you will take this matter up with the Principal and arrange with him to have the chicken house removed to a more suitable location at an early date. The Inspector also states that if a capable man were in charge outside this work could be done with little expense and that it would greatly improve the appearance of the school grounds.\n\nPlease give this matter your prompt attention and report to the Department the action taken in having the chicken house removed to another location.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas Manitoba,\nNovember 15th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter #128-1-9 of the 7th instant re chicken house and fence at the Mackay Res. School, The Pas, Man.\n\nI beg to state that I visited the school on the 14th instant and took this matter up also inspected the buildings and fence in question.\n\nI find that the chicken house forms part of a workshop also covers a root house. Removing the chicken house alone would not in my mind better the situation. It seems to me impossible to move the building until Spring on account of the vegetables stored therein, as this is the only building available for the root house. With a little alteration I think these buildings would come in very useful for workshops in connection with the training that the Dept. intend to install in this school.\n\nRe the fence on girls playground, I would recommend that this be deferred until Spring as the ground is frozen to a considerable depth; also posts and pickets are not in too good a condition. Posts could be procured ready for operation and the playground enlarged as soon as the buildings moved.\n\nFor your information I may say that the present instructor Mr. Gibson is hopeless and all my instructions have failed to move him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 21, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the chicken house and the fencing of the grounds at the MacKay Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the moving of the chicken house and any alterations in fitting the building for workshops, also the fencing of the girls' playground should be brought to the attention of the Department next spring. At that time, full particulars should be given as to the cost involved in having this work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMay 15th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:- Re:- Removal of Hen-house & Work-shop:\n\nReferring to your letter #128-1-9 of the 21st, November 1929, in regard to the above mentioned buildings, I find it would be impossible to move them as they stand.\n\nThe work-shop is a very old building, the studdings at foot are not good. It has a concrete floor, and consequently no floor-joints to work on.\n\nThe hen-house is joined on to the work-shop and is practically in the same condition.\n\nI would suggest that the two buildings be taken apart and the lumber be used in building a proper hen-house.\n\nThere is a concrete foundation which can easily be used, two or three bags of cement being all that would put it in order. This foundation is in line with the barn, and was formerly used for a pig-pen.\n\nAs it is impossible to say how much lumber it would require in making this change, I would ask your approval to have the work done by day's work. I do not think it would require a great quantity.\n\nRegarding the enlargement of the girls playground, this also would have to be done by day's work, and I would ask your authority to purchase posts and wire for same.\n\nAll of which I would respectfully submit for your early approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the removing of the present old henhouse and workshop at the Mackay Indian Residential School and using any material of value therein in erecting a new henhouse, also with reference to the enlarging of the girls' playground and fencing same.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of removing the present henhouse and workshop and the building of a new henhouse. This work should be done on a day labour basis, under the charge of a competent carpenter, utilizing the services of the boys and staff as far as possible. The material in the old buildings should be used as far as possible in the erection of the new henhouse. You may arrange for the purchase of any extra material, cement, lumber, etc., required. It is expected that you will see that no unnecessary expense is incurred and that a satisfactory job is completed in erecting the new henhouse. This building should be of a type satisfactory for the purpose. It is noted there is a concrete foundation formerly used as a pigeon on which the new henhouse can be erected.\n\nRelative to the enlarging of the girls' playground, the levelling of same, if required, and the fencing, I have to say that you may also arrange to have this work done by day labour. You should purchase, to the best possible advantage, the quantity of posts and wire fencing required. When all the above work has been finished to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material supplied and for the labour in having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd A. S. Williams,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Tweddell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Agent Tweddell, The Pas, is being authorized to remove the present old henhouse and workshop at the MacKay Indian Residential School and use any materials of value therein in the erection of a new henhouse. He is also being authorized to enlarge and fence the girls' playground.

I am today in receipt of a communication in this connection from Dr. Westgate, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I consider it my duty to inform you that the animals which have already been provided are very much inferior to those which were destroyed.\n\n\"One of the cows had a hoof so greatly enlarged as to compel her to walk on the ball of the foot.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 580-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 21, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the replacement to the stock at the Mackay Indian Residential School. I regret to learn that two of the cows were not entirely satisfactory. I am writing to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham in this connection and will have a further communication for you at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nIn connection with the cows which I purchased last summer for the Mackay Indian Residential School at The Pas, I note in the Department letter No. 138-1-14 of the 21st inst., it states that the church authorities consider it their duty to inform you that the animals which have already been prilled, are very much inferior to those which were destroyed, and that one of the cows had a hoof so greatly enlarged that it was compelled to walk on the ball of the foot. Also that the same cow was minus a brush on her tail.\n\nI wish to inform you that 17 cows were bought by me at the same time, 10 for the Residential School at Pine Creek and 7 for the Mackay School. The animals were all thoroughly examined by me and I considered them all to be a fine lot of grade Holsteins, and in fact, most of them had more the appearance of Purebred animals but they were purchased from a third to a half less than pure animals could be bought at.\n\nYou had a letter from the Principal at Pine Creek who said:\n\n\"I beg to inform you that on the 26th inst. I have received in good order the 10 cows shipped from Nokomis and that I find them a fine lot of animals built up to give milk. Six were giving milk, and yesterday one of them calved.\"\n\n\"I must thank you sincerely for this appreciated help you have obtained for our school.\"\n\nThis shows what he thought of them, and the cows were practically all of the same class. I remember distinctly 2 cows out of the 17 which were the oldest in the bunch, were not quite as well up in flesh as I would have liked them to be, but I consider that they were the best milch cows in the whole bunch, and it was milking cows that I was buying, not beef cows.\n\nI am quite sure that the hoof on the cow in question, was alright when I saw her, and if she is now walking on the ball of her foot, it has happened since the time the cow was purchased. With regard to the same cow being minus a brush on her tail, this is too trifling a matter to deal with as I cannot\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nsay whether there was a few hairs short in the tail or not and if so, no doubt it will grow out again. The only reason the Principal has for complaining is that he wanted Purebred Ayrshires and when he got Holsteins he started to grumble his complaints. I got this verbally from Mr. Walsh when he was here last fall. If I am quite sure if the animals that he received were properly looked after and cared for as they should be, they will give good results.\n\nI might mention that these are the same kind of animals that were supplied to the Duck Lake School and Rev. Mr. Delmas is highly satisfied with the cows he got.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.C. Christison\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo #128-1-14, referring me to Department Letter 128-1-14 of June 25th, and my letter #205-11A of October 8th concerning the purchase of stock for the McKay Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that you are in receipt of a communication in connection with this matter from Dr. Westgate, in which he complains that the animals received were much inferior to those which were destroyed; that one of the cows had a hoof so greatly enlarged as to compel her to walk on the ball of her foot, and that this cow was minus the brush on her tail, also that another of the cows is so hard to milk that it is with difficulty any milk can be extracted from her.\n\nIn the first place I would point out that we were only buying grade Holstein cows, not thoroughbred Holstein cows, and that the price which we paid for these cows was about one-third what we would have paid had we been buying thoroughbred Holsteins. However, it was milk producers we were after and I believe that a fine lot of cattle were sent to the McKay School, notwithstanding Dr. Westgate's report to you.\n\nOn receipt of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOn receipt of your letter I took this matter up with Inspector Christianson, who happened to be in the office, and had him write me a report which is enclosed herewith. You will note from the Inspector's report that the seven cows and a bull which were shipped to the McKay School were part of a herd that was purchased by the Department. The other part were sent to the Pine Creek School. You will also note the report which I received from the Principal of the Pine Creek School, whom I believe to be a practical man. He is very grateful for the cattle which he received, and is well pleased with them.\n\nThe chances are that if one of the cows at the McKay School has an enlarged hoof it is a temporary ailment. She probably needs her toes trimmed so as to throw the weight on the hoof proper, instead of on the ball of her foot, and I doubt very much whether Dr. Westgate or Mr. Bird would understand this, neither of them being a practical man.\n\nSo far as I am concerned, I do not think that the Department should be called upon to replace any of the animals that have been sent there. I have every confidence in Mr. Christianson's judgement in this matter, which appears to be well backed up by the Principal of the Pine Creek School, who received ten out of the seventeen cattle purchased.\n\nMr. White, who supplied the cattle, was recommended to me by the Department of Agriculture here. I have had dealings with him before; I know the man well, and I know his stock. We bought cattle from Mr. White for other points and the parties who received them were well satisfied.\n\nIf Dr. Westgate was expecting thoroughbred Holsteins which would cost the Department in the neighborhood of $250.00 to $300.00 a head, he might as well be given to understand clearly that it was never the intention of the Department to supply animals of this type.\n\nI do not suppose that Dr. Westgate can be stopped from making complaints and finding fault, as he appears to be doing wherever he goes, but it is not very satisfactory to have this sort of thing going on all the time. The Department's officers have some intelligence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A of the 5th instant, concerning the milch cows which were purchased for the Mackay Indian Residential School. I am informing Dr. Westgate that you have reported the animals supplied were good grade Holsteins and that the Department does not purpose making any replacements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 9, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 16th instant, concerning the milk cows which were supplied to the Mackay Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham has reported fully in this connection and it is his opinion that good grade Holsteins were supplied. The officer who made the purchase is quite sure that the animals were all in good condition when shipped to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nThe Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant which arrived today, re the cattle supplied by the Department to take the place of those destroyed by order of the Veterinary Surgeon.\n\nWhen the Veterinary Surgeon visited us the first time, one cow was ordered to be killed; at his second visit, six cows and the bull were ordered to be destroyed; this was done; on his third visit during the first week in July another cow was destroyed by his orders.\n\nThe Agent was notified of the results of each visit to the Veterinary Surgeon; the last notification was during the first week in July, when Mr. Bishop the Surgeon and myself informed Mr. Waddy in his office that another cow had been destroyed.\n\nAbout the second or third week in August, as I arrived in The Pas by canoe, I observed some cattle being loaded on a barge; on investigation I found that they were for the Mackay School; on seeing the Agent I mentioned what poor condition they were in, and that it was not with travelling, and that one cow had an enlarged hoof and the end of her tail nipped off (minus the Brush). He mentioned that he had milked them that morning, and found one cow was so hard to milk that it took him all his time to milk her as her teats were very hard to squeeze. I asked him how it was that the full number had not been supplied to replace those destroyed, and was surprised to find that the last cow killed had not been reported. He was leaving that day to go to Regina. On the day he returned Mr. Grant and I met him on the Street, and he expressed the hope that I had not put in a very adverse report on the new cows to your office giving us to understand that he had been up before Mr. Graham, but not telling us what transpired. I mentioned about the cow again and he said that there was plenty of time to report about her at a later period. This is the last I have heard in regard to the cows with the exception of receiving the papers of the bull, which I had applied for at an earlier date. Mr. Grant will corroborate the above statements if necessary.\n\nWith reference to the quality etc., I beg to submit the following statements:\n\n1. The animals supplied are very much inferior to the old stock - take about 30 per cent more feed to keep up.\n2. One cow had an overgrown toe and walked on the ball of the foot (this has improved somewhat).\n3. The cow mentioned in No. 2 had her tail cut off at the end, there being no brush on the end, apparently done at a recent date as the end of the tail was raw.\n\n4. One cow is about as hard a cow to milk, as any cow that I have ever milked.\n\nI most certainly do not consider that the animals supplied are in any way equal to the former stock, and this is the opinion of all who knew the former stock.\n\nTrusting this covers all the information required.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(SGD) Rev. E. V. Bird,\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 14, 1926\n\n41-43 The Bible House\nAlexander Avenue\nWinnipeg.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: MILK COWS SUPPLIED TO MACKAY SCHOOL\n\nWith further reference to my letter of December 16th 1925 and your replies of December 21 and January 9th (128-1-14) relative to the stock supplied to the Mackay School to take the place of those destroyed by order of the Veterinary Director General Health of Animals Branch, I now beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter which was addressed to me by the Principal of the Mackay School on December 12th last, in which is set forth the condition of the stock in question at the time of their arrival at the school. In the light of the information which this letter contains, I beg respectfully to inform you that our Society is unable to accept the statement of the \"Officer who made the purchase\" that he \"was quite sure the animals were all in good condition when shipped to the school\". I beg to state further that if Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham was informed that good grade \"Holsteins were supplied\" to this school in place of the cattle destroyed, this information was not in harmony with the facts. The cattle which were destroyed were \"good grade Holsteins,\" while those which were supplied to take their place are, from my observation, of a very much inferior quality, and possess the defects set forth in the enclosed letter of the Principal.\n\nI beg to request therefore that further consideration be given to the opinion set forth in the last paragraph of my letter of December 16th that three more cows be added to this herd, and suggest that an authorization be forwarded to me for the purchase to be made by the School Management, such authorization to\nspecify the amount which might be paid per head, and the amount allowed for transportation expenses.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 21, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, concerning milch cows purchased for the Mackay Indian Residential School. I regret that the Department cannot replace the two animals which have been reported as somewhat unsatisfactory, in view of Mr. Commissioner Graham's report and recommendation. I am asking him, however, to arrange at the first convenient opportunity to supply one cow to the school to replace the extra one that was slaughtered by order of the Veterinary Director General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, January 21, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the number of milch cows at the Mackay Indian Residential School, which were destroyed by order of the Veterinary Director General, was eight, and, as only seven cows were replaced, the Department has decided to allow an extra one. At the first convenient opportunity, you should see that a good grade milch cow is supplied to this school. A voucher should be forwarded in the usual manner for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. J.W. Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas, informing me that the bull in use at the McKay Boarding School had to be destroyed on account of its leg having been broken by a kick from a horse.\n\nIn January, 1926, the Department gave authority to furnish this School with another milk cow but as no suitable animal could be found in the locality, no purchase was made. The Principal asks if the grant allowed for the purchase of a cow may be diverted to the purchase of a bull. Will you please advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 12th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 205-11A C.E. of the 8th instant, informing the Department that the bull in use at the Mackay Indian Residential School was destroyed on account of his leg having been broken. The authority which was granted in January, last, for the purchase of an extra cow may be diverted to the purchase of a bull to replace the animal destroyed. This authority is granted on the condition that the school will themselves purchase the cow. You should see that a young bull of a type considered satisfactory by you is purchased, and the animal secured should be free from tuberculosis.\n\nThe animal destroyed was, no doubt, not a total loss, as the carcass could be used for beef at the school or sold, and it is considered that the value received should be applied by the school towards the purchase of the extra cow.\n\nThe animal purchased by you should be obtained as cheaply as possible, and certified vouchers covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 3, 1927.\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the MacKay Boarding school, the Pas, Manitoba and Assiniboine Reserve, Sintaluta, Sask.\n\nMacKay Boarding school.\n\nI must say the children had a well balanced diet with the only exception of too much tea and not enough milk. However Mr. Bird the Principal explained the reason for this as follows: That the cows sent up to replace the herd destroyed for T.B. did not give half the quantity of milk that the previous cows had done and it now was impossible to supply the large number of children at the school and especially during the winter months, but in the summer the cows give more but not sufficient.\n\nElsie Phin.\nTravelling Nurse.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Travelling Nurse who visited the MacKay Indian Residential School states, in a report which she submitted to the Department, that, while the children had a well balanced diet, there was not sufficient milk. Please draw this to the attention of the Principal and inform him that the Department requires that an ample supply of milk be furnished the pupils. The younger pupils especially should receive milk each day, as it is one of the most important items in their diet. I shall be pleased to hear later regarding the quantity of milk supplied daily for the pupils' use and whether you consider same ample or not. It is thought that this school should have a sufficient number of cows to give all the milk necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nMay 6th 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to letter #128-1-14 of the 25th ultimo regards supply of milk to the pupils at the Mackay Indian Residential School, I beg to state that the Principal informs me that the cows there are now giving more milk than during the winter, but that the animals do not appear to thrive on the rough forage at that place. From the amount of milk he gets it would appear that the pupils are not receiving enough. I asked him if he wanted more cows and he states he has no room for more, unless we culled out a couple and replaced them with others which would be more suitable to the district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the milk supply for the pupils at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal should do the very best possible to arrange for an adequate supply of milk. If any of the cows at present at the school are unsuitable, they should either be killed for beef purposes or exchanged for new cows of a suitable type. The cost of obtaining any new milch cows should be provided by the school from its per capita grant or other receipts. We will be pleased to have a further report at a later date as to any steps taken to provide the supply of milk necessary at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:-\n\nOn the 8th ultimo I wrote informing you that the Principal of the McKay Boarding School in The Pas agency had made a request to have a new bull purchased for his herd, in lieu of a cow which they were authorized to purchase some time ago. This authority was granted on condition that the school purchase the cow, as an additional cow was considered necessary and I wrote Mr. Waddy to this effect.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Waddy in which he informs me that the Principal states he is not in a position to purchase a cow and this is, of course, not satisfactory. You are aware that the Nurse reported this school as not having an adequate supply of milk for the children. You are also aware that the Principal has stated that the cows which were sent to the school were not of a good quality. This is absolutely wrong; we have proof to show that he got real good cows from an accredited herd. I sent the Inspector all the way from Regina - a day's trip on the train - to see these cows, and he reported them as being highly satisfactory. Unless cows are properly fed they will not give the milk, no matter how well bred they may be. My own opinion is that they are not getting the proper feed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A C.E. of the 10th instant, with reference to the purchase of a cow at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I am today writing Mr. Indian Agent Waddy to the effect that the school must supply this extra animal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 11th instant, concerning the milk supply at the MacKay Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the Department lately authorized Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham to purchase a bull for this institution. This authority was granted on the condition that the school, itself, will purchase a cow. Please inform the Rev. Principal that the Department expects this action will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret to have to direct your attention once more to the stock which was supplied by your Department to the Mackay School in December 1925 to take the place of those which were destroyed by order of the Health of Animals Branch, but a letter which has just been received from the Principal in connection with the milk supply necessitates this action.\n\nOn March 16th, last the Principal wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy stating that as the bull had been kicked by a horse and had to be shot, he requested, in view of the fact that as your Department had only supplied 7 cows in place of the 8 which had previously been destroyed by order of the Health of Animals Branch, a bull be purchased in place of the cow which was due, and to replace the bull which had recently been shot.\n\nIn the Principal's letter just to hand and dated May 5th, he states that your Department has agreed to buy a bull but accompanied this promise with the request that our Society should purchase another cow as the nurse had reported that the younger children should have more milk.\n\nBefore our Society can undertake to meet this additional expenditure, I beg to remind you, as briefly as I can, of the correspondence which has already passed between us in connection with the quality of the animals which were shipped to the Mackay School by Commissioner Graham towards the close of 1925. This correspondence is as follows:\n\n1. On April 9th, 1925, (letter 13-0-14) your Department agreed to replace animals destroyed by order of the Director General of\nthe Health of Animals Branch.\n\n2. On June 25th, 1925, (letter 128-1-14) you informed me that you had instructed Mr. Commissioner Graham to replace the 8 cows and 1 bull which had thus been destroyed.\n\n3. On December 16th, 1925, I informed you that only 7 cows and 1 bull had been purchased to replace those mentioned under section 2 above, and that these were of an inferior quality to those destroyed.\n\n4. On December 21st, 1925 (letter 128-1-14) your Department replied stating that you were referring the matter to Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\n5. On January 9th, 1926, your Department wrote again stating that the officer who had purchased the animals declared that all were in good condition when shipped to the School.\n\n6. On January 14th, 1926, I again wrote to your Department enclosing a copy of the Principal's letter dated December 12th, 1925, and requested an authorization to purchase 3 more cows. One to take the place of the 8th cow destroyed by order, and 2 to take the place of others which had been sent which were practically worthless.\n\n7. On January 21st, 1926, your Department replied to this letter stating that in view of the Commissioner's report you could not purchase the 2 cows mentioned above but were authorizing Mr. Commissioner Graham to purchase one cow in place of the one which had been omitted from the first shipment.\n\nIt is clear from the above correspondence that the animals which were supplied by your representative to take the place of those which were destroyed have never been accepted by our Society as a satisfactory replacement, and in the Principal's letter just received and dated May 5th, 1927, arising out of your request that our Society should increase the milk supply at this School by the purchase of another cow, he offers the following comment on the animals which you supplied:\n\n\"These animals may be called cows by some people, but I can only call them GULLS. Their last year's record has been far below that of the ordinary cow, and this, in spite of them being fed practically as the Agricultural Department would have fed them. We have not room for more animals, but what we require are COWS, and not such animals as we have been obliged to accept from the Department. Although 5 of these cows have freshened since January 20th last, yet from these we receive only 3 gallons of milk a day. We can only call them BOARDERS and I consider that the Department should give us any additional animals required equal to, and to take the place of those destroyed.\"\nIn the light of the above correspondence it seems to me to be a reasonable request that your Department should purchase any additional cows required. The animals supplied by Mr. Commissioner Graham were reported at the time of their arrival as utterly unsatisfactory, and our subsequent experience with them has fully confirmed the opinion set forth in that report. It does not seem to me, therefore, quite fair to our Society that we should be asked to meet any additional expenditure in connection with any increase in the milk supply which may be necessary at the Mackay School, and I shall be obliged if you will reconsider this matter and authorize the Commission to purchase 2 more good grade cows in the immediate future.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, May 18, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the milch herd at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I have read your recapitulation of the correspondence concerning the cows that were supplied by this Department some time ago. I do not consider there is any merit in asking for a further report from Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina, who is responsible for the purchase, as this officer's statement has already been secured and has been made known to you. I have lately authorized the purchase of a bull and have written stating that the school authorities should secure one milch cow.\n\nIf you will see that one cow is purchased and paid for by the Society, the Department will pay for a second one, and you are authorized to arrange for the purchase. You may forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the animal. I would suggest a price of not more than $90, f. o. b. The Pas. I should be grateful if you would write to the Rev. Principal immediately, explaining the Department's proposal, so that there will be no misunderstanding.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.H.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the Acting Principal of the Mackay Indian Residential School reports that they should have fifteen acres more land broken at the school. His explanation is that if he had the land broken he could raise oats and green feed and supply the milk cows and live stock with food at much less expense than it is done at the present time.\n\nI fully concur with him in his opinion that he should have more land broken. All they have at present being just enough for vegetables and root crop, with a small patch of oats. The school is situated on a very rocky island covered with timber, but most of the timber has been cut off, just leaving the small poplars. Much of the land is very rocky. He asks in the first place to be supplied with a small Fordson Caterpillar Tractor, with a braking plough attached. He would also want an appropriation for cutting off the brush and probably some assistance in tearing out the roots, and for labor breaking the land. The whole appropriation which would be required would amount to about $2000.00 and for this sum he would have his land cleared and would also have the Fordson Tractor and the plough left over after the operations are completed, and he requires a tractor in order to replace the teams at the school, which are getting very old.\n\nI did not put this in the estimates, as I had not discussed it with the former Principal, but I strongly recommend that if possible this school be supplied with as large a grant as possible for the purpose noted when the funds can be obtained. Mr. Turner is doing the best he can at this school, and is bringing it along in very good shape.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, January 7, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 6262/135 of the 28th ultimo, with reference to breaking 15 acres of land at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I note that a Fordson Caterpillar Tractor, with breaking plough, etc., at an approximate cost of $2,000, would be required. I regret to inform you that there are no funds for this purpose at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Naddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nAGENTS REPORT RESPECTING MACKAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FOR\nTHE MONTH OF MARCH 1928.\n\nLast year the Department told the school authorities they would supply a cow to the school if the church authorities purchased one. They have recently purchased a good cow and they ask me if I will get authority to supply the one promised by the Department, the cost would be about $100.00\n\nJ. W. Waddy,\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 13th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the MacKay Indian Residential School for the month of March, last, relative to the supplying of a cow, it is noted that the Church authorities have purchased and paid for a cow. This Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $100 in the purchase of a good milch cow, and you may arrange to obtain same. You should see that the cow which you purchase is young, has freshened, and is free from tuberculosis. It might be well to ascertain, before making the purchase, whether the cow has been given the tuberculin test.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, which should not exceed the above authorized amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

This cow was satisfactory to the Principal of the school and has been certified as being free from tuberculosis by the Vet. Surgeon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nThe cows are not giving much milk at present, though nine are milking, so the pupils are not receiving much milk.\n\nThe feed for the live stock there is going to be quite a problem this winter. Last summer there was a flood in the Saskatchewan valley and hay could not be procured until late in August, and then it was of very poor quality swamp hay. A little hay was cut on the land given the school two years ago but this was also flooded and is poor stuff.\n\nThe cattle and horses are as follows:\n\n| Cows in Milk | 9 |\n|-------------|---|\n| Dry cows    | 2 |\n| Bull        | 1 |\n| Yearling heifer | 1 |\n| \" steers   | 2 |\n| Heifer calf | 1 |\n| Steer calf  | 6 |\n| Horses      | 5 |\n\nTo support the above, the supply of hay on hand is only about 50 tons. It would first appear as if we should request the school authorities to beef the young steers, with hay at twenty dollars a ton sure it will not pay to raise them just now. This would leave nineteen animals. There are two or three old cows here that could be beefed and cut down the expensive cost of feed also, but they would have to be replaced with others. If the school people eat the beef of the cows they could allow the value of this beef at time new cows are purchased, but I presume the Department would be asked to assume the balance. I am just suggesting these moves to save money, they could be avoided of course by supply of feed.\n\nIn any case, the horses should be given a good supply of hay or they will die, they are losing flesh rapidly from lack of nourishment from the swamp hay. At least ten tons of first class hay should be provided for them very soon, and a supply of hay of good quality supplied for a few of the best milking cows.\nOttawa, December 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your 317-135 of the 24th ultimo, which relates to live stock at the MacKay Indian Residential School. I am writing to the church authorities in this connection, and your recommendation will receive their consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, December 5, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Waddy reports that feed for live stock at the MacKay Indian Residential School will be a serious problem this winter. To support 27 head of horses and cows, there is but 50 ton of hay. Our representative recommends that the school authorities beef young steers and two old cows and that the church authorities apply the value of the beef towards the purchase of new cows at a later date. If you concur, please inform the Department and give instructions to the Reverend Principal.\n\nI wish to add, also, that Mr. Waddy states the five horses should be given a good supply of hay, as they are losing flesh rapidly from lack of nourishment in the swamp hay, which they are being fed. Will you please arrange to purchase at least 10 tons of first class hay for the horses and a suitable supply of hay of good quality for the use of the best milking cows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If you will examine my letter of the 5th instant in this connection, you will find that I did not authorize the purchase of hay and the forwarding of accounts to the Department for payment. My request was that the school management make arrangements for a suitable supply of feed to safeguard the stock at this school. Feed for stock and food for children is distinctly in the category of current expenses and, as such, must be met from the per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

A note has been taken for future estimates.\nSir:-\n\nI have a letter today from Mr. Tweddell, Indian Agent at The Pas, with which he enclosed a list of cattle that should be disposed of, at the McKay Indian Residential School. I do not know whether you wish Mr. Tweddell to have anything to do with the school or if you wish to deal direct with the Church authorities in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

However, before the Department can decide regarding the disposal of any cattle, it will be necessary to have a copy of Mr. Tweddell's letter, which it is presumed supplies full information as to the reasons for disposing of the cattle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Only sick cow not fit for beef, pus running from hind quarters also from shoulder.\nThe Pas, Man.\nOctober 29th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose list of cattle at the Mackay Indian Residential School, The Pas, Man.\n\nThe numbers 2, 3 and 4 would with a little feed make what I would consider good beef. The sick cow I would recommend to be destroyed as it is not in good shape and I don't think even if fed on chop would make good beef. This cow has been injured in some unknown way.\n\nThere is a severe abrasion on the left shoulder which is suppurating also on the right hip. I would say that it would take too much time and money to do anything with it.\n\nThe above listed cattle I would recommend to be disposed owing to their non-producing qualities.\n\nKindly instruct me in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. G. Swedell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Department No. 128-1-14 of the 6th instant, I enclose copy of a letter written by Mr. W. G.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 205-11A C.E. of the 9th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from Mr. Agent Tweddell, The Pas, relative to the cattle at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is considered that it would be advisable for the school authorities to destroy the sick cow referred to by the Agent, and after special feeding of the three other cows referred to they could be used for beef purposes. I would point out that the department has supplied a number of cattle to this school, and it is considered that replacements in future should be provided by the school authorities from the natural increase or by purchase from their per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 125-1-14 of the 16th instant relative to the cattle at the McKay Indian Residential School. I note you consider it advisable that the school authorities should destroy the cow which is suffering from abrasions on the left shoulder and right hip. You also suggest that after special feeding of the three other cows referred to they might be used for beef. I am quite satisfied that by the time the Department buys feed for these cows in order to get them into beefing condition it will not be very profitable. Feed is very expensive this year, and I doubt if they will be able to put much beef on them. Before instructing the Agent to follow out this procedure I would ask if the Department are not putting themselves in the position of having to replace these cattle. Would it not be better to leave it to the Church authorities to decide as to what should be done regarding the matter of disposing of them? I make this statement, as I note from your letter that you think the replacement should be made by the school authorities. Kindly advise me as to this.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. L. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A C.E. of the 21st instant, relative to the cattle at the MacKay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department agrees with you that the matter of the disposal of the cows referred to should be left in the hands of the Church authorities, as all replacements should be made by them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some months past the question of the provision of a motor truck for the Mackay School has been giving our Commission much anxiety. They instructed the Principal to take the matter up with the local Indian agent and he has made the suggestion that the motor launch be sold and the proceeds applied towards the cost of a truck. As a comparatively good motor road has been made between the school and The Pas since the motor launch was provided some years ago, our Commission instructed me to ascertain if your Department would agree to the suggestion made by the Indian Agent. I am unable at present to state the amount which might be received from the sale of the launch, but the proceeds of the sale would leave a considerable amount still to be found to meet the cost of a truck. I shall be glad to know, therefore, if your Department would be willing to provide the amount still required to meet the total cost of the truck, over and above the amount secured from the sale of the launch.\n\nIn the list of requirements submitted by our Society to your Department last autumn, and to be provided this year, the sum of $1,000.00 was included for the purchase of a motor truck. As the proceeds from the sale of the launch would reduce this amount considerably, I trust that you may be able to provide the balance required.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nOttawa, Sept. 3, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to turning in a motor launch and securing a truck for the use of the MacKay Indian Residential School. I note that there is now a motor road. The Department is writing to Mr. Indian Agent Tweedell in this connection and whatever funds are necessary will be provided for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I should be glad to have your recommendation, with estimate of the cost, in this connection. It should be kept in mind that this exchange would not be made until next year, when funds would be provided for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G.

At present the water is so low that boats are of very little use, and have no sale. Should the water raise there might be a chance to dispose of it at a big sacrifice.\n\nA Ford truck would be very useful, and would cost about $1050.00 here, set up.\n\nThe MacKay Indian Res. School is seven miles from The Pas, and they have been using horses, taking the best part of a day for the trip.\n\nThe truck I would recommend, but think that chances for a return from the sale of the launch would be nil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst., Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, September 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 296-135 of the 9th instant, with reference to selling the motor launch and purchasing a truck for the use of the MacKay Indian Residential School. I note you are hopeful that the launch could be sold. The Department wishes the Reverend Principal and yourself to bend every energy towards securing a satisfactory price for the launch. If success meets your efforts, inform the Department, and if funds can be found, the deal will be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G.

Original on File No. 190292\n\nBoarding Schools. There are three points in the\nNorthwest where boarding schools from our point of\nview are urgently needed. First at Battle River, in\nSamson's Band; Second, Whitefish Lake, or between Whitefish\nLake and Saddle Lake, in connection with Pakan's Band;\nThird, At Norway House as a centre from which quite a\nnumber of bands can be reached. At these points the\nexpenditure need not be very large. In each case pro-\nbably $2000 would provide a building large enough to begin with.\n\nAt Norway House, we are very desirous of instituting\nmedical and hospital work, and if the necessary buildings\nand outfit are provided for by the Government, I think\nthat we can provide the Doctor and the Nurses. Of the\ngreat importance of work of this kind among the Indians,\nI need not speak, and perhaps there is no other centre\nfrom which so many can be reached as at Norway House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

When his report comes to hand the information will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\nSir,- I have the honor to transmit herewith a \"blue print\" copy of a design which has been prepared for the proposed boarding-school building at Norway House. The elevations are not yet quite ready, but are in course of preparation and will be sent shortly. Instructions have been given that everything connected with the building should be severely plain, out of good material, strong and substantial. As the summer is rapidly passing it is desirable that work on this building should be pushed forward without unnecessary delay. I do not know what may be the intention of the Department concerning this work; but as the Government has its own trusted agents at Winnipeg, I venture to suggest that the best way may be for them to take charge of the matter, and have the building erected at as early a date as possible. Letters just received from Norway House state that the Indians are very much gratified with the prospect of a boarding-school at that point, and I can assure the Superintendent General that when once the building is ready for occupation nothing will be lacking on our part to make the school a success. I will be glad to be informed if the design which has been submitted meets with the approval of the Department. It will be seen at once that the building as planned will not accommodate more than 50 pupils, and that care has been taken to avoid unnecessary expense.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As the grant for of $3000 towards this buildings lapses on the 30th June, it would appear that the work should be undertaken with as little delay as possible, and I should be glad if you would kindly inform me as to whether the plans above referred to are approved or, at your earliest convenience.\n\nDr Sutherland also suggests that this work be undertaken under the direction of your Agent at Winnipeg, and the Department would like to know whether this plan is feasible.\n\nE.

If the work is to be done by the Public Works Department, we could not very well go further than this. If, on the other hand, it is finally decided that we should do the work, the plans as already provided, with the outline of specifications which I will send herewith, would have been sufficient; because where work is to be done at a place like Norway House, it is practically impossible to cover every thing by minute specifications, and much will have to be left to the judgment of the builder. If we were doing the work it is not likely that a contract would be asked except for materials; but we would select a thoroughly competent and trustworthy builder, pay him reasonable wages for the time he is employed, and entrust him with the task of getting up such a building as is required, not to exceed certain limits as regards cost. We have found in other instances that by this plan we got better work, better material, and at less cost, than by the ordinary contract plan. This will explain why the specifications...\nsent herewith are much less minute than they would have been under other circumstances; indeed they are intended rather as general directions for the builder that may be employed than as complete specifications upon which to base a contract.

Sir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 1st instant in respect to plan and specification for the proposed boarding school at Norway House, I beg to say that the Chief Architect of the Public Works Department states that in the case of buildings that will become the property of the Government and to which the Government is contributing the largest share of the cost, his Department undertakes the supervision of the construction; but as in the present instance $3000 will probably be only a small proportion of the cost, and the building when finished, will not be the property of the Government, he does not think his Department would undertake the construction.\n\nThe Chief Architect adds, however, that it is his opinion that complete plan and specifications and an estimate of the whole cost ought to be furnished for the satisfaction of the Government, and that a guarantee should be given of the time within which the building will be finished, whether one, two or three years, as the case may be.\n\nRev. A Sutherland, B.D.\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto\nSir,\n\nI am forwarding by today's mail new sections plans of the proposed Boarding School building at Norway House. When these are received you will have in your possession all the information or suggestions that we can give respecting this undertaking.\n\nReferring now to your letter of September 13th, No. 168918, I have no doubt that the Chief Architect of the Public Works Department is correct in supposing that $3000 will be only a part of the cost; but he is mistaken in assuming that the building when finished would not be the property of the Government. Our understanding has been that buildings erected with Government money must necessarily be Government property, as, for example, the Institute building at Muncey, or the Institute at Brandon. As before explained we sent plans and general specifications merely to indicate the size of the building that we thought necessary to accommodate 50 pupils, and general arrangement that will be the most convenient for the work to be done.\n\nI presume that it is now too late for any part of the work of construction to be done this season; but if the Agents of the Government were instructed to proceed with the preparation of material a great deal might be done this winter, and the material all be got ready for shipping with the first opening of navigation next spring. Then if\nthe work were pushed with reasonable rapidity, the building would be ready for occupation in the early autumn of 1899.\n\nTrusting that these explanations will be satisfactory, and that contracts will be speedily given out for the necessary material,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 17th October, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Sutherland has just forwarded new section plans of the boarding school proposed to be erected at Norway House, Manitoba, towards which the department is contributing $3000.\n\nI beg to inform you of the position of this matter.\n\nNo reply having been received from the Department of Public Works to the letter from this Department of the 6th September explaining the desire of the Methodist Church that the Government should supervise the erection of the building, with your consent I went over and saw the Chief Architect about the matter; and on the 13th September the following letter, in accordance with the Deputy Minister's verbal instructions, was written to the Rev. Dr. Sutherland.\n\n\"With further reference to your letter of the 1st instant, in respect to plan and specification for the proposed boarding school at Norway House, I beg to state that the Chief Architect of the Public Works Department states that in the case of buildings that will become the property of the Government and to which the Government is contributing the largest share of the cost, his Department undertakes the supervision of the construction; but as in the present instance $3000 will probably be only a small portion of the cost (which it is presumed will be in the neighbourhood of $12,000), and as the building when finished will not be the property of the Government, he does not think his Department would undertake the construction.\n\n\"The\n\"The Chief Architect adds, however, that it is his opinion that complete plan and specifications and an estimate of the whole cost ought to be furnished for the satisfaction of the Government, and that a guarantee should be given of the time within which the building will be finished, whether one, two, or three years, as the case may be.\n\n\"This Department would be glad to see the suggestions of the Public Works Department carried out, but as it desires to avoid asking for anything that might be construed as preventing the work of construction being proceeded with at once it does not insist on these suggestions being complied with.\n\n\"The grant of $3000 will be paid either on completion of the whole building or in instalments on properly certified vouchers presented as the work proceeds.\"\n\nIn his last letter, in reply to the above, Dr. Sutherland again urges that the Government undertake the work of erection; but as he does not state what the total cost of the building is estimated to be, nor how the Church will pay the money, I do not think the Public Works Department will be in a position to give an answer in the matter without further information, judging from what the Chief Architect told me, even if this department should decide to ask that Dr. Sutherland's request be complied with.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, the Revd. Dr. Sutherland, as per extract from letter in I95270, states;\u2014\n\n\"It had not been our intention to send complete plans and specifications, but merely sufficient to indicate what size and kind of building we judged to be necessary.\" I would, however, consider it important that a proper specification should be prepared, as for instance in the present specification, the plumber's clause merely states that provision is to be made to properly fix 2 baths and 12 wash-basins in the girls' wash-room and the same number in the boys' wash-room, but is neither stated whether these baths, &c., are to be made of iron, copper, slate or other material and no mention is made as to whether the pipes are to be of iron or lead.

I may say that this Department has not seen any reason for altering its opinion since the date of the letter.\n\nI now enclose herewith a copy of a letter of the 6th instant from the Department of Public Works transmitting a report from the Chief Architect on the plans submitted by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I sincerely hope that these two items will pass without fail.\n\nI am also informed by the Rev. John McDougall that the Indian Commissioner for the North West strongly favours our wish for a Boarding School at White Fish Lake, Alta., and has promised to recommend the matter to the favourable consideration of the Superintendent General if we wish to do Boarding School work at the place mentioned. I may say that we consider this project not only important but essential.\n\nToronto 1st April 1899\nsometime ago a plan for the proposed boarding school at Norway House was sent to the Department and it was estimated by the Chief Architect that it would cost $12,000 whereas the proposed grant is $3,000. Of course it would be out-of-the-question to build a $12,000 house on a grant of $3,000 and I will be glad to know if the Department will concur in the expenditure of the $3,000 under the inspection of their own agent on a building such as we may be able to erect for that sum leaving it to the future to make any enlargements that may be necessary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to the concluding portion of your letter of the 1st instant I beg to say that the sum of $3000 has been placed in the estimates for 1899-1900 as a re-vote for the enlargement of the Morley school, but it was not found possible to provide a sum for the erection of a Boarding school at Whitefish Lake.\n\nThe sum of $3000 has also been placed in the Estimates for next year as a re-vote towards the erection of a building for Boarding school purposes at Norway House, and in connection with this item I beg to say that as you have already been informed the estimate of the Chief Architect of the Public Works Department of $12000 for the proposed building was based upon the plans and specifications submitted by you, and the sum of $3000 to be provided by the Department is simply a grant to assist in defraying the cost. If your Society does not feel prepared to expend the balance required to put up the building in accordance with these plans and specifications, modified plans to agree with the amount available would\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.\n\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\n\nToronto\nwould be required.\n\nI beg to remind you that schools of the boarding class are all denominational and their existence is, to a very great extent, dependent on outside aid in addition to the Government grant. Such schools to the number of 32 are now in operation, and I cannot at the moment recall any case in which the Department has contributed the full cost of the building, while in many instances it has not been asked for any assistance for this purpose. The cases of the Brandon school and Muncey Institute to which you refer in a previous letter as having been paid for by the Department, have, I submit, no bearing on the boarding school question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of April 12th respecting vote for enlargement of the building at Morley, and for the erection of a building at Norway House.\n\nI have communicated with the Rev Mr McDougall respecting modified plans, and trust that he will give prompt attention to the matter.\n\nI am quite aware that Boarding schools are all, or nearly all, denominational, and we only wonder why it is so exceedingly difficult to get one in connection with the Methodist denomination. To say that there are 32 schools of this class, only one of which is under Methodist control, although we have been pressing our claim for many years, is one of the evidences of discrimination against the Methodist Church of which we have complained. Whether the Department has contributed the full cost of such buildings, in any case, is not the question; we simply take the figures as published from time to time in the Departmental Blue Books, and ask that we receive similar grants to those given in the case of other denominations for a similar class of buildings. I do not understand your reference to the Brandon and Munsey Institutes, as I have no recollection of mentioning these institutions in connection with the question of Boarding schools.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nMemo. Mr McKenna,\n\nAbout a year ago Rev. Dr Sutherland applied for the establishment of three boarding schools, two in the North-West and one in Manitoba at Norway house. The Minister approved of providing for the proposed boarding school at Norway house, and for making the usual per capita grant for 50 pupils. He also decided that the other two schools asked for could not be provided, nor could anything be given for the hospital. Three thousand dollars was placed in the Estimates for last year for the Norway house school and Dr Sutherland was asked to furnish plans. The plans, when supplied, called for an expenditure of about $12000 and a great part of the summer was spent in correspondence on this subject.\n\nDr Sutherland urged that the Government undertake the erection of the building and nothing has been done so far towards commencing operations. The sum granted is to be revoted for next year, and unless something is decided upon immediately, as to who is to put up the building and what it is to cost, I do not see how it is to be completed next year.\n\nDr Sutherland wishes to know if the Department would concur in the expenditure of the money under the inspection of its own Agent on a building such as could be erected for that amount, leaving it to the future to make any enlargements that may be necessary.\n\nIt has not been the practice of the Department...\nDepartment to contribute the whole cost of boarding school buildings, although I do not see that there is any objection to its doing so, if the title is vested in the Government, as boarding schools could in many cases be made quite as serviceable as the so-called industrial schools and at nearly half the cost.\n\nDr Sutherland complains that his Society has been discriminated against in the past in regard to boarding schools, and although there are only two Methodist institutions of this class I do not think that this Department is to blame, as the Society has been slow to take the initiative. The boarding schools now established have, in every instance, been started by the different churches, many of them being the result of the growth of the day schools originally established in connection with the missions. The Methodist Missionary Society has had missions established along the northern portion of Lake Winnipeg for a number of years and if they have not succeeded in establishing a boarding school in that locality I think it was more for want of funds on their part, than from any undue discrimination on the part of the Department.\n\nAs the matter stands now, Dr Sutherland apparently wants the Department to assume the responsibility for putting up the building. Plans, specifications and an estimate will be necessary and I think no time should be lost in obtaining them, either from the Society or from the Department of Public Works.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto,\nOnt.\nFrom the above it will be seen that there is great need at the present time for these two things,- an enlarged school house and an assistant teacher. The Boarding school, I understand, is quite full, and there is no room in that building that could be utilized for school work. The alternative would seem to be an enlargement of the present school building. To provide for the necessary assistance in teaching, we would provide a teacher in connection with the Boarding school; but it would seem to be a needless expense to have two separate buildings for the school work, as all could be accommodated by the enlargement of the present day school building.\n\nTrusting that this will receive the favorable consideration of the Superintendent General,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRecent correspondence from Norway House conveys the impression that there is some misunderstanding at the Winnipeg Indian office respecting school work on the Norway House Reserve. It will be remembered that some two years ago a new school building was erected. When this was done I was given to understand by the Rev Mr McDougall that the school building was put on the present site with a view to the future needs of the Boarding school which was in contemplation; that is, it was our understanding that the Boarding school pupils would be taught in the new school building, leaving the whole of the main building for the accommodation of the Boarding school pupils and staff. It was also our understanding that the ordinary day pupils would be received and taught in the same school building.\n\nThe matter to which I ask special attention is the fact that the attendance at the school has been too large for the capacity of the building, and for one teacher to manage successfully. Mr Lowes, the teacher, informed me that previous to last summer's vacation he had an attendance of over 60 nearly every day, and sometimes over 70. In another letter, dated October 3rd, 1900, he informed me that during the preceding quarter he had 56 Boarding school pupils and 42 day pupils enrolled, and that this was a number entirely too large for him to teach properly.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 13th December, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland applies for a grant to enlarge the present school building at Norway House, which he states is too small to accommodate the boarders and day pupils. The building was built before the boarding house was erected for day school purposes and has accommodation for no more than fifty pupils. The last return received shows that they have forty-six pupils at the boarding school, which is authorized to take up to fifty and they have a day school attendance which reaches to twenty and over. Dr. Sutherland's information is later than that received by the Department and he states that they have fifty-six boarders and forty-two day pupils enrolled with only one teacher. The Church authorities would engage another teacher if additional accommodation were provided. There is no accommodation in the boarding school for class-room work.\n\nThe Department contributed $3000 to assist in erecting the boarding school building, and at the time that it was granted, Dr. Sutherland was advised that no further contribution was to be made by the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant applying for a grant for the purpose of enlarging the present school building at Norway House; and in reply I am directed to say that the Department regrets that it cannot accede to your request, as at the time of its contribution of $3000.00 to assist in erecting the building, you were advised that no further contribution was to be made by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

What we recommended was not the enlargement of the Boarding school (though that may be very necessary in the near future) but the enlargement of the day school building, which was erected before the Boarding school was begun. The attendance at the day school is now considerably beyond the capacity of the building to accommodate comfortably, and there are other children who would attend if there was room for them. We recommend the enlargement of this day school building as the cheapest and easiest way of providing for the children of school age.\n\nPermit me also to say that while it is true that we were advised that $3000 to assist in erecting the Boarding school building would be all that would be allowed, we are unable to see why we should accept this as a final decision. We ask for no special favors; but while we are doing the work that the Department is bound to do in the matter of education, we see no reason why we should be put off with grants very much inferior to those given to other parties doing similar work. As this may have to come before the\nDepartment in the near future, I do not enlarge upon it any further at the present time.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward the quarterly returns of the Norway House Boarding School for the September and December quarter; also Mr. Agent Short's report for March on the Rossville Day School and his report of his last inspection of the Boarding School at Norway House. These documents show a peculiar state of affairs which is intensified by comparing the returns of the Boarding School and those of the Rossville Day School for September and December quarters forwarded to the Department on the 11th instant.\n\nI had had an inkling of the facts some months ago but as the returns were not received there was no necessity to call the attention of the Department just then.\n\nAll the children of the Boarding school get their class training at the Day School and are shown on the returns of that school and the teacher, I presume is paid accordingly. On the other hand the building at the Boarding School is too small to allow of any kind of a room for class purposes. It should more properly be called a Boarding House than a Boarding School.\n\nThe question is therefore whether, if the Day School is paid for the tuition of the boarders, these should also receive tuition grant at the Boarding School. I understand that $60.00 a year is the grant for the maintenance of the pupils, whilst $12.00 is allowed for tuition. If it is so, I consider it my duty\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nduty to point out that the tuition grant is paid twice for the boarders, and I will leave it to the Department to decide whether this is the proper course to follow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nExtract from Annual report of E.

Mr. Hardiman was greatly in favour of compulsion as provided by law. Unfortunately Section 8 of the Regulations issued in 1894 does not include this institution as a recognized school as per clause 137 of the Indian Act. Therefore strictly speaking, compulsion cannot be enforced legally at this point. The Regulations could of course be amended, but I think the Indian Act itself should first be revised and consolidated.\n\nFurther, even if compulsion could be exercised legally, there is no machinery for the purpose - no magistrate or constable to be found within reasonable distance.\n\nI have not heard of any trouble there since Mr. Hardiman left the school.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThat the Indians take hardly any interest in the education of their children applies to all the reserves more or less, even where the Indians are more advanced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nThe Commissioners of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am going out this Fall as a teacher in the Indian Boarding School at Norway House.

From these figures you will see at a glance that the institutions referred to have been carried on for a number of years at a very heavy loss to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church.\n\nSo far as the Red Deer Institute is concerned, the deficit occurred largely on account of the limited number of pupils in attendance. When the present Principal took charge in 1902, he found supplies at a very low ebb and the equipment in very poor condition, but he thought that his best policy was, first, to give the greater part of his time to securing additional pupils, and this accounts almost entirely for the deficit in 1902-3, as almost the whole amount was expended in travelling expenses. The very large deficit in 1903-4 was incurred in replenish-\ning the plant, with additional teams of horses and bringing a large amount of the land under cultivation; and I think on this point it would be quite legitimate for the Department to ask the Principal for a statement of the various objects on which the expenditure was incurred so that it may be determined if any part of it would properly be chargeable to Capital Account to be provided by the Department.\n\nIn regard to the McDougall Orphanage you will see that the shortage there, which we had to make good, aggregates for the six years nearly twenty thousand dollars, and the greater part of this deficit is owing to the simple impossibility of maintaining a school of the kind on the present per capita grant. You have, I think, in the Department a copy of the report prepared by the Rev. Dr. Woodsworth and the Rev. T. Ferrier showing the amount of outstanding bills on the 30th of June last. You are also aware of the recommendation made by Mr. Ferrier that the Missionary Society pay the balance due to members of the staff on the date above mentioned, and that the Department make a grant to cover the other outstanding accounts. On this point permit me to say that the creditors are pressing very strongly for payment, and it is needful that a settlement be made without delay. I sincerely trust that the Department will accept Mr. Ferrier's recommendation, and even then you will see that\nOur loss has been an enormous one.\n\nAt Norway House the deficit has been less, averaging as you will see a little under two thousand dollars per annum, but the amount has varied considerable in different years. In this case also the deficit arises from the impossibility of maintaining the school on the per capita grant.\n\nTo sum up the whole, you will see that the loss to the Society on the three Institutions covering the respective periods mentioned aggregates nearly forty-one thousand dollars. In the case of similar Institutions, managed by other Societies, where serious deficits have occurred in the past, the usual practice of such Societies or Churches has been to appeal to the Department to recoup the entire amounts thus expended over and above the per capita grant, and in a good many cases (possibly all of them for aught I know), the demand has been met. I am not disposed to urge a claim of that kind, but I do think that the Department might very well bear one-half of the deficiencies that have been incurred. One thing is certain, we cannot proceed further on the present basis, and so far as I am concerned, I would rather abandon these schools altogether than have to provide a large\nannual deficiency out of money which our people have given for a different purpose.\n\nBespeaking prompt and favorable consideration of these matters by the Department, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. Sutterland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent\nGeneral of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, 15th August, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with regard to the financial affairs of the Red Deer Industrial school and the boarding schools at Morley and Norway House; and in reply I beg to say that these matters will be brought to the notice of the Deputy Minister upon his return to Ottawa early next week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.\nGeneral Secretary\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 21st August, 1905\n\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn referring to a conversation had with you a few weeks ago, Rev. Dr Sutherland has forwarded memoranda of income and expenditure in connection with the Norway House boarding school for the five years 1899-1904 inclusive, which show an excess of expenditure over the Government grant of $9736.28.\n\nThis he attributes to the impossibility of maintaining the school on the per capita grant.\n\nDr Sutherland, in summing up the financial condition of this and the other two schools referred to (Red Deer and McDougall Orphanage) says that he thinks that the Department might very well bear one-half of the deficiencies that have been incurred. One thing he says is certain, his Church cannot proceed further on the present basis and so far as he is concerned, he would rather abandon these schools altogether than have to provide a large annual deficiency out of money which has been given for a different purpose.\n\nNorway House boarding school is in receipt of a per capita grant of $72.00 for 50 pupils and there would appear to be no doubt that this amount is wholly inadequate to pay for the maintenance and management of a school in this locality. In fact the boarding school grants are claimed by all the missionary societies carrying on institutions of this class.\nto be much too low and these societies claim that where they have not already incurred a deficit, their resources have been over-taxed to maintain them. It would appear that the time has arrived that these grants should be readjusted and it would be far better to give them a reasonable living allowance than be called upon to pay deficits, which they claim have been incurred through lack of sufficient funds being furnished by the Government for their economical management. These boarding schools have all been started in the first instance by the missionary societies who accepted the conditions offered by the Government and it is for the Department to decide whether they will hold them to this arrangement. If the Department recognizes the right of the Methodist Church to be reimbursed for their outlay over and above the per capita grant, every other missionary society in the Dominion carrying on similar work will make like claims, and it would take at least $100,000.00 to meet their demands.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Department could not refuse to consider the liquidation of the deficit at the Norway House boarding school. So far as I am aware there were no special obligations placed upon the Methodist Church with reference to this school. The Department, therefore, occupies its old position in the matter. If we ever come to a rearrangement of the terms under which these schools are conducted and formulate a definite future policy with reference to schools, and there certainly seems to be likelihood of being able to do this at an early date, there is no doubt that we should have to begin by wiping off all existing deficits, at least so far as they exist by reason of small per capita grant and not owing to mismanagement.\n\nAs there is no question of closing the school as there was in the case of Emmanuel College where the deficit was wiped out the other day, I think we might be content to allow the deficit to grow for a few months until we consider the broad question. The claims of this school as well as the others will then come up for consideration.\n\nOttawa, 4th October, 1905.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, October 14th, 1905.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nDr. Sutherland should be written to and advised that the funds at the disposal of the Department will not permit of the deficit being paid and that the question is still left for further consideration, so that if it is decided to favour payment the sums required can be placed in the Estimates for the coming year.\n\nD.

The Principal explains that this was owing to the failure of the teacher who was engaged to put in an appearance.\n\nThe Department considers that better arrangements should have been made and trusts that it will not occur again.\n\nIt is also noticed in the return of admissions that a pupil was taken in whose age is given as three years. The Department does not consider that a child of this age is entitled to the per capita grant without some very good reasons being furnished for admitting him to the school, and till such information is furnished the grant will be withheld.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I have investigated the charge against Mr. Lousley re Charles Clyne. I find that the boy was dressed in a heavy suit of clothes bought from the H. B. Co. less than five weeks before. He had on a pair of woollen under socks and a heavy pair of shanty socks under a good pair of moccasins. He with others were engaged that morning in carrying water from the lake to the house and had an opportunity to warm himself about every five minutes. There was a small hole in his pants and he went upstairs to change them at the time the matron was examining the dormitory. On turning down his bed clothes she found his bed all wet. He seemed to be too lazy to get up at night to use the urinal. When punished for this he would refrain for some time and then start again until again punished. On turning down the mattress this morning the Matron found three pair of pants and two or three shirts (whether two or three is not clear) which had been stolen from the school supplies. She reported this to the assistant principal, Mr. Bell, who went up and with the regulation rubber strap struck Charles Clyne twice over the clothes. The culprit evidently got angry and ran away to the bush. He slept out in a shanty that night and came back next day with both feet frozen. The staff did what they could for him and let his people know of the condition of the boy. These relations took him home and refused all assistance from the school staff after the first day. The boy will lose the toes on both feet but the blame in my opinion rests with himself.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nTo The Hon. David Laird,\n(sd.) C.C.

I went down to see the boy and found him in a very bad way, and the boy himself told me he was working outside and was very cold only having a thin pair of pants on and he went to put another pair on of his own and for this he was thrashed and was told if he did this again he would be chained up and thrashed and put in prison, so the boy was afraid and ran away and was out all day and night, and this is how he got cold, also where he got thrashed the cold got in and his body began to swell, when I saw him, he is in a very bad way and I don't think he will live. I also think the children are being worked far too hard in the Boarding school, it is very good for the children to be learnt to work, but not so much as they are working them there. I hope that you will kindly enquire into this matter and oblige\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Chief Sinclair,\nNorway House Reserve.\nSir,\n\nOn the 14th February Chief Sinclair, of Norway House, (a copy of whose letter I enclose) reported that a boy named Charlie Clines (or Clyne) was severely thrashed at the school, that he ran away and as a consequence was badly frozen. Mr. Agent Calverley was instructed to investigate and his report of the 9th of April is before me. I send a copy thereof for your information. The matter is a very grave one and to my mind is not disposed of by Mr. Calverley's report.\n\nThere are as all men of experience know very many cases in which the cause of the punishment would have been involuntary and there should be very good reason for attributing it to laziness and therefore deserving of punishment. The result of the punishment is shocking. That a boy should so feel the injustice and severity of his punishment as to run away from school and sleep out in weather so severe that his toes were frozen and he will now lose them, is certainly a most serious matter.\n\nThese schools are supported out of public monies of Canada for the benefit of the Indians and such a result as this must be regarded as offsetting much of the benefit which the public expect to flow from the expenditure in the maintenance of the institution.\n\nI should be pleased if you would make a thorough investigation and report. Your report should show what measures were taken for the treatment of the boy by the school authorities and the Agent, and the extent of the injury which the boy suffers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn acknowledging your letter of the 10th instant respecting the punishment inflicted upon a boy of the Norway House Boarding School, I would say that Mr. Semmens was unable through illness to go to Norway House, and therefore will not for some considerable time be in a position to make the investigation.\n\nI thought it well to send a copy of the papers to Rev. Mr. Ferrier, the Superintendent of Methodist Missions, who was on his way to Norway House, so that the matter might be gone into in the meantime by him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 30, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst., I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in sending a copy of the papers respecting the punishment which was inflicted upon a boy of the Norway House school to the Rev. Mr. Forrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, who was on his way to Norway House, so that he might make enquiries into the matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI inquired into the cause of a pupil of the Boarding school at Norway house having his feet frozen some time last winter.\n\nThe first person I interviewed was the boy himself in the presence of only his mother and an interpreter. I also asked a few questions of his mother and made some inquiries from the Principal of the school, and further requested the boy and his mother that if they had any one else they would like me to hear I would be pleased to do so, but no others came.\n\nThe boy is going about the reserve and appears to be in a fair way for complete recovery as far as his general health is concerned. I examined his feet and found all the toes gone from the right foot and three from his left. The right foot is not yet completely healed, but the left about so.\n\nThe boy's statement was secured by answers to questions I asked of him and is as follows:\n\n\"My name is Charles Cline.\n\nI am about 17 years of age. My Mother says I was born in the year the soldiers were drowned in Lake Winnipeg. I have been a pupil of the Boarding school eight years. I had my feet frozen some time after the New Year. I was in the woods when my feet were frozen. I left the school for the woods because Mr Bell whipped me. He whipped me with a rubber strap. He hit me two times on my seat without my pants on. He whipped me because I stole a pair of pants. The pants I took were my Sunday pants. This was in the morning after cutting wood and before going to school. The pants I had on were torn. Mr Bell did not say he would whip me again. I did not go to school but ran away to the woods. I stayed there all day and one night. I was not cold during the day. The next day I went to Angus Monia's house. I had nothing to eat from the time I left the school until I got to this house. I did not come back to the school because the whipping made me senseless and I did not know...\"\nknow my way back. I knew a little in the morning so found my way to the house. I was whipped before in the school. Mr Bell whipped me when we dug the potatoes. Mr Lousley whipped me last winter. I was doing right all the time I was in the school. There was never any reason to whip me. I told lies sometimes and still lie sometimes. I am not lying now. I stole things at the school sometimes. I stole food but no clothing. I ate the food myself. I wet my bed sometimes twice a week. I was not lazy; it was only when I was a little boy I wet my bed when Mr Bell was in the school. I was before the Indian Agent for running away before this happened. He did nothing to me. He said if I did it again he would put me in a jail. Mr Bell did not say he would put me in a jail nor did Mr Lousley nor did any other at the school. No one ever whipped me at the school but Mr Bell and Mr Lousley. I had to work at school too hard and too long. I had to work from eight to 9 in the forenoon and from 4 to 6 in the evening, and on Saturday from 8 to 12. On Saturday we bathed at 3 o'clock and I had to help get wood after we were bathed. I blame Mr Bell for my frozen feet, and no one else because he whipped me.\"\n\nThe Mothers Statement.\n\n\"I do not blame my son for having his feet frozen. I blame Mr Bell; he whipped my boy when he did not do much that was wrong. I know nothing about it except as I have been told by others.\n\nMr Lousley as treated me and my boy well ever since. He has done all for us that he could do. Do not blame Mr Lousley for any part of the trouble. I have never said so against Mr. Lousley. The school has given me and my boy food ever since his feet were frozen and given my boy some clothing, underwear, socks, moccasins and rubbers.\"\n\nMr. Lousley's Statement.\n\nI read over to Mr. Lousley the boy's statement and asked him if it were not true.\"\n\"It is true in the main but very contradictory.\n\nHe stole a great deal more than he has admitted and on quite a few different occasions.\n\nWhen whipped, he had hidden under his bed clothing, two pair of pants, three shirts, two pair of socks. On another occasion he stole a good suit of clothes and ran away taking a number of camping utensils. He has been one of the most dishonest and untruthful boys of the school.\n\nHe wet his bed when small and quit it for two years but started again this winter and would stop it for weeks at a time after punishment for it. It was on account of the nature of his bed that the stolen articles were discovered.\n\nI never knew Mr. Bell to whip a boy severely and he usually did it under my instructions but he had no instructions on this occasion; had I given instructions or administered the punishment it would have been very much more severe.\n\nThe boy had no good reason for leaving the school. He was well clothed and well fed but whipped more frequently than any other boy. At the time he left his clothing consisted of, one new suit, bought at the H.B.C., two new suits of woollen underwear, two heavy black twilled canton flannel shirts, pair of ordinary hose, pair of over socks, pair of moccasins. His socks were renewed on Saturday. He ran away on Monday a.m. His socks had holes in them when he returned. He had an overcoat but not on at the time. He grabbed his cap and ran.\n\nI sent for his brother to hunt for him but the brother would not come. I was afraid to send othermen for fear he would see them and take to the bush and thus run a chance of being frozen.\"\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(sdg) T. Ferrier.\n\nJ.A.J. McKenna,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th instant, I beg to enclose herewith for your information copy of a report received from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, giving, without comment, the result of his enquiries respecting the punishment which was inflicted upon a boy of the Norway House Boarding School.\n\nI may add that Mr. Inspector Semmens has sufficiently recovered from his recent illness to allow him to undertake a trip to Split Lake, and he will, while passing Norway House, investigate the matter, as previously instructed. I have furnished him with a copy of Mr. Ferrier's report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 13th July last respecting the case of punishment at the Norway House Boarding School, in which you stated that you would await the result of Inspector Semmens' investigation into this matter, I beg to forward a copy of his report, which has been delayed owing to the Inspector's illness and absence at Split Lake.\n\nThe Department has now the facts of this lamentable case before it; and I hope for a pronouncement thereon which will be a guide to the staffs of all our Schools in the matter of corporal punishment. It appears to me that if a boy is incorrigible after one moderate whipping or two, he should be expelled from the school rather than be repeatedly severely punished when it does not prove a restraining discipline.\n\nShall I instruct the Indian Agent at Norway House to supply during the winter food for the lad and his mother which Mr. Semmens recommends?\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter, No. 122/78, of the 3rd of July directing me to investigate the case of Charlie Clyne, a pupil of the Norway House Boarding School, who was whipped and subsequently ran away from School and suffered from cold and hunger.\n\nWith your letter was a copy of a letter from Chief Sinclair, of the Norway House Reserve, relating the facts and asking your intervention, and another from Indian Agent Calverly of Norway House dealing with the case.\n\nI also received your letter of the same number dated the 25th of July, enclosing for my information a report signed by the Rev. Thompson Ferrier of the Brandon Industrial School furnishing evidence taken by him from several persons.\n\nIn reply I beg to submit the following observations, viz:-\n\n(1) I interviewed the Rev. Mr. Lousley, the Principal of the School, at Selkirk on the 26th of July.\n\nHe seemed surprised that the Department should desire any further information on a subject which had already been so well looked into, and expressed the opinion that the circumstances had been very much exaggerated.\n\nHe admitted that he had thrashed this boy a great many\nmany times, indeed more than any other, but contended that the boy deserved all he received as he was the very worst pupil in the School. He was a dirty boy, his statements could not be relied upon, he was a thief, and was generally hard to manage, in fact he was quite undesirable in almost every way.\n\nHe further claimed that at this particular time he had no knowledge of the punishment administered by his assistant, Mr. Bell, and had not delegated to Mr. Bell the right to punish the pupils. However, he asserted that he should have punished the lad had he known the circumstances and might have handled the boy more roughly than did Mr. Bell.\n\nHe said that he had no further information to offer than that already incorporated in Mr. Perrier's report.\n\n(2) On the 28th of August I interviewed Chief Sinclair at his own home in regard to this case, and found him still of the opinion that the boy had been overworked and otherwise harshly treated while at the School. The Chief did not seem to think kindly or speak favorably of the work done at the School. I thought I recognized some personal animus on the part of the Chief toward the Principal.\n\n(3) On the 30th of August I met the boy Charles Clyne at Warren's Landing. He was accompanied by his Mother and by his Uncle and Aunt.\n\nI examined his left foot and found that it had been badly frozen and was still somewhat discolored and swollen.\nswollen. Three toes had fallen off in the course of treatment, leaving only the two smallest intact. The foot is tender, and pains the lad in cool and very warm weather.\n\nThe right foot was in a very much worse condition. All the toes are gone, and the wound at the outer end of the stump has not yet healed, though about six months and a half have passed since the freezing. It requires daily dressing and cleansing. It is inflamed and swollen, and the boy suffers much pain, and can only walk with difficulty.\n\nI also examined the right hand which has completely healed, and found that it is bent at the second joint and cannot be straightened out as the other. All the fingers are inclined inwards from the second joint, and the hand is stiff and comparatively useless.\n\nThere are still marks on the back where the sores reported in the Chief's letter were found, but the back is completely healed and will give no further trouble.\n\nThe pupil's general health is not good. He appears to have weakened from protracted suffering and the continued discharge from the right foot. He appeared to me to be anaemic, disheartened, discouraged.\n\nI was convinced from my interview with the lad that he was not mentally strong and that his will power was correspondingly weak. Although his statements were made with much weeping I considered that allowance must be made for possible over-coloring.\n\nThe testimony offered showed that since the boy\nwas admitted to the School he had been repeatedly whipped, and had been frequently threatened with various punishments if he transgressed again. He says that he lived in a state of constant dread of the lash. In consequence of this he had no interest in his School work and only desired to run away.\n\nHe says that when he left the School he was excited, confused, and indignant, and hardly realized what he was doing. In the darkness of the night which followed, his chattering teeth brought him to his senses, and he made for the nearest house and reached it just in time to escape death.\n\nHe stated that after the accident, assistance both in food and medicine was given by the School authorities, but this kindness had been discontinued. He said he was unable to work and expressed regret that his widowed mother must work for him instead of his working for the support of the family.\n\n(4) Conclusions.\n\nI was forced to the conclusion that the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School is not spending enough time in direct and personal supervision of his charge. He is needed there more frequently than he now visits it. My last inspection report intimated this, and I here repeat it.\n\nBecause he is not about, subordinates are tempted to take matters in their own hands, as Mr. Bell did in this case, and may not always exercise the cool judgment which might reasonably be expected from a Principal.\nPrincipal.\n\nI think that more effort should have been put forth to have found the boy on the day when it was known that he had run away. The only action taken so far as known was to ask a married brother to follow him. For some reasons the brother considered that the boy would return in good time.\n\nIt seems but reasonable that an undesirable such as Charlie Clyne should have had an early dismissal. It is hard to understand if he were as bad as represented why he was retained as a pupil.\n\nThe charge of bed-wetting preferred against the boy may have called for medicine. Perhaps careful medical treatment might have obviated the painful necessity of frequent whippings, and it might have been more in accordance with Christian methods.\n\nNo defence can be offered for stealing. However it would be difficult to prove stealing unless there were a witness. The fact that the goods were in his bed in the School did not necessarily prove that he put them there or that theft was the intention. In justice to the boy it should be said that he denies knowledge of anything being there which did not belong to him as a pupil, but this statement does not establish his innocence.\n\nWherever blame may lie, the fact remains that a most unfortunate circumstance has occurred which is not likely to promote the best interests of the School, and which\nwhich does not properly represent the purpose of the Government of the Dominion of Canada.\n\nMr. Bell, the person who of his own accord administered the punishment which resulted so unfortunately, has left the service of the School and of the Church which controls it.\n\nIt is clear to my mind that the Department must now make arrangements to support the lad and his mother for the ensuing winter, and I recommend that a bag of flour or its equivalent be allowed them each month from November 1st to June 1st next following.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) John Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, September 28, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nOn July 3, 1907, the Indian Commissioner forwarded a communication from Chief Sinclair, of the Norway House reserve, addressed to him, regarding the outcome of punishment inflicted upon a pupil of the Norway House Boarding School, named Charlie Clyne, in consequence of which he ran away and had his feet and hands severely frozen, together with a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Inspector Semmens, directing him to make a thorough investigation and report in regard to the extent and injury suffered by the boy.\n\nMr. Semmens, through illness, was unable to take up this matter at once, but the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Missions, who was on his way to Norway House, was requested to make enquiries into the matter. A copy of his report is attached hereto, from which it will be seen that Mr. Ferrier did not consider that he had any good reason for running away, as the punishment he received was not severe. Mr. Ferrier examined his feet and found all the toes gone from the right foot and three from the left, the right foot not being completely healed at the time he examined him, but the left was about so. This was in July, last. He left the school some time in the early\nearly part of February and was out one night and came back the next day in the condition above stated.\n\nShortly after Mr. Perrier made his report Mr. Semmens held an enquiry into the case and the Commissioner has forwarded a report from that officer, from which it would appear that the boy had been thrashed a great many times previously, but the Principal claimed that he deserved all he received, as he was the worst pupil in the school, being dirty, unreliable, thievish and generally hard to manage, and undesirable in almost every way. He further claimed that on this particular occasion he had no knowledge of the punishment, which was inflicted by his Assistant, Mr. Bell, and that he had not delegated to him the right to punish pupils. However, he asserted that he would have punished the lad, had he known the circumstances, and might have handled him more roughly than did Mr. Bell. Mr. Semmens interviewed the Chief, who was of opinion that the boy had been overworked and otherwise harshly treated while in the school. The Chief did not think much of the work done at the school, but Mr. Semmens thought he recognized some personal animus on the part of the Chief towards the Principal.\n\nMr. Semmens examined the boy and found that he had been badly frozen and that his condition was about as stated by Mr. Perrier. All the toes were gone from the right foot and the stump had not yet healed, although the freezing occurred about six months previous.\nprevious. The stump required daily dressing and cleansing, being badly inflamed and swollen, and the boy suffered much pain and could only walk with difficulty. His right hand, which had been frozen, was completely healed, but all the fingers were inclined inwards from the second joint and the hand was stiff and comparatively useless. We found marks on the back, where the scars reported in the Chief's letter were, but the back is completely healed and will give no further trouble. He states that the boy's health was not good, and he appeared to have weakened from protracted suffering and the continued discharge from the right foot. He considered him anaemic, disheartened and discouraged.\n\nThe opinion that Mr. Semmens formed of this boy was that he was not mentally strong and that his will-power was correspondingly weak and that his statements might possibly be overcolored. Mr. Semmens learned that the boy had been repeatedly whipped and frequently threatened with punishment if he transgressed again. He lived in constant dread of the lash and consequently had no interest in school work and his only desire was to get away. Mr. Semmens in summing up says he was forced to the conclusion that the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School is not spending enough time in direct and personal supervision of his charge, allowing subordinates to take matters into their own hands, as was done in this case. He thinks that more effort should have been made to look for the boy when he ran away.\naway, and that if the boy was as bad as represented he should not have been retained as a pupil.\n\nThe boy is crippled for life and Mr. Semmens says that the Department will now be forced to support the lad and his mother during the ensuing winter, and he recommends that a bag of flour, or its equivalent, be allowed them each month until next June. The Commissioner asks whether he shall instruct the Agent at Norway House to carry out Mr. Semmens's suggestion. He also hopes for a pronouncement regarding this case, which will be a guide to the staffs of all schools in the matter of corporal punishment. He says that it appears to him that if a boy is incorrigible after one or two moderate whippings he should be expelled from the school rather than be severely punished when it does not prove a restraining influence.\n\nI fully agree with the Commissioner in this and would suggest that he be authorized to issue instructions to Principals of boarding and industrial schools on these lines regarding corporal punishment. I also think that the attention of the Methodist Church should be specially called to this case and that they should be told that the Principals of their schools should not allow outside work to interfere with the duties they owe to the schools.\n\nYou will see in another memorandum, of even date, on the Norway House school, that Mr. Semmens says he is disposed to recommend that the school be closed for a year, for the reasons therein stated, and, if his recommendation is carried out, I would suggest that, on its reopening, a new Principal be placed in charge.\nOttawa, October 7th., 1907.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nMr. Pedley decided to approve of your memorandum of 28th September. Funds will be found to maintain the boy referred to in your memorandum and the Commissioner should instruct Agent Calverley to carry out Inspector Semmon's suggestion.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, October 8, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., in further reference to the case of Charlie Clyne, a pupil of the Norway House Boarding School, who, as an outcome of punishment inflicted upon him, ran away in February, last, and had his hands and feet severely frozen, and inclosing a copy of Mr. Inspector Simmons's report on the investigation held by him in regard to the extent and injury suffered by the boy.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department concurs in your opinion, that, if a boy is incorrigible after one or two moderate whippings, he should be expelled from the school rather than be repeatedly severely punished, when it does not prove a restraining discipline; and the Department would like you to issue instructions to principals of boarding and industrial schools on these lines regarding corporal punishment.\n\nIn view of the crippled condition of the boy, the Department approves of Mr. Inspector Simmons's suggestion, that he and his mother should be allowed\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nrations during the ensuing winter and until June 1st next, and you will be good enough to instruct the Agent at Norway House accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAust. Secretary.\nAccording to instructions received from the Department, I beg to submit herewith report of the day schools in this Agency, more particularly those in the out-lying portion of the Agency, which have not, and cannot be regularly inspected under present conditions.\n\nOn the 17th of June I inspected the Black River school. The building itself is in fair condition. It should be, however, painted, but although $200.00 was estimated for general repairs to the various schools in this Agency, I was doubtful in my own mind whether the work accomplished by the school warranted the expenditure. The school was closed, but I had the teacher Mr. Slater call in the children. Six boys and eight girls were present. They were all small, possibly from six to eight or nine years of age, and had made practically no progress in English, except knowing some of their letters, and in mathematics had made practically no progress.\n\nA few general remarks might be made here, which would apply to most of the schools, namely Black River, Hollow Water, Jack Head, Poplar River, Grand Rapids, and Norway House Anglican school. There are two reasons why progress is very slow in these schools. First and greatest the teachers themselves have never learned the method of teaching. If it were possible to have a short model, or normal course for these teachers where they might have two months training in the art of teaching, their efforts would then be far more successful, but without that professional training their efforts though well meant are not effectual. The second reason is that it is very hard to teach an Indian child a foreign language as with few exceptions they are very slow pupils. Added to this irregular attendance, and lack of interest, the result generally speaking is unsatisfactory. Berens River and Fisher River are on\nthe contrary successful schools. At both of these places are qualified teachers with professional training, and as the bands are residents on their reserves most of the time, the attendance is more regular, therefore the pupils are more interested in their school work, and progress is good. The Norway House Methodist day school is between the two extremes. The fact is that the boarding school is situated right close to the day school, and that a large number of the Norway House children attend the boarding school. The attendance of day school is therefore small, but an interchange is made of day school pupils. The advanced day school and boarding school attend the boarding school class room, while the beginners of both boarding school, and day school pupils attend the day school. This to my mind is not to the advantage of the day school pupils, but is advantage to the band, as a whole.\n\nDuring the trip I saw that the lumber and shingles asked for at Berens River were on hand, and urged the Chief to have the work done there as quickly as possible. I also instructed the Methodist Missionary to have the school painted, and glass for the windows bought before navigation closed. The same was done at Poplar River. Fisher River school will require some fixing to the shed, and also to the roof of the school house. Hollow Water school, Black River school and Norway House Anglican school should be painted, if the Department considers it advisable to expend money for that purpose. I would like instructions in that matter.\n\nNorway House boarding school has undoubtedly accomplished much good, but as this does not come under my inspection I have not placed it in the report.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAGENT.\nNorway House, April 7th, 1910.\n\nThe Honorable Frank Pedley,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast Fall a pamphlet was received by the Indian Agent also one by myself setting forth compulsory education for the Indian children. I have heard that the Agent wrote to you about it and received instructions to take no action. Would you be kind enough to let me know if that is your attitude with regard to the contents of that pamphlet?\n\nI have had great difficulty here in securing regular attendance of registered pupils of the Boarding School. Parents will, for the most insignificant reasons, keep their children home after the July Holiday, and when allowed home on account of sickness. At present time there are five of our pupils out of school and have been out all year despite every effort to get them in. Our actual attendance is only forty while our roll calls show fifty three names on the Register. These children are all out simply because of some paltry notion of either the child or its guardian. In none of the cases of these children is there sickness of either child or parents, nor can need of any description be urged as a reason for keeping them home.\n\nNeither is there anything of local circumstances to warrant no action. Of course if the Government's policy all over the Dominion is with regard to this subject, no action, there is no reason to make an exception of Norway House; neither is there any reason apparent to me to justify an exception in the case of Norway House if the Government's policy is to enforce the Order.\n\nThe Indians in all this country between Winnipeg and Hudson's Bay are hunters, fishermen, trappers. During the Summer they reside on the Reserves or near them and in some cases cultivate small gardens and raise cattle. A great deal more of this could be done than is done with great advantage to the Government's wards. But at present scores of families are away in the bush for eight months of the year during their stay on the Reserve there is one months holidays which leaves only three months of school for their children, if they are regular in attendance, but as you may know human nature in child or man cannot take much interest in anything at which it works for three months and follows its own inclinations for the other nine of each year. The Boarding school is here and the children could be left in attendance just as well as not while the parents are away hunting in Winter.\nOf course the fur Companies and all who are under their influence are opposed to the policy of encouraging the Indian to build fixed places of abode in connection with which he is expected to cultivate the ground. This, of course, is to be expected and I am not making any complaint about the conduct of any one here, but simply relating facts which need to be borne in mind when any action is contemplated with regard to the Indian. The motive behind this opposition to settling the Indian on the land is a desire to make business profitable as far as possible and it may even include, to some small extent the welfare of the Indian for the present time but it does not take into consideration in the least his future.\n\nWhat is the extent of my authority over Children of the school while in their Parents homes? Have I authority to bring to school any truant or detained scholars?\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Lonsley\nOttawa, June 20, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th of April last, I beg to say in regard to the Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian Children, a copy of which was sent you last fall, that when the Agent was instructed to take no action reference was simply made to the compulsory clause relating to the attendance at day schools, but where pupils desert from or fail to return to boarding schools they may be enforced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Mr. Shore, our General Secretary, who is now absent from the office, is expected home in about two weeks, when this matter will receive his immediate attention.\n\nWe thank you for the reply and information contained in your letter of April 8th in answer to the enquiry of our General Secretary re a Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nOur attention has been drawn to an item in the \"Toronto Globe\" of April 14th, which states that a bill to amend the Indian Reserves Act had been introduced by the Government, providing that where reserve was located in proximity to a growing city and proved an impediment to that community application might be made to the Court of Exchequer to dispose of the reserve and locate the Indians elsewhere on terms set by the Court. This may be of some interest to us. May we ask you if this would be likely to interfere or have any reference to the reserve near the town of Sarnia? We will appreciate any information relative to this case which you may be able to give us.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssociate Secretary of Foreign Missions.\n\nJ.

Ferrier,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Brother Ferrier,\n\nOur boarding school is gone. Burned to the ground this morning. Started at eleven o'clock. Everybody and nearly everything saved. Some boys clothing and some of the largest stoves and most of the bedsteads lost. Miss DeWolf and Mr. Wildgoose lost everything.\n\nWe are fixing up the hospital for staff and girls and have quartered all boys two by two in the native houses around the point and am intending to get the use of that H. B. Co's building here for boys dormitory and can keep classes going and will be able I think to make things fairly comfortable for all in a few days.............\n\nNorway House, Feby. 27th., 1913.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier, etc. etc.\n\nDear Brother Ferrier,\n\nIt occurred to me today that I had not given you any account of the origin of the fire in my hasty note yesterday. You see the fire broke out at eleven o'clock and I was on the scene until after two fighting the fire, getting out the contents of the school storing it all and getting a place for each child to go for shelter and food. The mail closing at six at the Fort made me somewhat hurried. The fire started in the Northwest room upstairs which had been occupied by Miss DeWolf. On leaving to go to classes she left some wood in the stove and at about eleven o'clock she sent a girl to renew the fire. Inside of ten minutes from that time it was impossible to enter her room on account of the dense smoke filling it. There was no person in that part of the building at the time. Boys all in school with Miss DeWolf and Mr. Chapman, girls and staff that were in the building were all either in the kitchen or the sewing room. Mr. Kerley had gone out to the bush to measure wood. Mr. Wildgoose was just coming up with the horses and a load of wood. The people nearest to the room were in the infirmary, one of our girls and Rebecca Frank. The smoke traversed two rooms and into theirs and burst upon them quite suddenly and they gave the alarm. The big bell was rung.\nat once and we all, as well as neighbors, gathered quickly, but not one of us was able to get into the room to do anything. Miss Armstrong, Mr. Chapman, Mr. Wildgoose, and myself all tackled it in turn but were driven back. We tried to get at it through the window but flames scorched Mr. Wildgoose as he lifted the window. So we closed the rooms as best we could and started getting out the sick people and goods. You will remember that in order to get at the door of the room one had to pass through that narrow dark hall leading from the head of the boys stairs past the room previously occupied by Mr. Bolster. Then we found the door locked and from the first that hall was dense with smoke and one could not breathe in it but had to hold their breath while passing through it and doing anything at the fire. I had run up from here as fast as I could and so could not hold my breath for more than a few seconds at a time.\n\nWe hurried all children outside, took the three sick ones to the nearest native house, and had a crowd of the staff and grown up people throwing out the bedding, clothing and furniture. Then the food stuffs from the pantry, the supplies from the office and the stoves. Meanwhile the children and women were carrying the stuff away from the building to a safe distance. By the time we had the south end cleared the north end had fallen in but we wrenched off doors and cupboards that were nailed to the walls. The flames were now shooting clear across to the ice house and we were cut off from our freshly killed beef. Woodshed with about twenty cord of wood ready for the stove could not be saved.\n\nWe had the animals turned out of the stable and a guard set to prevent it from catching fire and so saved the stable and other building close to it, the root house.\n\nThe wind was very cold and quite a few of us were nipped about the face and hands but none seriously. Myself, Mrs. Loudley, and Mr. Chapman had ears frozen. Mrs. Denny and Mr. Wildgoose had feet bitten.\n\nWe at once started to fix up the vacant hospital building which the Indian agent put at our disposal and also the old store belonging to the H. B. Co. We will be able to put all the boys to sleep in the latter building and also three of the male members of the staff. Here, too, we can store clothing and supplies and do our office work. The kitchen, sewing room, dining room, and girls dormitory will be in the former building. In this way we will be able to keep the school going. The building burned on Wednesday and we will be able to start classes again on Monday, I think.\n\nThis will demonstrate to you at once the absolute necessity of having our main store house separate from the school building. We are still able to go on with the work because of the one fact of having our supplies at a safe distance.\n\n...........\n\nOf the staff Miss DeWolf and Mr. Wildgoose are the heaviest losers. Mr. Chapman and Mr. Keith next. The two former lost everything that they owned in the country except the clothes they wore and as they were at their daily work at the time you will understand that it was not the best that was saved. Miss DeWolf's loss was heavy because it was in her room that the fire started and not one of us succeeded in entering her room before the after the fire was discovered. Mr. Chapman's room was next but he succeeded in hauling out his trunk, but lost nearly everything else. Mr. Wildgoose's room was next and while it was thick with smoke had access to it but hearing the call for workers to clear the boys dormitory which was in most danger he left his own things and never thought of them afterwards. He lost by saving the school property.\nThis is the second big loss sustained by Bro. Wildgoose this winter. In the burning of the Oxford House Mission he lost about two hundred dollars worth of goods which were stored there on their way to God's Lake.\n\nI cannot speak too highly of the efforts of staff and neighbors. All worked to their utmost and obeyed others wonderfully well. The Chief of the band appeared on the scene soon and although he was just recovering from rheumatism he gave himself freely to help look after things and see that the goods were housed and the children cared for.\n\nWe have started classes again to-day, which means only three days loss of time. The girls and staff are quartered fairly comfortably in the building used last winter as a hospital while the boys are still by twos at the native houses close around the mission. We expect to have them all in the Hudson's Bay Company store which the Company kindly put at our disposal within a few days. We will in this way be able to carry on the entire work of the school with but small modifications in some ways occasioned by the cramped nature of our position.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd. J. A/ Lousley.\nOttawa, April 2, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Norway House Boarding giving details as to the destruction of the building by fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRev. Mr. Lonsley of Norway House has been here attending the Conference, and he informs me that great difficulties have been experienced in carrying on the work, so much so that he fears the opening of the school until the new building is completed. When he dismisses them for holidays some of them will cost the management for their keep until the time of their return to the school. The management is not in a position to forego the quarter's per capita grant. The school has cost over $5,000 during the past year over and above the per capita grant. What I would like would be that permission be given by the Department for the dismissal of the pupils until the new school is built and ready for occupancy, and at the same time the Department pay the per capita grant for the pupils that are enrolled at the present time and who are not to be discharged during this coming summer.\n\nLet me have the mind of the Department upon this at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Ferrier\nOttawa, June 27, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in which you state that you are advised by Mr. Lousley, Principal of the Norway House Boarding School, that it is not his intention to re-open the school until the new building is put up and asking that the Department pay the per capita grant for the pupils remaining on the roll.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it is impossible to comply with your request, as under the terms of the agreement for the maintenance and management of this school the per capita grant can only be paid for the actual time the school is in operation. However, the grant will be paid for one month, the usual summer holidays, over and above the June quarters earnings. As you are aware the grant is paid on the quarterly returns, which have to be submitted to the Auditor. As there would be no returns the Auditor would take exception to any payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools, Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Sec. Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs has directed that the Boarding School and Student Dispensary are ready to be forwarded to you and your family is away or not likely to be home till Aug. 7th. What shall I do?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.A. Lansley\nOttawa, July 16, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your postcard of the 3rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that it will not be necessary to hold the quarterly school report for the return of the Indian Agent, but the Department would like to have the report of medical dispensing forwarded through his office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Lousley,\nPrincipal,\nNorway House Boarding School,\nNorway House, Man.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen out at Norway House the question of continuing the work of the day schools and the boarding school was considered very carefully by the Principal, Mr. Lousley, and myself. We concluded that it would be a mistake to allow these children, especially those who are from such places as Oxford House, God's Lake and Island Lake, to return to their homes for a year, so we have arranged for them to be kept in the homes of the people.\n\nMr. Lousley and I went over their needs from the food point of view and made out a list of rations that we thought should be given each week to those keeping the children. The clothing will cost us more than if made in the school, in-as-much as we will have to buy it ready made.\n\nWe are retaining two male officers at a salary of $600 each, one to look after a team of horses, and cattle, secure a stock of wood for the coming year, and attend to all other outside duties. The second man will have his time largely occupied in looking after and distributing these rations as they will be needed from day to day. It will cost the management fully as much, if not more, per pupil, to look after the children in this way than if they were kept in a properly equipped building. This was about the only solution we were able to arrive at as soon as we discovered that it was impossible to complete the new building this year.\n\nThe Quarterly Reports will be sent in as usual by the Principal and I trust that the usual grant will be paid by the Department for the coming year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the arrangements made by you and Mr. Lousley for the care of the children at Norway House and payment will be made upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just returned from Norway House. I enclose you copy of a letter I am sending to your architect, Mr. Matthews.\n\nI trust that the Department will see that the architect is sent up there to decide the exact site that the building shall be built on. I see no other way for a satisfactory solution and there is no one else that will assume the responsibility.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 15th, 1913.\n\nMr. H. Matthews,\nArchitect, Public Works Department,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Matthews,\n\nI tried to reach you by phone when passing through Winnipeg on Monday last on my return from Norway House.\n\nThe site selected for the boarding school presents the problem of blasting rock. My own thought in looking at it is to make the basement as frost proof as possible that at least three feet of rock ought to be blasted out in most of the basement for a proper depth. This of course would depend entirely upon what you make the grade line, but I would not like to see the building go on that site unless it went deeper than what appears to be possible without blasting rock. Should it be decided to build on that without blasting rock a cement wall on the south and west sides some six feet from the building sufficiently high to fill in with earth and using it for a flower bed would overcome the difficulty of frost.\n\nThe old school being burned and the old site clear, if the problem of sewage, drainage for the basement and water supply can be successfully solved, the old site has certainly many advantages. Or, it might be that if the building were placed about 150 yards further North than the old site right in the middle of the potato patch and directly west of the stables the problem might be as easily solved from there as on the old site and removing the objection that the present Principal had to having their playground next to the public road where they have been considerably bothered with men passing to and fro and having an opportunity of conversing with the pupils of the school. If that field were used for the site and play ground the south end of the present play-ground could be utilized for a garden.\n\nMr. Bunn, the Inspector, suggests the ground used for the first time as a garden and situated between the old building belonging to the Hudson Bay Company and the Mission House. To my mind this has two or three serious objections. One is it is too low. Another is there is not sufficient\nplayground room. And another, it would be too close to a number of other buildings in case of fire.\n\nNow that the old building is burned, I would not assume the responsibility of stating where the new building should be built. Mr. Snyder, on behalf of the contractors, would not assume this responsibility. In my judgment, you, being the architect, should decide the spot upon which the new building should be erected. In order to do so it will be absolutely necessary for you to go to Norway House. This is not only my opinion, but it is the opinion of Mr. Snyder and Mr. Little.\n\nCan you inform me as to the whereabouts of Dr. Roche? I saw in the public press before going North that he was to visit the West, but have not noticed anything since my return.\n\nI would like to hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.L.\nT.F.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nOttawa, August 20, 1913.\n\nH.

Original on File 168918-7\n\nAt present there is no duly qualified teacher appointed for this school by the Methodist Church authorities. Assistant Principal Mr. Jones has assumed these duties for the present. I trust that this will be remedied next term, and that a certified teacher will be appointed for the education of the pupils of this school. There are fifty one resident pupils in the school at present.\n\nSgd. J. G. Stewart,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 21, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Stewart in his report on the Norway House Boarding School states that at present there is no duly qualified teacher appointed for this school and that the assistant principal, Mr. Jones, has assumed these duties for the present.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to provide a qualified teacher for this school in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir/-\n\nReplying to your favor of the 21st, No.163918/2, re the teacher for the Boarding School at Norway House, as the Department is aware, we were not sure that the school would be open for work until late in the fall, so we would not engage a teacher until we were sure that we were needing one.\n\nI may say that Mr. Jones, who is assistant Principal is an ordained Minister of the Methodist Church, and quite able to look after the interests of the school-room until mid-summer, when we will see that a teacher is placed in charge.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nTF/JM.\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will remember when I was in your office, I put in a request for the per capita grant for The Norway House Boarding School, being raised from One Hundred to One Hundred and Twenty-five Dollars. I have waited up to the present to see how the accounts will stand for the year. I have before met the present time, accounts amounting to about $10,000 for settlement. These goods have been purchased and sent in to supply the School until next July, over and above this there will be the salary of the staff to pay which will amount to over Four Thousand Dollars. It is true that in some lines, there may be more goods purchased than will actually be needed until next June, but it will take between $14,000 and $15,000 annually for maintenance, with an attendance of eighty pupils. You will see from this that if the Government pay only $8000.00, the balance is more than our Church is willing to assume. I would suggest that this school be placed in the northern class for the following reasons:\n\n1st. All our fuel has to be cut and hauled such a great distance from the school that it costs just about as much for fuel as though we were in the heart of Manitoba.\n\n2nd. The freight. All goods purchased in Winnipeg have three distinct freight rates, first, the local rate from Winnipeg to Selkirk via train, second, from Selkirk to Warren's Landing via boat, and third, from Warren's Landing to Norway House. Putting these rates together, the cost of freighting and transport comes very high.\n\n3rd. Food and Clothing at Norway House. The people have been in close touch with civilization through fishing, freighting, and visitation, consequently they are using food and clothing that is copied largely from the white man's standard, rather than that of the Indian people, and we cannot satisfy them in a school of this kind by feeding and clothing them on what might be called \"native production.\" So a school situated at Norway House has all the disadvantages of being isolated from the base of supply, and has nothing of the advantages of Indian habits and customs to offset the expenditure for maintenance.\nRev.

This will be very satisfactory and on behalf of the Methodist Church, I extend you my sincere thanks for the same.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nTF/JK.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward a report on certain complaints that have been brought to my notice in regard to the children of the Norway House Indian Boarding School. There are quite a few complaints from Indians respecting the clothing of the children, the food given to them, and also that the children are not kept free from vermin.\n\nRegarding the clothing, I examined one set of girl's clothing with Mr. Lousley the principal, which had been sent back by Joseph Papanakis, an Indian belonging to the Norway House Band. I found that the clothing supplied this man's girl was of fairly good quality and would be considered warm; the petticoat was woollen knitted, the dress was made of some half woollen material, the other parts of the clothing were of some kind of flannellette, with the exception of a gingham over apron. A warm jacket of some other kind of material for outdoors was also supplied the girl and a pair of woollen mitts.\n\nThis man Joseph Papanakis was allowed to have his girl home for the week end, to be returned on Monday in time for school, but instead of returning the girl, he sent the clothing back with a message to Mr. Lousley that he was taking his girl out of the school, owing to being poorly clad and infested with vermin. Mr. Lousley then informed me that this man intended to take his girl away and keep her, and also asked me to come and personally examine the clothing sent back, which I did in the presence of Mr. Lousley. I consider that the clothing supplied was quite good enough, and that Papanakis should not have taken the stand he did, without having a personal talk over the objections he had to his girl staying away from the school, with Mr. Lousley.\nTo understand the situation thoroughly, I must tell you that the complainant is a son of the late Revd Edward Papannakis, a life long missionary amongst the people of this district. Joseph Papannakis therefore expects that his children when placed in the school will be better dressed than the other Indian children. Mr Lousley does not wish to encourage this kind of thing, but wishes to treat all the school children upon equal terms in the matter of dress and clothing.\n\nPossibly the man may have objected to his girl having come home in a verminous state, when he had sent her to the school perfectly clean and free from vermin. Mr Lousley acknowledges this. Another man made the same complaint when his boy went home for a night, his mother discovered that he was infested with vermin likewise, and that the mitts he was wearing were very much worn out and not fit for the cold weather. The mitts were brought to my office by the father of the boy and I must say that they were at the last stages of being wearable. Nevertheless, after I had explained to the man how his boy had become verminous, and that Mr Lousley was then having all the children examined and cleaned, this man decided to allow his boy to go back to the school. Regarding the mitts I told him that Mr Lousley would give the boy another pair of mitts, if these were the only ones he had. I told this man that perhaps a little of the blame should be laid to the boy, in not having shown the Assistant Principal or Matron the condition of his mitts, for if they had seen them, they certainly would have seen the boy having proper mitts.\n\nRegarding the complaints about the food, I find that while the children have great expectations as to the amount of different foods they should be fed, I must say that Mr Lousley is giving them good and substantial food, and in sufficient quantities. The menu consists of porridge and bread and butter with tea for breakfast, for dinner, soup, fish or meat, vegetables at times or potatoes, with bread and butter, supper consists of bread and butter and tea, which I think is about as good as can be expected. At times owing to the fish\nbeing frozen when brought to the kitchen, they are cleaned in their frozen state, cut up and cooked without being able to tell whether the fish was sound or not. It was in this way that sometimes the fish that were cooked proved to be unsound and so provoked complaints. Mr. Lousley has rectified this manner of cooking the fish, by having the fish brought in the evening before so as to allow the fish to be thawed sufficiently to tell if they are all right for cooking and eating purposes. The complaints of the bad food are not personal complaints, but seem to be a general topic with the Indians. They must have something to talk about and that is the way I look at it.\n\nThe Revd Mr. Lousley has been Principal of the boarding school for some years now and should know the requirements of the children under his care better than do the children who tell these stories to their parents or to people visiting them.\n\nIn the matter of the vermin infesting the children, I beg to state that it was through no fault of Mr. Lousley's, as the children were being brought into the school daily for a time from all parts of this district, and some of them were in a terrible condition in regard to dirt and vermin. Presumably the children who were clean came in contact with these children, before they were thoroughly free from vermin, gave them to the clean children, and this is how this complaint originated. Mr. Lousley hopes to have this evil remedied as soon as possible by careful examination of each pupil daily and seeing that they are thoroughly free from vermin.\n\nMy particular reason for going into these complaints so fully, against the school authorities by the parents of these children, is, that this man Joseph Papannakis is setting a bad example to other parents or guardians by taking his girl from the school in this offhand manner, and one does not know where it will end, as on the slightest provocation or complaint of\nof the children to their parents or guardians, they will be wanting to take their children away from the school also.\" Was the man justified in his action, taking his girl without first consulting with the principal?\" I know that I can use legal means to have the girl returned to the school, but Mr. Lousley hardly cares to resort to these measures, as it might make matters worse instead of improving matters between the Principal of the school and the Indians. This matter I wish the Department to decide, whether it would be best to take the child back to the school by legal force or let the matter rest. I think perhaps that it would be advisable to allow the girl, for the present, to stay at home, until Mr. Lousley, this man and myself can have a personal interview, and see what can be arranged.\n\nThe girl's name was Maggie Jane Papamakis, her application was forwarded with ten other applications for admission, and has since been approved of, Dept letter No. 165915/10, December 15th, 1914. Her name I presume should be struck off the register if not returned to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 16, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the complaints made by some Norway House Indians in regard to the Methodist boarding school there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say with regard to the case of Joseph Papabakis, who removed his daughter from the school and has refused to send her back, that the Department agrees with you that it would be best to allow the girl to remain home at present until you and Mr. Lousley have a personal interview with her father and try and arrange matters amicably. If after this interview Papanakis is still unwilling to send his daughter back you may proceed against him under the regulations and have her returned to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I was speaking to Mr. Lousley just before he left for Berens River about this case, and he agreed with me that it was better to use all lawful means to have the girl returned to the school, as it might have a bad effect on the other parents and guardians placing their children in school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Agents quarterly report on the Norway House Boarding School for the quarter ended March 31, 1915.\n\nOriginal on File 168918-7\n\nRequirements of Staff.\n\nThe staff of a school of this kind is to my mind the most important part to be considered. Without an efficient staff the school would be merely reduced to the plane of boarding house for indigent children. This, I look upon as not being the intention of the Department, but that the Department expects that the children attending such a school, will receive a capable and useful education necessary to them in after life, so that the children will absorb new ideas and transmit these ideas in a still greater degree to their children coming after them. Thus will education be a benefit and a blessing to them eventually. At present the staff is totally inadequate to the number of children admitted and in residence. Two teachers of good reputation and with a natural aptitude for educating Indians, should be carefully selected by the mission authorities. One of these teachers has been appointed in the person of Rev. Mr. Wright, and if the other selection is like unto the first, then the school would have a very competent teaching staff.\n\nAn assistant matron might also be provided as the matron alone cannot possibly give her best attention to the whole of her manifold duties without the assistance of another capable woman. The supervision of all the dormitories and laundry being too much for one person to give complete satisfaction.\n\nA suitable cook capable of teaching others how to cook should also be selected, many cooks can be hired to cook and yet not be able to impart any information to the young girls, which is one of the best and most important\nparts of their education in schools of this kind. Therefore careful consideration should be given to this branch of the girls education by selecting a competent cook and also give practical ideas of how and in which way cookery should be conducted, above all cleanliness in everything.\n\nA practical handy man should also be engaged, who can be of the greatest benefit to the boys, one who has a knowledge of gardening, tree culture and of laying out garden plots, a knowledge of carpentering, house building as well as boat building. This man would give the education of the boys the most practical benefit that they could derive and be one of the most useful members of the staff belonging to the school.\n\nThis matter of reporting to the members of the staff has been asked for by the principal, and he is of the opinion that the school is very deficient in the matter of a proper and efficient staff to conduct the school. Mr. Lousley would urge the Department to bring this matter before the Mission or Church authorities and urge them to secure such a staff as I have outlined. Without the cooperation of such a staff, Mr. Lousley is inclined to think that the school would retrograde and would do an incalculable amount of harm to the future advancement and prosperity of the school. Many of the pupils have been admitted to the school by the parents asking that an education beyond what has been given to their children previously, will be given their children now, if the school authorities fail to do this by not having an efficient working staff, then the school will be doomed to a miserable failure and the authorities will have themselves to blame for it.\n\nSgd. J. G. Stewart,\nAgent\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the portion of your report of the Norway House Boarding School for the Quarter ending March 31st 1915 regarding school land and property, I beg to enclose for your information a plan of a portion of the Norway House Indian Reserve on which is shown coloured in red, the Boarding School site, consisting of about 40 acres.\n\nThis site has not been surveyed nor have the limits ever been cut out. However as the old school lot was fenced and as those limits or lines at right angles to them are used as limits, there should be no difficulty in ascertaining the approximate boundaries of the lands in question.\n\nWith regard to the strip 100 ft in width, which Mr. Louiseley requests to have added to the 40 acres, which the Indians have consented to allow to be used for the purpose of the Norway House school, I may say that you have not given the exact location of this strip but it is presumed that it is in the vicinity of the day school building.\n\nIt is desirable that the Norway House Band be asked for their consent before this be added to the lands to be used by the Boarding School. If such consent were obtained, this strip of land would then be in a similar position to the rest of the land included in the school site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Stewart Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nto how they should conduct themselves when at play or in school. I trust the Department will bring this matter of having a sufficient and capable staff for the next term before Mr. Ferrier, and until this is done, this school will be very backward, for without a complete and competent staff, they cannot hope to bring out the best there is in these children, also truancy will always have to be contended with.\n\nI inspected the class-room and found it clean and orderly, the school material being fair, but not much discipline was exacted from the pupils. I cannot say that I was very much impressed with what I saw and heard. The assistant principal, Mr. Jones, has done all he can, but the number of children is too large for any one teacher to make a success. I also inspected the boarding school pupils under Miss DeWolf's management. There are 44 pupils under her charge besides about 20 day scholars. This is also far too large a number for Miss DeWolf to attend to, and I would recommend in future, that no more boarding school pupils be allowed to attend the day school. There are two class-rooms for the boarding School and all they want is capable teachers for them. I wish Miss de Wolf to give her whole and undivided attention to her day scholars in the future, if the Department will authorize it. Then the day scholars will have the full benefit of Miss de Wolf's care and attention, and as she is one of the finest and most efficient teachers here, her scholars should turn out to be useful men and women when they grow up.\n\nI cannot report any progress as a whole, some of the pupils but very few, seem to be getting along fairly well while the others remain as they were. The usual routine of studies are followed as closely as possible, the behaviour of the boys is only fair, that of the girls is better.\n\nSgd. J. G. Stewart\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boys and girls when released at recess and at the end of the school day to play, should have a male and a female teacher with them constantly to supervise them in their play hours and not allow them to roam wherever they like. This should be carried out with great strictness by the school authorities as the boys at present are given too much freedom. They go about where they like and in fact do what they like and all this from want of proper supervision. The boys' teacher should be constantly with them. A female teacher or attendant of the school, of which there are none on hand, should be with the girls and organize them into little cheerful groups at different games, but this is not done as there is no one to do it, so the girls have to consider their own ways of amusing themselves, which are far from being appro\n\nAll of this I must state could not be av first term of the school, as no staff had been than was available for the time, the school I suppose being backward to go to any expense were sufficient pupils in the school to warrant staff.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSince this boy has been admitted to the school, he has given a great deal of trouble by continually escaping from the school through various ruses. He has broken out of dormitories, play-rooms, has escaped from boys who had him tied with rope. The last time he was brought to the school a few days ago by his father, I mentioned to the father that it was impossible to keep his boy, unless he was tied up in some manner. To this he objected. The father then took the boy to the school, had his dinner and after dinner reported by his father as missing, fortunately his father caught him before he had gone very far. The boy was then placed in school until four o'clock, and at five he was away again and has not yet returned. What should be done with this boy? It seems impossible to keep him, yet the school authorities don't like to admit defeat. The boy is considered by some people to be wanting in the upper weeks. Miss DeWolf, his teacher, considers he is quite a bright boy and thinks nothing is wrong with the boy, except that he finds school life irksome, \"a true savage of the wilds\" I have seen the boy several times, and I would say that there is nothing in his appearance to denote that he is mentally unbalanced, he looks to be rather the opposite. Dr. Norquay has pronounced him fit, physically, and he looks it. I think that the boy cannot stand restraint or wont,(perhaps it is the better word) as he is that way at home, and if very annoyed takes himself with his bow and arrow to the bush and there stays away for two or three days at a time giving his parents great anxiety when he does this. Now the best and most logical reasons of his frequent escapes is that the school is understaffed. These boys and girls when let out of school to play have practically no one outside to supervise them, this being the case it is a wonder that there are not more\nMONTHLY REPORT OF THE NORWAY HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL\nAPRIL 30, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of April, 1915, on the Indian Boarding School at Roseville, Norway House Agency.\n\nI duly inspected the building and found that it was kept clean and orderly.

I would recommend that no more than that number be admitted as perhaps that is too many. Mr. Lousley would then require permission from the Department to recruit up to that number. Altogether there are 87 pupils who are resident. When all assembled Mr. Lousley would require only two more boys and 11 girls to make up the required 100 pupils, as per list attached to report.\n\nIf allowed by the Department to keep up this number, then Mr. Lousley should be permitted to recruit when discharges or deaths take place, so as to keep the school at full strength.\n\nx x x x\n\nREGARDING FREDERICK HALCRO #100.\n\nThis is the boy marked absent as an \"escaped\".\n\nSince.\nOttawa, June 5, 1915.\n\nRev.

Perhaps gentler treatment might have a more salutary effect and it might be well to try it in this case.\n\nMr. Agent Stewart's remarks as to the lack of supervision given to the pupils should receive your careful attention.\n\nYou will also notice that Mr. Stewart claims that the teacher of the day school has more pupils than she can properly accommodate, owing to the boarding school pupils attending the day school.

Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOf Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont., 480168\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of April 24th. re deficiency of management in the Norway House Boarding School with respect to the training of boys in manual work and gardening operations reached me yesterday. In reply allow me to say that your informant must be either very ignorant of the conditions or malicious in his designs because of the following facts. We have not one square acre of ground available for gardening purposes. We have not up to date been given possession of one square foot of land except the old school site and right in the middle of our largest garden which pertained to the old school the new school was placed so that we have from one quarter to one half of an acre left in the smaller old garden.\n\nI have repeatedly drawn the attention of your Agents here and Rev. T. Ferrier, the Superintendent of Indian Education of the Methodist Church to these things and urged immediate action but without avail. When Mr. Mclean, your Surveyor, was here about five years ago enlarging this Reserve I appealed to your Agent then to get it settled and surveyed for me. I also urged Mr. Ferrier specially at that time to have it put through and appeal to Mr. Mclean but nothing was done. When the new school was to be built the Indians agreed to give forty acres for our use but no marks were set, no boundaries given and I appealed to your Agents to locate this land or give me map or drawings by which I could locate it but without avail. But even had I been able to locate this land it is all either bush or unbroken sod and unfenced and so unusable till such time as it can be cleared, fenced and broken up. This, I assure you will be done and in the shortest order possible when the Department provide me\nSecondly we, since the old school burned down, have not had any boys available for work till last October when it was too late to do any work in the garden line and as it is only two weeks ago now that we could do anything in the gardens this Spring you will see that when your informant wrote you we had not yet had the slightest chance to do anything in this way.\n\nThen as to doing carpentering or other such work we have no Carpenter Shop, No carpenter, to instruct the boys, and up to this Spring we have had no work for them to do.\n\nSo from these facts you will see that ignorance of a culpable sort, malice or that which inspires a child to babble has been the moving power of your informant.\n\nI assure you, Sir, that I am glad to have this opportunity of bringing our needs in these directions to your notice believing from the substance and tone of your letter that you will see to it that we receive the much needed and long desired facilities for carrying on these branches of our work. I assure you that I am heart and soul in sympathy with your ideas as expressed in your letter.\n\nI received on same mail as your letter one from Mr. Ferrier informing me that a grant had been made for improvements at last session and as I had sent in a request for a Carpenters Shop I presume we will have one in the near future and we will be able to realize part of our cherished plans for the education and advancement of these people.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Navigation closed before the school was really opened. I hope that all these matters can be adjusted satisfactorily for the coming year's work.\n\nAs to the number of pupils, I discussed this when I was in the Department with Mr. Scott. It came up in connection with Mr. Lonsley's request to have the school enlarged to hold 160 pupils. He stated that he had already an attendance of 90 and could accommodate 100 by using a room on the top flat for a dormitory for small children. This number of pupils could be easily reached by the number of applications he had before him. As I understood it, the arrangement between Mr. Scott and myself was that the number was to be 100. In harmony with this arrangement I notified Mr. Lonsley that he would be safe in recruiting up to 100 but not beyond that number. Your letter is not clear as to whether 80, 87 or 100 is to be the limit. If it is the latter, it is quite satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nT.F./ M.O.R.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since receiving your letter I have had one or two conversations with Mr. Louieley, the Principal on this subject. Mr. Louieley has always been able to give the boys enough manual work in the shape of doing all the chores, and in the spring time by working in the garden, which I may say is very limited at present, and not large enough for a school of this size. This is partly the fault of the Indians, who could give a splendid piece of ground suitable for a large garden for the school, but which they have recently refused to do.\n\nIn other instructive labours such as carpentry, boat building, shoemaking, and a few other trades adaptable to this country, Mr. Louieley has been very much handicapped through the lack of funds, and not knowing last fall just how quickly scholars could be got for the school, in this Mr. Louieley was more than successful, as parents who saw the fine school built by the Government, were eager to get their children in as soon as possible, and lack of funds and suitable clothing and sufficient food of different varieties, were hard to supply as the school authorities had made no preparations for so large many pupils coming in at once, but happily Mr. Louieley was able to surmount these difficulties in a very capable manner.\n\nNow that there is an opportunity of money to be spent on improvements, Mr. Louieley is of the opinion that it should be used to take advantage in a manner for the boys of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\nschool, and one in which I could most sincerely recommend.\n\nIt is true; I understand the Department has set apart a certain sum of money for improvements to the school, such as I mentioned in my last quarterly report; stables, wood shed and carpenter shop, ice house and fence, fencing school property, etc., Mr. Lonsley is asking the Department to allow the school to do these improvements with Mr. Jones to assist and oversee the boys' work, of course there will be some practical men besides to help in the work, and have it finished as soon as possible. Mr. Lonsley is of the opinion that this work could be done more advantageously by day labour here and incidentally cheaper than by tender or contract from outsiders.\n\nI am also of the opinion that this can be done by Mr. Lonsley and Mr. Jones who is a practical carpenter and overseer. He is the gentleman that built the Brandon school barns and which have been pronounced by experts to be as good as any built in either Canada or the United States.\n\nNow it is work of this kind that will be beneficial to the school boys, as they will be taking their part in assisting to put up these buildings, and do the other work besides. I think that the Department should do this for the school as I think that Mr. Jones can do it successfully and also establish a desire amongst the older pupils to become tradesmen and so begin to learn the carpentering trade, by assisting in the erection of whatever buildings are going to be erected. Mr. Lonsley has also asked me to say that he thinks Mr. Jones could also build the reservoirs and improve the grounds so that no expense will be called for in the winter months, such as last winter. I can certainly recommend this, as I know that we would get good and conscientious work, and have it done right at once, instead of having to add expenses and repairs to outside contractors work, which was the cause of our trouble last winter and which I have to go into with the Department more fully, as the Department regulates the amount of fixing the sewers last winter and virtually wish me to pay it.\nI have the Honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Stewart\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOntario.\nNorway House, Manitoba, June 14th, 1915.\n\nThe Sec. Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand from Mr. Perrier that a certain sum of money has been voted by the Government for improvements and repairs for this school this year. Will you be good enough to allow us to do the work here instead of by letting it by contract? I have a first class man here who is willing to take charge of it in the person of Mr. Jones who has had experience in Brandon School and of whom you know something in that connection. Further this will enable me to give our boys a fine training in building and general Carpentering work which would be invaluable to the boys and to the people. We will employ our boys to do every bit of the work possible and in this way will get nearly twice as much work accomplished for the same outlay that could be accomplished by letting the work by contract. This need has been the subject of a recent communication from you and my reply pointed out that up to date no work of this kind was possible. It is now possible if you will allow us to do the work planned. Mr. Jones has drawn up plans and estimates for the several buildings needed and I am taking them into Winnipeg with me and will consult Mr. Ferried about them and no doubt he will communicate with you at once.\n\nMr. Jones could also undertake the work necessary to complete the water supply which was not complete.\nlast year. And I would most earnestly urge that a well be bored rather than a reservoir and filtering plant put in. The septic Tank is far too small and the outlet from it was not put below frost line and it is going to be a costly bit of work to get it into shape as it will require a lot of blasting under water to get the outlet out into the lake below frost line and there is no other solution for the problem from the present site of the school.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply,\n\nI am Yours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal of Boarding School.\nOttawa, July 2, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 14th ultimo in reference to the number of pupils to be admitted to the Norway House Boarding School I beg to say that eighty is all that are provided for and this number must not be exceeded.\n\nThe Department is not in favour of using a room on the top flat for a dormitory.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of communications from Mr. Agent Stewart and the Principal of this school in reference to certain matters in connection with this institution, copies of which are enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Mr. Perrier is being written to in regard to the matters referred to in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Stewart, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, July 2, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo in reference to certain matters in connection with the Norway House Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. Mr. Ferrier is being written to in regard to the matters referred to in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Lousley,\nPrincipal,\nNorway House Boarding School,\nNorway House, Man.\nTo The Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of the 2nd instant, re the accommodation at the Norway House Boarding School, when I was at Norway House I went into this matter carefully. Dr. Grain also accompanied me and can give you any further information necessary.\n\nThe accommodation in the building, commencing with the top flat is as follows:- Two large dormitories with a wardrobe off of each, bath-rooms and wash-rooms, and also a large store-room and 6 private rooms. The flat is occupied by the boys and the men of the staff. The dormitories are large and well ventilated. Each will accommodate 35. These dormitories can be extended in summer or mild weather by using the balcony, which is screened in and protected from the rest of the building. There is a private room in connection with each dormitory where 3 boys can roam in each. This still leaves 4 rooms for the men of the staff. This gives ample accommodation for 56 boys and 4 men of the staff.\n\nThe middle flat has 1 private rooms for the Staff, 2 large dormitories with a wardrobe off of each for the girls, a large sewing-room, Staff dining-room and also bath and wash-rooms. The dormitories can be extended by using the balcony, which is screened in and protected from the roof of the building. This flat is used by the girls and the lady members of the Staff. There is ample accommodation for 4 ladies and 50 girls.\n\nThe ground floor has 2 offices, reception room, girls' play-room, children's dining-room, kitchen and pantries. The classroom has 44 double seats providing comfortable desk-room for 88 children. By putting forms and chairs for special gatherings it will seat about 126 people. The dining-room will seat 110 pupils.\n\nThe building has first class plumbing, and when the water system is completed it will be up-to-date. The ventilation throughout is excellent, and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the building will accommodate 106 pupils and 6 or 7 of a Staff. If you wish any further information in this matter, you can get it from Dr. Grain.\nOn my last visit to Ottawa, it was understood between Mr. Scott and myself that the grant was to be put on the basis of $125 per pupil up to 100 pupils. In harmony with this I instructed Mr. Lonsley, the Principal to take in children up to 100. He informs me that the average attendance for the Quarter was 85, and he expects to open the school after vacation with at least 100 children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.C.B.\nMENU OF NORWAY HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL 1915.\n\nBREAKFASTS:\n\nPorridge made of Rolled Oats or Wheat Granules is served six mornings a week. Rolled Oats four, Granules twice. Each plate is served with a liberal serving and extra large vegetable dishes placed on the tables so that those who wish can replenish their plates. Syrup is served with the porridge, or sometimes yellow sugar. Monday Mornings we serve Boston Baked Beans instead of porridge. That is we bake beans with bacon cut into squares plentifully mixed with them. No limit is placed to the amount of bread the children want to eat. For bread making we have used all Glenora Patent Flour. Tea sweetened with sugar is given for drink.\n\nDINNERS:\n\nAre composed of fish, potatoes, Beef, Moose Meat, venison, Split Peas, Pot Barley, Rice, and bread with water to drink. For about nine months of the year we have all the first class White Fish we can use. At other times we have any quantity of Pike, Pickerel, Gold Eyes, Suckers, and Sturgeon. Occasional meals of wild ducks or Geese. When fish is served we cook on an average one lb. per child per day. When meat of any kind is served we cook as nearly as possible half a lb. per child and boil with it one of the above named dried vegetables. The quantity of bread is not limited at any of the three meals of the day. Sundays dinner is of Baked Boston Beans in place of fish or meat and has apple pie for desert.\n\nSUPPERS:\n\nWhen fish is plentiful three suppers each week are of fish and bread. The other three, and when fish are scarce for five days per week the suppers are of stewed apples, Prunes, or Figs or Syrup with unlimited quantity of bread.\nSaturday evenings butter is served and Sunday Jam instead of fruit or fish. Sweetened tea is given for drink.\n\nNote: - we have ninety two children on the Roll with an average age of 10.22 yrs.\n\nWe use six hundred and twenty five lbs. of flour per week. And ten lbs. of lard is provided per week, but as the fish are very fat the full quantity is not used when fish are plentiful but more is used when fish are scarce.\n\nJ. C. Farsley.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of June 5th, #16918-1, re Frederick Malero, pupil #100, I make enquiry about this boy and also regarding truants of the School. I find that this boy is about the only pupil that is given to truancy. During the past year there were 2 boys that left the school for one day and were brought back the next, but he is the only boy that has the habit of playing truant. It appears that this boy had been in the habit of running away from home as well as from school and cannot be trusted. A small chain was put on him in order that another boy might hold him. This was the only time this was done, and it was during the time that the ice was rotten in the bay and they were afraid that his foolishness might lead him to run away over the ice, and thus lose his life. They concluded that this was the best way to treat the boy for the time being in order to secure his own safety.\n\nThe statement that Mr. Stewart makes regarding the lack of supervision over the pupils there, I think that claim is without foundation. The girls are never allowed out without some officer being responsible for them. As far as the boys are concerned this is not a necessity, and the implication in Mr. Stewart's report is that, because of this, the boys and girls are running away from the school. As you will see, such is not the case.\n\nI note also what you say regarding the pupils attending the day schools, and the necessity of putting in another teacher. A second teacher is being arranged for during the coming fall. In order to justify this, the maximum number of pupils must be at least 100.\n\nI do not think it necessary for me to go into further detail in this report beyond this, that, to my mind, the policy of receiving reports from Government officials who have absolutely no experience in managing these schools, and putting reliance upon them, is absurd. While these officials may be able to do their work satisfactory to the Government, they would inevitably fail in the managing of an Industrial or Boarding School. I do not mean to imply that the management of the Norway House Boarding School is beyond criticism, but the prospects of opening the school last fall were somewhat...\nproblematic until late in the season when navigation was about closed. The staff was hardly sufficient during the whole term and there were many extra duties. This will be remedied in the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.C.R.\n## Dietary of the Norway House Boarding School\n\n| Day       | Morning | Noon     | Night    |\n|-----------|---------|----------|----------|\n|           | Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n| Sunday    | Granules Porridge, Bread & Tea | Pork & Beans, Pie, Bread & Water | Bread & Jam, Tea |\n| Monday    | Baked Beans, Bread & Tea | Fish or Meat, Bread & Water | Fish & Bread, Tea |\n| Tuesday   | Oatmeal Porridge, Bread & Tea | Fish or Meat & Rice, Bread & Water | Prunes & Bread, Tea |\n| Wednesday | Granules Porridge, Bread & Tea | Fish or Meat, Split Peas, Bread & Water | Fish Bread & Tea |\n| Thursday  | Oatmeal Porridge, Bread & Tea | Fish or Meat, Pot Barley, Bread & Water | Apples & Bread, Tea |\n| Friday    | Oatmeal Porridge, Bread & Tea | Fish or Meat, Bread & Water | Fish, Bread & Tea |\n| Saturday  | Oatmeal Porridge, Bread & Tea | Fish, Bread & Water | Bread & Butter, Tea |\n\nThe Fish or Meat is to be boiled with some of the dried vegetables mentioned above.\n\nPies are made once a week, 1 lb Lard to a making, pie cuts in 6 pieces.\n\nFor a change the Fish or Meat may be fried or roasted.\n\nYellow sugar to be used in tea, night and morning, also in stewing apples or making pies.\n\nYellow Sugar, with syrup every alternate morning, served on Porridge.\n\nWhen fish or meat is not in stock, dried vegetables &c., as the Principal may direct, may be used.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The above is a copy of the Dietary posted in the kitchen for the guidance of the cook, in the preparation of the meals for the children of the Norway House Indian Boarding School.\n\n**Fish:** These are White, Pickerel, Pike, Gold Eyes, Sturgeon, Red and Grey Suckers.\n\n**Meat:** This is Beef, Moose Meat, Venison.\n\n**Vegetables:** Beans, Split Peas (dried)\n\n**Cereals:** Rolled Oats, Granules, Pot Barley, Rice.\nBreakfasts.

Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 2nd of June last, I beg now to submit copies of the dietary of the Norway House Indian Boarding School, in response to your request therefore. You will note that there is copy marked \"A\" and a copy marked \"B\", in this connection I offer the following explanations.\n\nThe copy marked \"A\", is a true copy of the dietary posted in the kitchen of the school, for the guidance of the cook, in the preparation of the meals for the pupils of the institution. It was compiled by the assistant Principal, the Rev H.T. Wright, and is systematized and put in order by him, he got the information to do this from the copy \"B\".\n\nThe copy marked \"B\" was prepared by the Principal, the Rev J.A. Leusley, in connection with a reply to an enquiry, from you I think, with reference to the dietary of the school.\n\nDuring the past summer, since I arrived in the Norway House Agency, and once or twice outside of it, I have listened to a number of complaints from Indians about the food given to the children in the school at Norway House, one has to be careful in accepting such complaints, as the complaints often lack proper and sufficient cause, however I always\nalways note such complaints, they are a guide in enquiry; I have investigated this and I have arrived at the conclusion that there have been some grounds for the Indians to complain as they have done.\n\nDr Morquay has informed me that he has had a number of the children from the school brought to the hospital for treatment, and in very many of the cases, he noted that when he had them under observation to locate their trouble, or the cause of trouble, he usually found low physical conditions, and that these conditions soon improved, and in a large measure disappeared, when they received proper nourishing food in the hospital; from this I think it can be fairly deduced that the prime cause of trouble was lack of proper nourishing food, implemented also by a physical predisposition to tubercular troubles in the person being treated, which would cause the health conditions to be sensitive and easily affected, by the conditions I have mentioned.\n\nI talked over this matter fully with the Principal and plainly told him, in a courteous manner, that there was a complaint, he courted the fullest investigation, what I pointed out was the absence of a sufficient quantity of fatty foods, and such food as would put the children in good physical condition to resist disease. The quality of the Bread is open to criticism, I saw it on the table, it was not well cooked, the fleur may be all right, but in handling the dough and converting it into bread, there is not the proper measure of success to produce good bread, what I saw was heavy, and I would think not readily digestible, the fish I saw, was cooked all right, I have been informed that this is not always the case, and that the fish have not been of prime quality, this I put before the principal, and he emphatically denied it. In matter of vegetables, the principal admitted that they had only a limited quantity, that they could not yet by their own\nown effort grew sufficient vegetables to freely furnish the pupils this feed in liberal quantity; he informed me that last season he gave only 2 meals a week of potatoes, up to the end of January 1915, and in February and March only one meal a week, and after that, up to the time of my enquiry, practically none had been supplied for food, in addition to a meagre supply of potatoes there were a few turnips, beets estimated and cabbage and carrots. The crop of potatoes for this year will be about 200 bushels, the principal informed me, and this would be amended by some turnips, carrots, beets and cabbage, and that he intended to secure by purchase all that he could, this however is not very satisfactory, and the school should certainly bend every effort to raise all the vegetables they require. After next spring there should not be any lack of this essential in the dietary of this institution, I intimated this to the Principal.\n\nTo more effectively supervise and confirm the dietary of this institution, I would suggest that the Doctor should be instructed to inspect the food supplied, from time to time, at regular intervals, say twice a month or oftener, and that he should verify the dietary at every inspection. This inspection would be a protection to all concerned, the food supplied would be kept up to a proper standard and such action would properly and readily combat unfair complaint.\n\nI have noted in a feet note on copy of dietary marked \"B\", that intimates that 10 lbs of lard is provided weekly, I submit that it should not only be provided, but that it should be used, it could be used by being spread on bread, if it is good pure lard, it should be a splendid food for the growing children, in the way I mention, it would take the place of Butter. Used both Ruth's Lard could be used.\n\nThe beef supplied in the winter of 1914-1915, was about two ordinary carcasses, this was not very liberal in quantity,\nin quantity, the quality was fair the Principal assured me, for the coming winter of 1915-1916, he informed me he had on hand four head of beef cattle for killing to supply beef; the formula for the preparation of Boston Baked Beans, was 8 lb Bacon to 60 lb of Beans. I told the principal that I was of the opinion that he should use more Bacon, and supply this feed oftener; and if possible, he should not furnish for the food of the children, any of the fish known as \"Suckers\", they are a poor food, particularly the \"Grey Sucker\", the giving of these fish to the children was complained about by the Indian people. In preparing Fish for food, it would be well to have them cooked by frying, at least once a week. More attention should be given to having the bread well baked, this I understand was being arranged, as there was to be a change in the cook, one who could handle the work to better advantage and with better results. This was a needed change.\n\nI have endeavored to get all the facts I could for your information, and I trust I have been able to give you some good and proper data.\n\nI might also add that I showed the dietary to Dr. Grain, he expressed the opinion that he considered it rather light, he also thought it would be an advantage to cut out tea as a drink in the evening, and get some suitable substitute.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosures.\nExtract from Agent's Monthly Report on the Norway House Methodist Boarding School for the month of October, 1915.\n\nOriginal on 168918-7.\n\nThe Principal has as yet been unable to secure an engineer to attend the furnace and electric light plant. This lack of assistance entails extra work on Mr. Wright, and as a result he is not able to put his full energies into the class-room work.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Jones, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of No. I68918/I, dated Jan. 15th, I beg to state that up to date, no engineer has been sent to the Norway House boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 11, 1916:\n\nSir,\n\nSometime ago Mr. Agent Jones called the Department's attention to the fact that he had been informed by the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School that he was unable to secure an engineer to attend to the furnace and electric light plant and that this lack of assistance entailed extra work on Mr. Wright and as a result he was not able to put his full energies into the class-room work. Mr. Jones stated that he was informed by the Principal that he had written to you to send out an engineer as early as possible. Mr. Jones again writes the Department to the effect that up to the present time no engineer has arrived.\n\nThe Department would be pleased if you would give this matter your attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSeptember 30th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Bunn -\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with two enclosures, reporting on the dietary at the Norway House Boarding School.\n\nI approve of your suggestion that the Doctor should be instructed to inspect the food supplied from time to time, and I would ask you to be good enough to communicate with him stating that it is the wish of the Department that he should do so. You should also ask Mr. Jones to make a regular inspection and deal with this matter in his monthly reports.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOctober 1st, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nI have just received through Mr. Inspector Bunn a report on the dietary of the Norway House Indian Boarding School. From this report it would appear that Mr. Bunn has gone very fully into the matter with the Principal, Rev. Mr. Leusley, and if Mr. Bunn's instructions and suggestions are carried out by the Principal I am sure there will be an improvement in this feature of the management of the school. Mr. Bunn has suggested that Dr. Morquay be instructed to inspect the food supplied from time to time at regular intervals, and I have approved of this suggestion and given instructions accordingly. I have also asked Mr. Jones to make note of the dietary and report after each of his monthly inspections. From Mr. Bunn's report there would not appear to be any doubt that there is room for improvement in the quality, quantity and variety of the food furnished the children in this institution, and I hope that in future there will be no grounds for complaint.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Lousley,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of Jan 16th, last, to hand.\n\nIn reply I have to say, I am glad I shall eventually be tried by a higher judge than yourself, and that as far as my conduct in regard to school children has been antagonistic to your institutions, both at Brandon and Norway House, I meet the coming of such judgement with infinite confidence.\n\nThe good taste of your letter is to my mind very doubtful.\n\nI shall however ask my Agent's advice before taking it further.\n\nAlso I await, if possible his coming to frame my charge against your school management and ministry generally, for the information of your conference and the Department at Ottawa.\n\nyours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Jacob Berens,\n\nChief.\nNorway House,\nJan 16th, 1916.\n\nDear Friend,\n\nYour Grandson reached here alright on Thursday. He was well but his cheeks had been touched with the frost. The most of each cheek had been touched but nowhere deeply. There was only one spot that was sore and that only slightly, so you know the frost bight was not at all serious. Of course you must not blame me for this, but yourself, for had you sent him back when you should have this would not have happened. I received your note saying you sent him back under protest, well, I am sorry that a man in your position and at your age and with your reputation for integrity and uprightness should be so long becoming reconciled to the right.\n\nYou must know dear brother that God cannot be pleased with the way you have acted about these children. I pray that God may pardon you and let you know your mistake before He calls you away from this earth. You have long hindered the children of your people from attending these great schools that God has provided for your people and you ought to ask God to forgive you before you go into His presence for it would be a fearful thing for you to go into the presence of an offended God. So I, one of the men God has sent to your people in this North Land call you to repent of this your wrong doing before it is too late.\n\nWith prayers for your temporal and eternal blessing\n\nI am yours in Christ,\n\n(Signed) J.A. Lousley.\nBeren's River  \nJan 12th, 1916.\n\nJ.R.Bunn, Esqr.,  \nInspector of Indian Agencies,  \nWinnipeg.\n\nSir,\n\nLast fall when I saw you relative to the children of this band who were truants from the Norway House Boarding school, I agreed to use my influence with the parents of the children so as to insure their return to the school. This I did and the children were sent. I understood you that I might keep my grandson Joseph as I had found, at my advanced age I really could not do without him.\n\nI was much surprised the other day by the arrival here of a mounted policeman with a warrant issued by Dr Norquay, Police Magistrate, for Joseph. I do not know what happened after you went to Norway House, but I believe if you found it impossible to accede to my request in face of the hostile attitude of Mr Lousley, you would have at-once advised and saved me the indignity I have been subjected to. I am hopeful I shall hear that the Indian Agent at Norway House has exceeded his authority in swerving out an information against me.\n\nIt is true I made an agreement making over the guardian-ship of the boy to the boarding school, but consider myself absolved from that agreement by reason of breach of contract on the part of Mr Lousley in the way, I am, I believe, creditably informed, he failed to see that the children were properly fed and other matters.\n\nKindly let me hear from you,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Jacob Berens.\n\nP.S.\n\nI am at a loss to know understand, after 40 years of faithful service to the Government what charge can have been made against me that I have been treated in such a manner. You will confer a favour by advising as soon as possible exactly what Mr Lousley has to say when I will confer further with you. J.B.\nNorway House, Man Sept 28th, 1915.\n\nMr T.H.Carter,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr Carter,\n\nSoon after writing you Mr Bunn came along and a little later Mr Stewart, and as Policeman was on his way out we sent him after the Beren's River children.\n\nThey are all back but two. One of those is sick the other is the Chief's Grandson and is needed at home so was allowed to stay.\n\nAt Poplar River we left to get by dog train as boat does not call there. The Chief's complaints were laid before Inspector Bunn and also repeated to myself but as I have fully answered them all to Mr Bunn and to the Chief and in part to the Department it will not be necessary to repeat them now. Be sure that the children were well fed and well clothed. The man who is now Agent here was my assistant in the school last year and had special charge of the boy's clothing and can vouch for it that it was well attended to and goods supplied were first class in every way. He also issued the clothing to the children when they went out for their holidays.\n\nI thank you for drawing my attention to the paragraph in regulations pertaining to the education of Indian children. I had not caught the significance of the word any in that connection well enough to have remembered it from the time that I read the regulations till the time of needing to use them.\n\nyours sincerely\n\n(Signed) J.A. Lousley.\nSept 29th, 1915.\n\nChief Berens,\n\nBerens River,\nMan.\n\nDear Chief Berens,\n\nMr Carter was here on a visit to the school a few weeks ago and while in my office he gave me a report of an interview he had with you in July, 1914, re your request for a change of the Missionary at Berens River, and also your repetition of this request in July last. Not knowing your request until a few weeks ago you will understand my silence to you on that subject. It was partly an oversight on Mr Carter's part in not reporting the interview sooner and also, I think, he thought that probably time might change your opinion, but inasmuch as the repetition was made last July, he thought it his duty to convey to me your thought on the matter.\n\nHad I known that this was your mind, I certainly would have had a conversation with you when I was there this summer, but I was up at the mission house and stayed there longer than I had intended to.\n\nHence when I got back there was no time before leaving.\n\nI sent a letter to you by your son Willie asking the particular business about which you wished to see me in reply to the note you sent me to Norway House. Now that I have your thought on this very important subject I will give it consideration and also seek the advice of the Revd. MR Arnup, our associate Secretary from Toronto, who visited you a year ago and made a tour of our work on the Lake Winnipeg district.\n\nIn the meantime you can rest assured that the best interest of our work will be considered and we will do the very best we can under the circumstances.\n\ntrusting that we will be divinely guided,\n\nyours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) T.Ferrier.\n\nT.F./ M.C.E.\nChief Berens, Berens River,\nMan.\n\nDear Chief Berens;-\n\nI understand that a number of your children from the reserve who were sent to the Norway House Boarding School and were sent back home on a holiday have not been returned by their parents or guardians to the School, and that certain reports have been made regarding the treatment of these children at the school. These reports and objections are based upon the way the children have been fed and clothed.\n\nNow I wish to say to you by way of explanation from the point of view of managing the school and the difficulty that Mr. Lousley the Principal, was under last year, that we did not know that the school would be opened to receive pupils until almost the close of navigation. Nor did we anticipate that the attendance would run up so high as it really did during the nine months, so that the supply of food and clothing sent in ran out in some lines before navigation opened up again when fresh supplies could be sent in. The Principal did the very best he could under the circumstances. The children were never cold as the building was always comfortable and they had plenty to eat.\n\nWe had another difficulty and that was they had no proper place to keep fish and meat. You know the old buildings were burned down. This condition has been remedied this summer.\n\nA proper supply of food and clothing has been sent in and a refrigerator in which to keep meat and fish has been built.\n\nThus you will see that any grounds for objections that they might have had has been taken away and overcome by the provision that has now been made. I need not say to you as Chief that these children can be taken back to the school by the Department in spite of whether the parents are willing or not.\nnow that they have been entered as pupils of the school. But my object in writing you is to give you this word of explanation and also to ask you for your assistance in influencing the return of the children to the school so that it will be done without any harsh measures.\n\nYou have always stood by the best interests of your people and the children and I feel confident that you will be able to pour oil on the troubled waters and lend your assistance in the right direction since it will be based upon your good judgement.\n\nHoping that you will be spared many years to render your services as Chief among the people to whom you have so long occupied that relationship.\n\nyours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) T.Ferrier.\n\nT.F./ M.C.H.\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nI am enclosing copies of letters referring to the children of Beren's River who have attended the Norway House Boarding School of which we had conversation when I was with you at Brandon.\n\nWhile it is imperative that discipline is maintained, from our conversation I gathered that there had been some unavoidable delay in placing provisions at Norway House and this has given some colour to the statements of Willie Berens; it would seem policy to explain to Chief Beren's and the other parents.\n\nWill you please pardon me if I suggest that if you are not visiting Beren's River in the near future, you write the Chief making what explanation you think best about this matter and making answer to the other charges of which I left with you a copy, shewing that my negligence, only has been the cause of your not replying to the Chief's letter.\n\nThe Chief is a little touchy and sometimes thinks he is not treated with sufficient respect. He has great influence with his people and I believe, if possible, it is always best to have the children return to school without force.\n\nI will be at Beren's River about the end of this month and shall be pleased to do what I can for you there and will issue the warrants and necessary legal papers as you may desire.\n\nKindest regards to all at Brandon,\n\nyours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nRevd T. Ferrier,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nDear Mr Lousley,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo referring to absentees from your school belonging to the Beren's River Band.\n\nIn reply I would say that Chief Berens made complaint of the quality of the food and other things to me when I was at Beren's River at the time of the annuity payments.\n\nIn reference to your doubt as to whom to apply for the compulsion of the attendance of pupils I would refer you to section 12 of the regulations pertaining to Indian children which states, that, \"any Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace shall, on information made to that effect by an authorized officer of the Department, issue a warrant authorizing the person named therein to search for and take such child back to the school\"; so that, as there is a Police Magistrate at Beren's River, this can be accomplished at any time, but I would suggest that the matter be first submitted for Mr Ferrier's consideration and I shall be visiting the Beren's River reserve in the near future and perhaps be able to adjust the matter satisfactorily to all and avoid friction.\n\nI will write Mr Ferrier by this mail.\n\nyours very truly\n\nJ.H. Carter\n\nRevd J.A. Lousley,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House Man.\n\nAug II, 1915\n\nMr Carter\nIndian Agent of Fisher River Agency,\n\nDear Mr Carter,\n\nI am sorry to have to trouble you again but it is unavoidable.\n\nJames Arkinson of Grand Rapids brought his daughter Bella here and asked me to take her into school. Can you send me or Mr Stewart her treaty No., so that we can fill in her application for admission.\n\nLast winter I brought up some children to this school from Beren's River and promised to let them home for holidays so long as they returned them promptly. I kept my agreement but when I reached there on my way out from Winnipeg, expecting to bring back the children the Chief and every other parent refused to let them come. The cause of the trouble was Willie Berens came here in the spring just at a time when we cannot get whitefish nor could we take sturgeon. We bought all the Jackfish and pickerel that the Indians offered yet could not get enough to feed the children and so supplemented with suckers.\n\nThey also complain that the boys were made to work outside when they sent them to school only to learn. You, however, know that that is the Government's regulation for all Boarding and Industrial schools and Principals have no option in the matter but are expected to put the children on the half-day system.\n\nI had quite a prompt letter this spring from Ottawa telling me I was very lax in this matter because I did not have the boys out at outdoor work more.\n\nPoliceman Rose of the R.N.W.M.P. expects to go out to Winnipeg soon and will call at Beren's River on his way back and is willing to bring them with him if he gets the proper authority. I do not know whether I should appeal to you or Mr Stewart. The children are in your Agency but the school to which they have been admitted by the Department is in Mr Stewart's.\nAgency. I have written to Mr Stewart, he passes through Cross Lake soon, asking him to issue a warrant but I do not know whether he will or not. You will no doubt be aware of where authority for this is vested. I remember the case of Barbara Scott with which you dealt so effectually and satisfactorily and hope you will do what you can to have these children sent back. If it is necessary Mr Lowes could have a warrant issued at Beren's River if there is a Magistrate there. I will write to Mr Lowes and prepare him for any communication you may think best to send him.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Signed) J.A. Lousley.\n\nNames of the children there are as follows:\nJoe Berens, Willie Everett, Cubby, Harry, and Charlie Green,\nWm. Simple, Jno Jae Japan, Nancy and Mary Jane Ross.\n\nJ.A.L.\nI respectfully beg to submit for your information copies of letters bearing upon a report made to me at the annuity payments of 1915 at Beren's River by Chief Jacob Berens complaining that the children of the Beren's River band who had been admitted to the Norway House had been improperly treated.\n\nI expect you will consider that I have neglected my duty by not reporting the matter to the Department at an earlier date, but, as the correspondence herewith attached will show, I had thought the matter amicably settled to all concerned, and that it was not necessary.\n\nChief Berens complained that the children were fed rotten fish, were given poor clothes and turned out from the school at the holiday season to shift for themselves. He exhibited a coat and pair of shoes which his grandson had worn which were certainly dilapidated, but I am informed that the poor state of the clothing was due to the fact that the children had been playing about for three weeks while waiting for transportation to their homes, and that when the children were dismissed for holidays the clothing was in good order. The same informant, I regret to state, affirms that the fish fed to the children was totally unfit for human food.\n\nWhen visiting the Beren's River reserve, recently, the Chief wished me to report the whole matter to the Department, as after being allowed by Mr Lousley to keep his grandson to look after him he feels hurt that such measures were taken and feels particularly insulted by Mr Lousley's letter of\nJanuary 16th, last, and cannot understand why he is blamed for not sending his grandson back to the school when he had been given to understand the boy might stay with him.\n\nWhile expressing himself as always amendable to the laws of the Government, Chief Berens states that so long as Mr Lousley is in charge of the school at Norway House he will feel justified in preventing any more children of the Beren's River band from entering that school.\n\nI greatly regret the very unpleasant task of reporting this to you but feel constrained to submit the matter to you for your judgement.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nDuncan C.

We are three hundred miles from civilization.\n\nFor the past few years we have had a \"White\" Public School here but owing to the families of the Rev. J.A. Leusley and ex Indian Agent Mr. J.S. Stewart moving away from this place we are left without sufficient number of children to organize a school for the coming year.\n\nI have three children\u2014a girl 15 years just passed her \"Entrance\" another one 13 years and one boy 11 years\u2014and it is obviously imperative that these should continue their education.\n\nSituated as I am you will readily understand this was a serious problem. I talked the matter over with the Rev. Mr. Denyes principal of the I.B. School; Indian Agent Mr. Jones and Inspector of Indian Agencies Mr. J. Bunn; each of these gentlemen advised me to write you on the matter respectfully asking that my children be allowed to attend the day classes in the I.B.S. at this place.\n\nI am advised by the principal that there would be ample room in the class room and I am led to believe by the other gentlemen that they would have no objection.\n\nI should very much appreciate this concession if the Deputy Supt.\nof Indian Affairs can see his way clear to approve of this arrangement being carried out?\n\nSincerely asking that you will excuse the liberty I have taken in bringing this matter before you.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nChief Fire Ranger\nAugust 25th, 1916.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have your communication of the 19th instant, expressing the wish to have your children attend the day classes at the Norway House Boarding School, and in reply I would state that, provided there is accommodation and the teachers have no objection, the Department is quite willing that your children should have the benefit of instruction in these classes.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\nMEDICAL REPORT OF AGENT NORQUAY FOR THE MONTH OF MAY,\n\nNORWAY HOUSE AGENCY\n\nI find difficulty in accounting for the number of the boarding school pupils who have been suffering from minor ailments during the winter. There are a number of them who have been in bed several days of each week, yet on examination there is nothing in their physical condition to account for same. The beds in the dormitories are rather close together and may be contributory to the cause. The food is good and there is plenty opportunity for outdoor exercises.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter 168918 dated July 25th 1917.\n\nI have written the Principals of the Boarding Schools asking them to pursue a course of rigid economy.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nActing Agent\n\nMr Martin Benson\nIn charge of Schools Branch\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nLAKE WINNIPEG INSPECTORATE\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 4th September 1917\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nWhen I was at Norway House recently, I visited the Boarding School operated there under the auspices of the The Methodist Church of Canada, and in going over the premises, I went through the stables with the Principal and the Rev. T. Ferrier, who was visiting the school at that time.\n\nThe administration of the department, so far as the farming and gardening work, is being handled by the Principal, the Rev. George F. Denyes, in good shape. Mr. Denyes is a practical man, with personal experience in the management of a farm, so that he brings to bear, in his work here, this very useful knowledge and experience; he is doing his work in an economical manner, and from what I saw, he should have fair results in his potatoes and other vegetables for this season's work.\n\nHe has done considerable clearing of the land within the limits of the 40 acres that comprise the school site, in all his work, of clearing, he has added about 15 to 17 acres which has all been brushed, the cut timber or trees has been converted into firewood, when possible and the brush gathered up and burned, and over the cleared area, he has sown grass seed, so that there has been some grazing afforded for his cows, as soon as the stumps are removed this area will be used for increased farming.\n\nThe Rev. Principal, has been successfully raising pigs. He now wishes to add to his herd of cows. He would like to get about 3 more cows, these can be supplied by\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfrom the herd that Mr Ferrier has at the Brandon Indian Industrial School, all young cows, of good breeding, and a horse 5 years old, standard breed. These can be placed at the school at Norway House for the sum of $500.00, if this is in order, and the expenditure can be authorised. I know that Mr Denyes will use them to advantage in furthering his wishes to put this side of the work on a good footing, that he hopes will assist in the maintenance of the school.\n\nFor good stock, and this I understand Mr Ferrier promises would be the standing of the cows and horse to be furnished, delivered at the school at Norway House. I think the price is reasonable.\n\nThe farming operations at Norway House, in the hands of Mr Denyes will, I have no doubt, assure successful conditions, and contribute to making the cost of operation lighter, and these conditions will open up a better chance to educate the pupils in this line of work.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nREPORT OF THE WORK AT NORWAY HOUSE.\n\nThe present staff and salary paid to each:\n\nRev.

All of the stock are looking well and of good quality. These will supply the institute with all the beef, pork, butter and milk that will be consumed during the coming year. Both the stock and garden are an object lesson to the people as to what can be accomplished toward supplementing the native food, such as moose, game, berries and fish.\n\nTo assist the management two things are greatly needed. (1.) A good barn, stable and root house. These could all be accomplished with one good building which would cost about $2,000.00 for material. (2.) About five or six thousand drain tile to drain the land now under cultivation and these drained to the lake in a deep open drain. This open ditch will be dug this fall and about twenty-five acres cleared of timber on the island about four miles down the Nelson River.\n\nThe interest taken in the different departments is shown by the order, neatness and cleanliness of the building and also in the general appearance of the pupils. Special mention should be made of the amount of land that is in preparation for garden and pasture. The entire 40 acres of mission property has been cleared during the past two years and some grass seed sown on about 8 acres. About 5 acres are under cultivation and planted in garden produce, potatoes and turnips.\noutlook for a good return this fall is not very encouraging on account of the backward spring and continual rainfall up to the present. The land is very cold and wet and growth is slow. However, the principal is well versed in the art of gardening and farming and will be able to cope with the natural drawbacks that are peculiar to this northern climate.\n\nMany improvements have been made. Special mention should be given to the grading of the roads and preparation of land. More has been accomplished in this line during the past two years than in all the previous years combined.\n\nA few minor repairs are required such as broken plaster in the main building. These will be repaired by the plasterer who is here plastering the new mission house. The rain water from the main building should be conducted to the water tank in the rear of the building. It is now caught in eight different places by forty gallon barrels. All of these are kept over-flowing during the rainy season and more or less of the surplus water soaks around the foundation as shown on the laundry floor and other parts of the basement which were never properly shaped to the drain, being higher at the drain than most floors which results in an inch of water in other places.\n\nThe building is kept neat and clean throughout. Good work is done in all the departments. More work on the garden is being accomplished than has been in the history of our school work here and this accomplished by the boys. The order and discipline is good. The children are well cared for. The food is wholesome and yet in harmony with present restrictions. Their clothing is up to the mark, particular attention being given to footwear.\n\nThe members of the staff who are here are capable and of a fine spirit and it is to be hoped that the new members will fit into the spirit and atmosphere of the institution.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of the work of the Principal, who is the first on the job from early morning and the last to quit at night. The day's work covers some part of the entire programme of duties with special care over the welfare of the garden, land, stock, freighting and building of the new house and immediate oversight of all the boys while engaged in their industrial pursuit. Thus giving the key note to the industrial, moral and religious life of the pupils and staff.\nClose by the site of the Mission House there is an old grave-yard. This was the first grave-yard started by Rev. James Evans, our first missionary to Norway House, who invented the Salabie characters whereby our hymns and the Bible have been given to the Cree people in their own tongue.\n\nThis grave-yard has been growing wild and the fence rotting down. It is many years since any dead have been buried there. During the year Mr. Denyes has removed the fence, plowed it up and intends leveling the surface and seeding it down with lawn grass, also building a low stone fence on the south side next to the mission house. The people are expressing some dissatisfaction about what has been done. We explained to the Chief that we would place a stone with one inscription for all the dead, there being no mark of description upon any grave.\n\nMr. Denyes and I have conferred together and we think that it would be very fitting to place a good stone there in memory not only of the dead but in memory of James Evans, for he being dead yet speaketh by every hymn book and Bible printed in the Cree language.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe question of handling the supplies for the Inland Missionaries must receive special attention by the Board. The North-West Navigation Company land it at Norway House for $0.50 per 100 lbs. It is here stored and taken care of by the Principal of the school and usually given out to the canoe men who come after it. Freighting from here to Island Lake costs $14.00 per 100 lbs. To Oxford House it costs $6.00 per 100 lbs. This should be provided for over and above the usual salary.\n\nMr. Gaudin makes about two trips especially for freight at a cost of about $25.00 per trip. The balance of his freight is usually taken back when he has to come to Norway House for other reasons. I would suggest that the missionary of Gross Lake have a special grant of $50.00 be made to cover cost of freighting and that a grant of $600.00 be made to the Island Lake and Oxford House missionaries and that it be expended by the purchasing of a canoe at $100.00 and the $500.00 be given to two good men for three months' service with the understanding that they make two trips to Oxford House and two to Island Lake. That these men be hired by the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School and be under his order and direction.\n\nThe balance of the freight required can be handled by the missionaries themselves when they come in to Norway House for other reasons.\n\nIn this connection a special grant of $150.00 should be given to Nelson House toward freighting goods from the Pas.\nThe new mission house is under construction and is well on the way towards completion. We have three men all specialists in their own line, looking after the carpenter work, installing a furnace and doing the plastering. These are assisted by the Principal and boys of the school together with a few good men of the community. The building is two storey, 30 x 36'. It has a cement wall and floor basement the full size. A summer kitchen and wood shed behind and a veranda in front. All are built with first-class seasoned material in modern plans and specifications heated by a large wood furnace. A three flue chimney with footing on the rock built of stone and cement to first floor answers for furnace, kitchen range, and fire grate in the study.\n\nThe Basement:\n\nThe basement walls have footing on the rock with drain tile all around the outside and all drained by a 4\" pipe to the lake. The ceiling is lined up with finished lumber and serves for furnace and fuel. There is a cement cistern, laundry and store room for milk, fruit etc. also a winters' supply of vegetables.\n\nGround Floor:\n\nThe ground floor consists of parlor, study, dining-room, kitchen, pantry and a reception room for the Indian people.\n\nUpstairs:\n\nThe upstairs has 4 bed-rooms, bath-room, sewing-room and clothes closets.\n\nAttic:\n\nThe attic is covered with shiplap and can be used as a store-room. It has a water tank supplied by 4 pumps from cistern and well. We have also laid a 1-\u00bd inch pipe in the drain to the lake for water supply.\n\nThe outside wall has two air spaces and six thicknesses of building paper; three inside and three out; finished outside with siding and inside with plaster. The material is all first-class, the lumber mostly British Columbia fir well seasoned. Some of it has been stored for four years. The roof is covered with British Columbia cedar shingles. The ground floor is hard maple. The present finish is two coats of oil on all the wood work inside and out. This will preserve the materials and make an excellent foundation for painting.\n\nThe building is up-to-date, modern, warmly built, well constructed and has ample provision for heating. It is in keeping with the Government buildings, school, hospital and Agent's home, is sufficient for our work and its needs and we trust will prove a comfort to our\nmissionaries and a credit to the Methodist Church for many years to come. At present prices for material and labor it would cost about $9,000.00 and should be insured for $6,000.00. The principal of the school and his boys with members of his staff dug the cellar, put in the cement walls for the basement, hauled the sand with York boat towed by a gasoline launch a distance of nine miles, carried the lumber and material from dock and warehouse, dug the drain, filled in around the building, shaped the surroundings and assisted very materially with all unskilled labor. We engaged Mr. Allin of Toronto to put in a year's service and build the house for $1,000.00 and board. Our experience warrants the suggestion that we keep a skilled man for building and repairs on the District. Such a man should have been sent out with Mr. Atkinson to Oxford House to assist him in getting his home comfortable. Mr. Allin has proved to be such a help to our missionary work as well as in building this house that we propose to keep him on our staff at Brandon or Norway House and send him out to any place where important repairs are required or a new building to be constructed. This policy should have been adopted years ago by our Board in the expenditure of money for buildings on our home missions as well as on Indian missions.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company appears to have a large store of flour in all their Northern posts throughout the North country. It is a question whether there is not as much flour held by the Companies in this country as ought to be distributed under present restrictions during the next two or three years.\n\nMuch of the flour in stock is of the higher grades and a better quality is being used than is allowed in any other part of Canada. One exception to this is a grade called Prince Albert flour which was made of frozen wheat and when first brought into the country some eight years ago was sold as low as $2.00 per sack. Now it is sold at $8.00 on the plea that flour is scarce. At Island Lake flour is sold at $40.00 per sack and butter at $2.00 per pound and other prices are in proportion. These are paid for in trade for furs. These prices prove that the Company is not doing business in this country upon any charitable basis or with any desire to help the poor Indian.\n\nIt is also common report that not an employee of the Hudson Bay Company has been conscripted in all the Norway House Agency and there are among them men physically fit and of military age. The plea is that the Indian would starve if the men were taken. This should be looked after by the Military Authorities and they should see that no favors are given to any company in these times of war.\n\nThere should be an order from the Food Controller that no more flour be shipped by the Hudson Bay Company to its outside posts until 1920 without special permission from the Government and Food Administrator. Also that the flour now in the country should have a fair distribution.\namong other traders and settlers who have not stored up supplies beyond present regulations and also that the prices be fixed according to wholesale rates plus freight rates. There are more traders in this country and more money being received by the people than in times of peace. The latter is accounted for by Separation allowances. Men are greatly in demand and high wages are being paid. The fishing season was good, men making from $250 to $300.00 per month during the two months of white fish catch. The result is that the people are living on flour, meat and canned goods without any restrictions when they should be living on the native foods of this country.\n\nThis is a very strategic time in the history of these people. They are willing to be loyal. They need leading and can be trained to take a great step toward independence. No greater blessing could be given them than to force them to secure their food from the land, forest, lake and stream. The people need organizing on a progressive policy on gardening and securing the natural foods of the country and how to preserve and store the same, particularly garden produce and potatoes.\n\nThey need to be pressed and made to prepare their land this Fall for gardens next year. To this end all Government officials, traders, teachers and missionaries should unite to lift these people to a higher grade of living and a more progressive policy toward the independence of the people. This is a time when we have a splendid reason to teach them they must root hog or die and we need not fear that any of them will die of starvation.\n\nIt is also a question whether this would not be an opportune time for some standard bank to open a small branch at Norway House. It would be a great convenience to the traders and other settlers and a source of education and inspiration to our Indian people to lay by for the future.\n\n------------------------\n\nThe Day School for reserve children taught by Miss Royan was closed during my visit being holiday time.\n\nAs far as I am able to learn Miss Royan is an excellent teacher for Indian children and is doing good work. She also fits in to the social life of the institute and staff. I have engaged her for another year.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am enclosing you a copy of my report of a recent visit to Norway House. There may be information in it that will be of use to you but some parts do not concern the Department.\n\nThe portion of it applying to the Hudson Bay Company has not been prepared for the public but it is of such vital interest for the welfare of the Indian people of that Northern land that I think it only right to bring the attention of our Church and the Department to the same. No greater blessing could be given to our Indian people than to force them to get out and hustle for their daily food. As long as they have money they will always buy the canned goods and food shipped in. I would like your personal opinion and advice regarding this part of the report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nSeptember 4th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nMany thanks for sending me a copy of your interesting report on the Norway House school.

Taylor, Norway House, in regard to supplies for the Rossville day school at Norway House, dated June 18, 1920. Original on 118279/4.\n\nRegarding the desks asked for, I would say it is not necessary to furnish them. There are sufficient desks to seat all the day scholars from the reserve. The shortage of seating room is owing to some of the boarding school pupils being taught in our day school. Regarding this, I would like to ask the Department if this should be carried on. It appears to me that the boarding school should have enough room to seat all the pupils enrolled. A separate building is used for the junior classes. Only one class room is used in the school. The second class room being used for a girls' play room. Notwithstanding this, they saddle some of the boarding school pupils on the teacher of the day school, and take up the room of the day school children. Kindly advise.\nOttawa, June 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and with reference to the desks asked for for the use of the Roseville Indian Day School I beg to say that you should inform the school authorities that it is considered that there are sufficient desks to seat all the day scholars from the reserve and that it would appear that the boarding school should have enough room to seat all the pupils, without sending them for class-room instruction to the day school. If the two class-rooms in the boarding school are used for the purpose for which they are intended, there should be no need of sending any of the pupils to receive class-room instruction in the day school, and you will be good enough to bring this matter to the attention of the Principal of the boarding school and inform him and the teacher of the day school that it is not the intention to provide any further desks for the class-room in the day school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Dept. letter No. 168918/1, dated June 30, relating to seating of boarding school pupils in the Roseville day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I will bring this matter contained in your letter to the attention of the Boarding school authorities, and to the teacher of the Day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst.

Blackford as Principal of the Norway House Boarding School. This nomination was made and endorsed by the Board, so that we trust Mr. Blackford is to be the future Principal. I feel sure that this will be in the interests of our work and will meet with the approval of the Indian Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I this week completed an Inspection of the Norway House Boarding School.\n\nI may say that much improvement has been made in the school building, especially in the way of brightening the rooms; considerable interior painting and kalsomining has been done, clothes cupboards and other conveniences added, and repairs made to walls and floors. The playrooms of the girls and boys have been made much brighter, and with no great expense, much of the work having been done by the staff and pupils. The electric wiring has been overhauled and made safe. The building, however, is being damaged by the heaving of the rear foundation wall.\n\nI found the building very clean and tidy, and everything in excellent order. The boys and girls are, with few exceptions, in excellent health, and are well clothed, well fed, well behaved and courteous.\n\nThe children are encouraged to take plenty of outdoor exercise, and an outdoor skating rink is kept in good condition, while almost all of the pupils are provided with skates. In the summer there are football, basketball and tennis.\n\nThe diet of the children is looked after by a nurse who has had considerable experience in Indian and Social Service work, who is in charge of the kitchen, and who besides cares for those in the Institution who require the assistance of a nurse. The food is of good quality, sufficient in quantity, well cooked and well served.\n\nI visited the stables, and found them very well cared for, but cold, low, damp and inconvenient. A number of good cows are kept, and the milk and butter used in the School. There should be an additional team of horses for hauling wood in winter, as those on hand are overworked at present.\n\nIn the class-rooms I found very good work being done. The old difficulty of securing clearly audible reading and answers to questions is evident here to some extent, but there is improvement in this direction. One class room is in the main building, where the class is divided, half the class attending in the morning, the remainder in the afternoon. The junior class room is a separate building some distance from the main building. The pupils here attend the former. The pupils are fully up to their Grade work, in fact, somewhat advanced in Arithmetic, I think, but this is rather an advantage. Four pupils of this School passed the Entrance Examination last July.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly. Two of them were of age to be discharged. Two remain in the School, Nos. 97 and 98, being 17 and 15 years of age respectively. Pupil No. 97 has, however, had to be excused from Classroom as he has developed Tuberculosis, and is under the Doctor's care, with a good chance of recovery, I understand. Pupil No. 98 is doing good work in Grade 9. The further classification of the pupils is as follows: Grade 1 - 27, Grade 2 - 16, Grade 3 - 8, Grade 4 - 13, Grade 5 - 7, Grade 6 - 15, which I consider unusually high for an Indian School.\n\nThe Principal and Staff of this School are to be congratulated on the excellence of the work being done in all departments.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 25, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 758-3A of February 23rd - your report on the Norway House Indian Boarding School, forwarded by Mr. Commissioner Graham of Regina.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department agrees with you that the staff and principal are to be congratulated on the conditions that you have found.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nAt the time of my visit to Norway House this summer there were many repairs and some new equipment needed. Action has been taken on the files in this connection.\n\nIn the future we should place a new fence around the 40 acre lot - $250 is an estimate. A root house is needed - $300 is required in this connection. Eight wash basins should be supplied soon for the boys' basement, and a cottage for smaller girls is needed in the future. Two tanks for rain water, and a drain for the overflow and to clear the furnace pitt could be installed for $300.\n\nAuthority should be given to the Principal and Agent to arrange for a change in the land surrender to straighten out the school property. Blue prints should be directed when this authority is offered.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 4, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince the repairs have been made to the Norway House Boarding School and the attic of the building has been floored, all of which was done under the authority of the Department, the principal is able to use this attic as a large store-room, thus making room in other portions of the building.\n\nAt present, the pupilage is 96. The principal has no trouble in securing many more pupils than this number. I would like authority to be given him to increase the pupilage, from the first of October, up to 100, and from the first of April, 1923, up to 105.\n\nI may say that our Board of Missions has been putting into this school, for maintenance, a little over $6,000 a year for a number of years, and this extra pupilage would help us in the financing of the institution.\n\nKindly let me know if this meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 10, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, requesting that the pupilage at Norway House be increased at this time from 96 to 100, and that provision be made for a pupilage of 105 for the next fiscal year.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General and he has authorized the increases requested, as follows: from the first instant, a pupilage of 100 and from the first of April, 1923, a pupilage of 105. Mr. Agent Gordon and Mr. Commissioner Graham are being informed of the present increase, and, if Parliament passes the item, they will be instructed regarding the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

WEST, DATED SEPT 11, 1922, ON THE NORWAY HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\n573832\n\nOriginal on File No. 123-5-6.\n\nXXX XXX XXX\n\nIn regard to Study Periods on time table it seemed to me a classroom with 8 classes can have no clear periods for study. Teacher might arrange time table so as always to be busy while in room.\n\nXXXX XXX XXX\nSir,\n\nI beg to report as follows on Norway House Boarding School, this Agency. While I have not made a formal inspection of this School for some time, yet I am in close touch with the work at all times, in the building and round the grounds frequently, meeting the children and the members of the staff, or some of them, daily.\n\nI find that the building is kept in excellent condition, clean and sanitary. The grounds are also kept very well, but are being changed considerably, which upsets things, and detracts from appearances for the time. As I have previously pointed out, on more than one occasion, the foundation wall on the north side of the main building is in need of attention. The water system has been out of commission since April that is, the water line from the lake. My tanner and team have been hauling water to the old reservoir, from which it is pumped into the building. The new stable is progressing and will be a very good building, and will add much to the appearance of the premises, when the old stables are removed. My letter of June 11th, No. 10A contains recommendations re the water line.\n\nThe area of broken land is being gradually added to. This is a slow and difficult process, as the ground is very full of stumps, and also stony in places. A fair area can be brought under cultivation on Hope Island, but this too must be cleared of stumps and stones, and will represent a great deal of work. In a few years' time the feed problem should be solved. The school has a good number of good cows, and these supply a large quantity of milk to the table, also some butter.\n\nThe health of the children is very good. No deaths have occurred among the pupils of this school for more than two years, and very little sickness. They all appear well nourished, and with the exception of a few cases of glands, in excellent health. Their behavior is also very good. I do not consider that the classroom work is of as high a standard as it was, largely due to inexperience on the part of the teachers. Both teachers of the past year were College Graduates, but had no professional training. I fully appreciate the difficulty in securing trained teachers for this work for the possible salary.\n\nThis School has an excellent staff, and is doing excellent work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Act. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\nExtract from letter of Wm. Gordon, Indian Agent, Norway House, Dated July 2, 1923 (His No. 7A)\n\nOriginal on 123-5-10.\n\n---\n\nThe Department will doubtless observe that a number of the pupils, both boys and girls, but particularly the boys, have been out of the classroom a great deal. Much extra work is being done at the school, breaking new land, building fences, etc., but I would suggest that pupils under the age of 16 at least, or Grade 6 or even 7, should have at least half day classroom work, unless under very special circumstances.\n\n(Sgd.) Wm. Gordon.\nOttawa, July 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 8 A of the 2nd instant, reporting generally on the Norway House Indian Boarding School. I have noted, with satisfaction, that you are in close touch with the activity at this institution at all times. The Department is pleased to note that the school is being well managed and is doing excellent work. You should make a special report on the repairs necessary to the foundation on the north side of the building. Indicate, if possible, what materials are needed and intimate whether or not expert labour would have to be engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, July 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your No. 7 A of the 2nd instant, relative to the classroom attendance at the Norway House Indian Boarding School. The Department agrees that, unless under very special circumstances, the boys and girls in residential schools should have, regularly, a half day classroom activity. At the time of harvest, or when special work is being undertaken, it may be impracticable to have the older boys in the classroom; but, generally speaking, the Department insists on 5 half days' academic instruction per week.\n\nPlease intimate to the Principal the nature of this communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen the Superintendent of Indian Education and I were at Norway House a year ago last summer it was understood that the grant for attendance should be raised from 96 to 100 for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1923 and for the present fiscal year it was to be raised to 105. I have word from the principal that his average attendance will exceed 100 as he had 102 in actual residence at the beginning of the year. I would appreciate it very much if this could be noted when his reports come in and also that the Agent at Norway House be notified of the increase of the number for per capita grant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVoted at 105\nBrandon, February 7th, 1924\nOttawa, Feb. 20, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the pupilage allowed in the case of the Norway House Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that I am today directing a communication to the Indian Agent, notifying him that grant will be allowed for 105 in the case of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, Feb. 20, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has increased the pupilage in the case of the Norway House Indian Residential School and that grant will be allowed for 105 as from the first of this calendar year. Please inform the principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on July 1st, two young men, Matthew Nakawey and Alex Saunders, Indians of this Reserve and returned soldiers, and who were employees of the Forestry Branch, became intoxicated, and created considerable disturbance in the vicinity of and within the school here. I was away from the Agency at the time the trouble began. On my return, later in the evening, I was informed of the occurrence, and immediately placed the young men under arrest, and sent them to the R.C.M.P. Barracks.\n\nThe next morning, July 2nd, on the information and Complaint of the Principal, Mr. J.T. Blackford, I tried these men under Sec. 139, Sub.-sec. 2, and convicted them, and imposed a penalty on each of a fine of $50.00 and costs, or two months' imprisonment. The fines were paid.\n\nBefore proceeding with the trial, the Principal informed me that he intended to press two other charges against the men, assault and Disturbing a Religious meeting. As these did not come within the jurisdiction of an Indian Agent, I did not proceed with them. One of these charges, Assault, we settled out of court, the young men agreeing to pay Mr. Blackford $75.00 for broken teeth (false set), which money was paid the Principal through my hands. Regarding the second, the Principal sent to Cross Lake for a Magistrate, who fined the men $30.00 each, with costs of $27.60 each. In all, the spree cost each man about $147.60.\n\nNot yet content, the Principal demanded of the Forestry Superintendent for the District that the men be discharged. He stated, in my hearing, that he was going to see that they were discharged, if he had to write to Forestry headquarters at Ottawa. The men were discharged.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nIndian Office, Regina.\nI understand the young men used very vile language at the school, and consider that they deserved severe punishment, which they received. I would say, however, that we have comparatively little drinking here, that these men were on the recreation ground, (Reserve property) when the trouble began, that their visit to the school was not entirely unprovoked, that three separate charges were laid against them, that they were quite submissive to me, and when I told them they must go to the Barracks offered no resistance; that they are good workers, and their services were entirely satisfactory to the Forestry Department; that one of these men lost a good house, upon which he had spent much time and money, only last winter, when away from home cutting wood for the school, and which he is now endeavoring to replace, and the loss of his employment means hardship, when work is scarce.\n\nI would call attention to the calling of a Magistrate from Cross Lake, sixty miles away, at the expense of these men, and the costs imposed thereby, and also to the unwarranted action of the Principal in insisting on the discharge of these men from their employment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Wm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. July 30th, 1924\n\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that I received from Indian Agent Gordon, regarding the conduct of the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School in dealing with the case of two Indians who were charged with being intoxicated at Norway House.\n\nI would ask if you think Mr. Blackford is a fit and proper person to have charge over an institution. If what Mr. Gordon says is true, I would say he is not. I have no hesitation in saying that he is a most unreasonable man, and I do not think this matter should pass without some further action being taken by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLONG ON OUTPOST DUTY\n\nMrs. Willard Cummings, of Calgary, recently made a visitation of the Indian hospital, school and mission to the Crees at Norway House, nearly four hundred miles up Lake Winnipeg and the northern waterways of Manitoba. On return to Winnipeg she describes her surprise at finding at the northern post a boarding school which housed 100 boys and girls. It was well equipped and attractive as any similar institution in a city, Mrs. Cummings reports.\n\nThe hospital, which was burned down over a year ago, was being rebuilt. The Indian Department's generous and wise provision for educational needs of its wards found a warm admirer in the visitor, but her chief amazement was at the long service of the workers.

Before intelligent consideration can be given to this request, it will be necessary to know the exact size - three dimensions - of the dormitories. I understand that some months ago some alterations on the top floor provided more accommodation. Please explain to the Rev. Principal that the request is being considered and submit the figures to the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nSir;\n\nReferring to your letter No.123-5-1, of Sept.25th, re the mooted increase of pupilage of the Norway House Residential School from 105 to 110, I today took the measurements of the dormitories in this school and found them roughly as follows:\n\n16.775 cubic ft. No.1. 31 ft. X 27 ft. 9 in. X 9 ft. 9 in.\n17.586 cubic ft. No.2. 31 \" X 27 ft. 9 in. X 9 \" 9 \".\n17.586 cubic ft. No.3. 31 \"2\" X 27 ft. 9 in X 10 ft. 2 in.\n17.586 cubic ft. No.4. 31 \"2\" X 27 \" 9 in X 10 \" 2 \".\n\nI know of no increase in the sleeping accommodations for pupils in this institution. During the summer months some balcony space is utilized, but for at least six months of the year this is not used.\n\nMay I protest against any further increase to the pupilage of this Institution. In my opinion, a reduction should be made until the accommodation is increased. The dormitories are already overcrowded, while it is necessary to take some of the pupils into the Roseville Day school to relieve congestion in the two classrooms of the Boarding school. The latter is objectionable, but not impossible, but the overcrowding of the sleeping accommodations is a most serious matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nStory letter on no account any increase in current accom.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRelative to the request for an increase in the pupilage of the Norway House Indian Residential School from 105 to 110, I have to inform you that the number of pupils for which the grant is at present allowed is in excess of the accommodation as to air space in the school. The Department cannot approve of the increasing of the pupilage, owing to the present accommodation, and the number of 105 is not to be exceeded. We are requesting our agent at Norway House to inform the principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, giving the measurements of the dormitories at the Norway House Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that the number of pupils for which the grant is at present allowed, viz.: 106, is not to be exceeded. You should inform the principal that he is not to recruit any children in excess of that number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nSome time ago I received word from the Indian Agent, Mr. Gordon, here, that, owing to lack of dormitory space, the Indian Dept. could not authorize as Grant earning pupils, a number in excess of that now pertaining\u2014viz. 105.\n\nNot knowing how this matter was presented to the Indian Dept. by the Agent, and believing that if the former were informed of all the circumstances in this connection they would give a favourable consideration to our application to allow an increase in the number of pupils for this school, I would very respectfully ask the privilege of briefly stating here the case for the school.\n\nIt was never my intention to accept Applications for Admission in excess of the number authorized by the Indian Department. That this number has been exceeded was largely through the unexpected successful recruiting of boys.\n\nEver since the opening of this school the number of girls received from year to year has been greatly in excess of the number of boys. The number of pupils from distant Reservations were always small. That for several years several of the Outpost Reserves failed to send a child. That for several years we have been pushing the recruiting of children, especially boys, for the school. That it is only this last two seasons we have had much success.\nWhen the number of applications for admission of girls reached the maximum number of girls admitted to the school last year, no further applications were accepted\u2014the number thus deferred being fifteen.\n\nRealizing that we had as much room for boys as we had for girls\u2014in fact a little more, the dimensions of dormitories is given at the last of this letter\u2014we did push the recruiting of boys. We were successful and we have five more boys than we had last year, viz. 47. We have no more girls than last year although, as I shall point out, we have more sleeping accommodation. This is owing to the fact that not less than four\u2014sometimes more\u2014girls sleep out on their balcony. This is Jan. 5th, the girls are still sleeping there and will continue to do so all winter. This has never been done in the winter before.\n\nWe have a spare room that could be utilized as sleeping apartments for a number of girls but\u2014as this room is not very convenient\u2014it did not seem necessary, under the circumstances, to use it.\n\nBriefly put\u20141st. That while we have but the same number of girls as last year we are utilizing more sleeping space.\n\n2nd.\u2014That, in my judgement, we have ample room for fifty boys while we have only forty seven in the school at present.\n\n3rd.\u2014That in refusing to accept more girls than we accommodated last year and in accepting more boys, I was not seeking to ignore the Dept's. instructions as to the number of pupils allowed but rather was I seeking to act in accordance with what I believed to be their active policy of keeping their Boarding schools full. I felt that, under the circumstances in which I found myself when school opened at the close of holidays, the Indian Department would approve of my actions?\n\nYours very Respectfully\n\nJames T.

In the address which was read at the presentation reference was made to the virtues of Mr. Blackford which characterized all of Mr. Blackford's actions and his willingness to sacrifice his own comfort unselfishly for the welfare of others. Previous to taking over the work at the school Mr. Blackford had been in charge of the Forestry Station, but during the time he was there he was active in the work of the Church, so much so that the Government Inspector reported him for it. As principal of the school he has had the difficult task, but at the same time the great privilege, of helping to mould the lives of the children who have been under his care, many of whom, having graduated, are doing extremely well at this business of living.

MacKenzie Esq.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa \u2014 Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I received a communication re half-day classroom work in this Institution. I have awaited the time when I should feel more or less competent to speak on the plan and its results. After continuing from about Sept. 15, it would appear that I might be able to state something dependable.\n\nWe instituted the change as soon as the re-arrangement of work could be carried out. Our plan was to open classes at 9 A.M., the year throughout instead of 9 A.M. until Nov. 29th until April then reverting to 9 A.M. Beginning classes at 9 A.M. we have been continuing to 12:30 with the regular 10:30 intermission period. It seems...\nour teachers can accomplish about as much effective service as under the old plan.\n\nThe afternoons we devoted to outdoor exercises. For the boys a course in regular military drill for upward of one hour\u2014and then football or some other healthful games\u2014all under the direction of the teacher. The girls have been given the regular courses of drill taught in the regular ordinary day schools.\n\nWe have had a fine children's slide constructed according to our own invention. The Commercial Office was too small for beyond what I felt we could manage. This winter we have made a large open air rink on which all children both sexes are allowed by turns.\n\nDr. Temple and myself have had several conferences re general health of the children and others concern in our\nverdict that on the whole the general appearance of the pupils is much more healthful. For a time the smaller girls seemed to find the exercises a little tiresome but this seems to have gradually disappeared. When any tendency seems to present itself pupils are put to bed each afternoon for one hour's rest.\n\nAs might be expected we find we still have to battle against Tuberculosis in some but the fight seems to be a very decidedly favorable one except in the case of one little girl who was seriously affected before the school year. She has been in the hospital since Oct. 1st at which time her weight showed the decrease through the summer months to be still present.\n\nStudying the situation I am assured that the over-crowding of this school in the past accounts for the condition of many. But I understand originally\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nREV. W. W.

We carried 100 last year and this year we are finding we can maintain what appears to be a more satisfactory condition having but 84 pupils on our roll and a couple of three or four out for the year on sick leave.\n\nI trust you will receive this report on this matter favorably and feel free to give me by return mail any comments or advice you may deem wise.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI enclose formal report on the Norway House Residential School. May I offer a few observations for which there is not room on the form provided.\n\nThe school does not, in my opinion, fulfil its main functions to the extent that it should. I take it that the main object of a school should be, to advance the Indian, educationally, morally, physically and economically.\n\nEducationally. The average school graduate can speak read and write English. He can make simple arithmetical calculations which help in trading. But he speaks Cree in his home, he does little writing, takes, with few exceptions, little interest in reading, and uses his figures very little. A few have gone on to Grades 9, 9, or 10. One boy from Island Lake, transferred from this school to Brandon after Grade 9 is reported as doing well. He has ambition. The average graduate, however, does not appear to take any interest in reading, or anything which would take his mind from the petty scandals, etc., of his companions, or would occupy his mind during his leisure time, to keep him out of mischief. Educationally, however, some gradual advance can be discerned.\n\nMorally, the effect of the school appears to be detrimental. The segregation of boys and of girls, and the school restrictions appear to sharpen and develop in the pupil the sex idea, so that when they meet without these restrictions, this idea is dominant. The idea of resistance to the sex appeal does not appear to exist. One would naturally suppose that years of moral and religious training would inculcate some inhibitions, but except in rare individuals, this does not appear to be the case. Naturally, the girl who has been in the school dresses better, is neater and more cleanly than the average outsider, and as such is more attractive to the men. Add to this the fact that she is less conscious, and it will readily be seen that she has greater temptations than the girl who has been raised at home. Boy graduates also are likely to be more attractive to the women and girls, and at the age they graduate, have no desire to be moral. Having been in the school for some years, and being taught that education should make them superior to their parents, there is naturally very little restraint exercised by the parents on the school graduates.\n\nPhysically.- School graduates should be superior to those children brought up on the reserves. We hear frequently of \"starvation\" Indians on the reserves in these days, and there is no doubt that in many families the food supplies are neither abundant nor varied. There should be no question of sufficient nourishment and variety of diet in the school. The school children should be more regular and cleanly in their habits; they sleep in well ventilated dormitories with regulation air space, rather than in small and practically sealed rooms, often\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6268)\n\nFile 580-5, part 5\nThe Pas Agency - McKay Residential School - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1930 - 1933\n\nFile 580-5, part 6\nThe Pas Agency - McKay Residential School - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1933 - 1940\n\nFile 580-9, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - McKay Residential School - Church of England - School Lands - (Maps). 1912 - 1930\n\nFile 580-14, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - McKay Residential School - Church of England - Livestock. 1925 - 1933\n\nFile 581-1, part 1\nNorway House Agency - Norway House Residential School - United Church - General Administration. 1898 - 1933\n\nFile 581-1, part 2\nNorway House Agency - Norway House Residential School - United Church - General Administration. 1933 - 1946\n\nFile 581-3, part 1\nNorway House Agency - Norway House Residential School - United Church - Payments of Grants. 1931 - 1946\n\nFile 581-5, part 1\nNorway House Agency - Norway House Residential School - United Church - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1901 - 1907\n\nFile 581-5, part 3\nNorway House Agency - Norway House Residential School - United Church - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1921 - 1930\n\nFile 581-5, part 4\nNorway House Agency - Norway House Residential School - United Church - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1925 - 1930\nApril 15th, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Gordon,\n\nI have read with much interest your report of March 29th, dealing with the matter of Indian education. You set forth your observations and views very clearly and what struck me most in your report was that the views expressed agreed very largely with those to which I have arrived, both from reasoning a priori and from my somewhat small and short experience in the Department.\n\nIt seems to me that a clear distinction should be made between the educational development suitable for the hunting or primitive type of Indian, and those that are being prepared to earn their livelihood after the manner of white men. I may say that I am giving this matter considerable thought and while the Department does not contemplate any immediate change in policy, there are several matters which deserve and will receive the fullest consideration.\n\nI wish to thank you very much for the clear exposition of your views on a matter that is receiving considerable thought on the part of Department officials.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWilliam Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nApril 18th, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon.

Murphy -\n\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of letter which I have received from William Gordon, Indian Agent, Norway House, reporting on the Norway House Residential School, and Indian education in general.\n\nMr. Gordon's observations are sound and very clearly set forth, and I think might be considered in formulating a future policy in regard to Indian education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI believe that a simpler and less expensive course could be planned that would be of greater benefit to these people.\n\nIt may be outside my province but I think that certain features in the general management of this school could be improved.\n\nI want to assure you that I am not saying anything in a critical spirit. I am merely giving you a few ideas that have struck me and you may take them for what you may think they are worth.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.E.S. [Signature]\nSchool Inspector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI hope you will not consider me presuming if I say something here in addition to what I have said in my report on the Norway House residential school.\n\nThe school is well equipped with modern machinery and comforts and the instruction given is careful and comprehensive and the pupils when they graduate could do good work if they continued to live under anything like similar conditions. But since those attending this particular school live under vastly different conditions I feel that the course offered here does not give the maximum preparation for life and yet it costs a good deal.\nSir,\n\nIn a previous report, in March last, I offered some criticisms of the effects of our educational efforts, so far as applied to our Northern Indians. I realize that these criticisms were largely destructive in character. At the time, I had intended to follow with some suggestions as to improvement in our methods, but have found it difficult to clarify my ideas to a degree which would warrant their presentation to the Department.\n\nI would suggest that, so far as our Indians are concerned, the main objects of education, in the order of value are:\n\n(A) The development of a stable and dependable character.\n\n(B) To train the Indian to make the best use of the natural resources of his district for the maintenance of himself and his family. This would include thrift and conservation.\n\n(C) Sufficient academic training that he may be able to read and converse intelligently in English, desire to read, and to protect himself from exploitation from whatever source. Exceptional cases, where higher education would be advisable, can be easily provided for.\n\nI would like to see an experiment tried in this district; an experiment which, from its very nature, to be a success, would not be costly; a large measure of self-support being its very essence; and which should be a real benefit, not only to the pupils, but to the parents as well.\n\nIsland Lake would be an ideal place for this experiment. There are approximately 240 children between the ages of 7 and 16 years in this Band. Of these 35 attend Boarding Schools at Norway House, and about 140 were enrolled during 1933 as attending the Day Schools at Island Lake for varying periods. Our Island Lake people are very primitive in their ways, but are teachable and tractable. The majority of the men, and some of the women and children can and do read the Cree Syllabic in their bibles, hymn books and some church papers which reach them from time to time.\n\nThe natural resources of Island Lake are probably the best in this Agency. The cost of carrying goods into Island Lake is high. The population is large. Hence the necessity of developing these resources to the limit. On the islands in the lake, the timber is good, a considerable area of arable land could be found, almost any kind of vegetable or cereal of the North Temperate Zone.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nZone can be grown, fish abound in the lake. There is still a good supply of fur and game. There is abundance of water power at a short distance. The mines are still unproven.\n\nMy suggestion would be that a good location be chosen, preferably on an island, not too close to either reserve, where there would be a reasonable area of arable land, if possible also with sufficient timber for building purposes and for fuel for some years. Here experiments and tests might be made to determine the value and best means of developing and conserving the resources natural to Island Lake area. In this work the pupils would participate.\n\nThe school could be begun with very few pupils, boys, and the buildings be cottages or houses built largely of local material, and so constructed that they would serve as models for Indian homes, and some even for winter camp buildings. Some adaptations would, of course, be necessary. The academic work could be limited to a few hours per day, and instruction in, and practice of, building, carpentry, masonry, furniture making, skiff and boat building, clearing and cultivating the land, care of gardens and later of grains, fishing, care of nets, trapping, care of furs and skins, etc., and later, as the school developed, and it was found necessary, the care of horses, cows, pigs, poultry, etc., provided the growing of cereals was found practicable. Vacations could be taken during the best trapping seasons, or the supervisors could take boys trapping, to instruct in best trapping methods, and to supervise camp life.\n\nThe food could be limited, as far as possible, to that which could be grown and secured locally. This would be very important, as one of the chief objects of the school would be education in self-support. The value of deer, moose and rabbit skins as articles of clothing and bedding could be emphasized, as well as methods of keeping them clean.\n\nThe houses would have such conveniences as could be constructed locally, and of local materials. Furnishings could be largely of local construction. Fireplaces in the houses would be very natural and beneficial. Strict sanitary rules could be enforced. All of which could later be expected of graduates in their own homes, as being possible for them to make for themselves.\n\nI am of the opinion that such an experiment should be carried out by the Department, and not by either church. The sympathy and assistance of both the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches at Island Lake could and should be enlisted, and each church should look after the religious teaching of its own followers. The main principle, however, should be insisted on, that so far as possible, self-support be the basis and objective of the effort, and the rule of the school.\n\nA staff of about three men and one woman should be necessary in the beginning\u2014a Principal or Manager; a Carpenter and a fairly handy man for gardening, fishing, etc., and a cook. The cook might require an assistant for some time, until she could depend on the assistance of some of the boys. These staff members would, of course, require to be exceptional in character and zealous in performance.\n\nThe work could be enlarged gradually, by the building of\nof more houses, and by additions to the staff. If the boys' unit proved successful, a girls' school could later be established along similar lines, or whatever experience proved as best.\n\nI have tried to summarize my idea. Many details, of course, would require working out. Salaries and expenses would, of course, be met by the Department. A small sawmill would be very necessary. Later, if wheat growing proved successful, a small flour mill could be added.\n\nI am of the opinion, that with the proper management, and with proper support, such an undertaking would be a success in the best sense of the word. The selection and retaining of a proper staff would probably be one of the greatest difficulties to be met, as they would need to be of very exceptional character.\n\nI trust my suggestions may not be considered impertinent. My first essay in Indian work was in a school, a small Boarding School, which I think had a good reputation. Long years of experience, and close association with the schools convince me that our present system does not give satisfactory results among our Northern people. A desire for the improvement of conditions is my only object in presenting these suggestions for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nMarch 3, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Gordon:\n\nI read with a great deal of interest your letter of January 19th, containing observations on the educational problems of your Agency.\n\nIn this connection I may say that I recall very distinctly the opinions contained in a communication from you last year. The views you expressed have impressed me as being essentially sound. In the letter I have before me you set out the problems very clearly. At the moment I am not in a position to pass an opinion as to the feasibility of the measures you suggest as providing the solution for these problems. However, I can give you my assurance that what you say will be given very thorough consideration and you may also rest assured that any suggestions that you have made could not possibly be considered an impertinence in any sense of the word.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWilliam Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nManitoba.\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI have been informed that the present principal of the Norway House Residential School has been given notice that his services as principal will be no longer required. I am bound to say that at this occasion me regrets, and I take this opportunity to write you and express them.\n\nI have been connected with this school since 1927 as Medical Attendant, and today the general health of the pupils is better than ever before. Rev. Mr. Shoup has been paying particular attention to their health since his arrival, and has succeeded in his efforts to a marked degree. His first thought has been for the welfare of the children's health, and comparison with health standards before his arrival are decidedly favorable to his efforts.\n\nMr. Shoup has at all times given his whole-hearted cooperation in all matters relating to my work and suggestions; this was not the case before his arrival here. The diet of the children has undergone considerable change since his advent. This change of diet, or rather the study he has made of the present diet reflects itself in the health of the pupils. He has developed to a marked degree the gardens at the school and the vegetables have improved the children's health.\n\nMight I also point out that he has had to carry on his work with a substantial reduction of the Federal grants. In doing this, credit must be given him for his ability as a manager under extremely unfavorable circumstances. The ability of a man to carry on under the conditions with which he has had to contend, and at the same time present a favorable balance sheet, cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe children are far better clothed at the present time than at any time under another principal. He has also augmented the supply of cows, and developed the live stock end of the farming activities.\n\nIn conclusion, I must once more express my regrets at his dismissal and in this unsolicited letter give him credit for what in my estimation has been a worthy achievement. I must also state that I have found him at all times willing to cooperate in any way to better conditions that would add to the comfort and welfare of his pupils.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nW.N.

LETTER FOLLOWING.\n\nP. G. Lazenby.\nRef: 8-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 19th March last, I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School, but owing to the illness of the teacher of the junior pupils of the school, which are taught in conjunction with the Rossville Day School, I postponed making the report until her recovery and return to duty.\n\nI found everything inside the building in very good condition in every way. The dormitories were clean and orderly, and well aired. The bed clothing was also clean and in good condition.\n\nThe laundry was in good working order, all the machinery being in good condition.\n\nThe sewing room was clean and tidy. All the sewing machines are in good working order. The pupils are making good progress in this department, and becoming good needle workers.\n\nThe kitchen was clean and orderly in every way, and the work carried on in this department is efficient and systematic.\n\nThe pupils' dining room was in first class condition, perfectly clean and orderly. The meals served to the pupils are of good wholesome food, and they get a nice variety, always well prepared.\n\nIn the senior class room, under Mr Walter Mutch, the teacher, there were 25 pupils present, all of them being in grades 1 and 2, excepting only this one being a Grade VII pupil. The pupils were all clean and tidy. Their reports had improved slightly since my last inspection. I gave the pupils several mental arithmetic questions, which they answered fairly well. The book work generally was good, showing improvement had taken place. The register was marked up to date.\n\nTo-day, the 21st April, I inspected the junior class room of the residential school, which is conducted in amalgamation with the Rossville Indian Day School; the teacher being Miss Edythe Smith-Windsor. There are 46 residential school pupils on the roll, of whom there were 21 present at the time of my visit, which was in the morning. The balance of the pupils attend in the afternoon. The attendance of the residential school pupils averages about 40. There were 18 Day School pupils on the roll, of whom there were 8 present, the average of these pupils being about 10.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Both Day School and Residential School registers were marked up to date. The pupils' book work was generally very good; both writing ad figures being well ad neatly made, ad the arithmetic was generally accurate. With regard to the reading, the chief difficulty is getting the pupils to speak out so that they can be heard. These pupils of course are just young children, and no doubt they will improve in time.\n\nA new stove is needed in this school, and I would recommend that one be provided before next winter.\n\nThe Principal and staff of this residential school show keen interest in their work, and are continually seeking ways and means of making improvements wherever possible, and then making them. A staff meeting is held weekly, at which the various phases of the school work are discussed.\n\nI may also say that fire drill is carried out on an average of at least once a month.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

The teacher took the matter up with the Principal, and it was corrected.

During her delirium she imagined herself back in the Indian Boarding School at Norway House where she served as missionary-teacher under the United Church. Strangely enough, although she is a singularly successful high school teacher, she has never been able to shake off the lure of the North.... She is now on the safe road to recovery. At our every visit to the hospital she speaks of Norway House and \"the happiest years of my life,\" as she puts it. She was intensely fond of the Indian children largely for the reason that \"they have so little.\" Both of the Indian girls with whom she used to correspond have died of T.B., and the whites with whom she worked are no longer there. Your Department has undoubtedly records on file concerning the Norway House Institution, and I am wondering if you will be kind enough to supply certain information.....\n\nHow many classrooms are in operation there now for residential and day pupils? Is the principal of the school a \"reverend\" gentleman or a lay teacher? If my sister-in-law were to return to Indian work, would her earlier years of service as class teacher count toward pension? How many years of service are necessary to entitle a teacher of Indian children to pension according to Department regulations? (She has the idea that teachers of a strictly \"reserve\" school become eligible for pension and that qualified teachers doing similar work under church direction may miss it because their salaries are paid in the form of cheques from the Church Home Mission funds\u2014not in the form of an Indian Department cheque. I can not believe that a worker would be debarred from pension because of such a technicality.... Lastly, what is the approximate scale of remuneration at present for a highly qualified, professionally-trained teacher with successful experience?\n\nTHANKING YOU IN ANTICIPATION OF A REPLY,\n\nI AM,\n\nYOURS VERY TRULY,\n\nOAK EDUCATIONAL TEXTS,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal is Reverend R.T. Chapin.\n\nAt Indian Residential schools, the staff is engaged by the church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted. There is no system of superannuation for teachers in Indian day or residential schools. Salaries of teachers in Indian Day Schools depend on the size and location of the school. Salaries of teachers in residential schools are determined by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nL.C. Davison, Esq.,\nOak Educational Texts and Service,\n1056 McKay Street,\nMontreal, Quebec.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the morning of the 9th instant, I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School, and on the 12th instant, I paid a second visit to the class room, as the classes are not the same, morning and afternoon.\n\nSince the summer vacation, there have been one or two changes in the school staff. A new matron, named Mrs Lindsay, arrived by the last boat of the season from Winnipeg. A new class room teacher has also been installed, taking the place of Mr Meadows, who was the teacher last year. The new teacher's name is Mr Smith, and he was teacher at the Brandon Indian Residential School for one year before coming to Norway House. He has a 2nd Class Ontario teacher's certificate. A new sewing room teacher, named Miss Verla McDougald, has taken over the duties of the sewing room, held last year by Miss McCullough who is now duty officer. An extra man, named James Gilmour, who had been employed at the Alberni B.C. Indian Residential School, has also been taken on the staff.\n\nOn my visit to the school on the 9th instant, I found all the various departments in good order and clean in every way. The laundry is badly in need of a new washing machine. The present one will do well to last another year, as since the holidays, the wood work of this machine seems to be rotting very rapidly, and it is difficult to hold it together. The kitchen and pupils' dining room were both clean and in good order. All dormitories were also clean and in good order.\n\nThere were 54 pupils on the class room register, including grades 1 Junior to Grade 8. There were no grade 6 pupils. The average attendance in the class room since the holidays was approximately 47. There were 29 present at the time of my visit. The register was marked up to date. The book work of the pupils was well done, both as to neatness and accuracy. The pupils present were of grades 1 junior to grade 3.\n\nThere has been much sickness in the school during the past month or so, chiefly very severe colds. There were 3 cases of pneumonia. All these however, had made good recovery. There was one case of erysipelas in the school at the time of my visit.\n\nWhen I visited the school a second time, on the 12th instant, I went downstairs to see the high pressure boiler, which had not been operating when I visited the school.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nschool on the 9th instant. I found that this boiler was carrying a pressure of 60 lbs per square inch, and two Indian boys were in charge of it. One of these boys was probably 20 years of age; a graduate of the school, and employed there, named Hedley Ross. This boy, while no doubt a handy sort of boy in many ways, is not a qualified engineer, and in my opinion, should not be left in charge of this boiler. In connection with this matter, I beg to refer you to my inspection report regarding this school dated 28th October 1936, and the official letter of the Department, No: 123-5-5, dated 3rd December 1936 addressed to the Principal of the school, regarding the operation of the boiler. Mr R.L. Stevenson, a member of the school staff, has a 3rd class engineer's certificate, and should in my opinion, as I previously said, always be in direct charge of this boiler when it is in operation.\n\nThe pupils present on this afternoon, were of grades 4, 5, 7 and 8. There were 21 present. Their work was very creditable, both book work, and blackboard work. After recess every afternoon of the week except Tuesdays, the pupils of these grades are given 15 minutes of physical exercise, and on the afternoon of my visit, this exercise was very well done considering the short time they have been doing it, but no doubt improvement will come as they continue the exercises.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this report to Mr Inspector A.G. Hamilton for his information.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazebny,\nIndian Agent.\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department would appreciate your advising the number of milking cows at the Norway House Residential School at the present time. When were they tested and are you satisfied that they are free from bovine tuberculosis?\n\nIf you find it necessary to purchase milk for use at your school please let me know if this is secured from tuberculosis free herds.\n\nAn early reply to this letter would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R. T. Chapin, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that in the afternoon of the 29th November, I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nThere have been several changes in the school staff since the summer holidays. Mrs Lindsay, who had been the Matron, was compelled to leave owing to poor health, and her place has been filled by Mrs Carefoot. Miss Reed is now kitchen matron in place of Miss Forsyth who resigned; Miss Grace Mabber is now the boys' matron in place of Miss Anne Wright who resigned; and Miss Phyllis Martin is now duty officer.\n\nAt the time of my visit, all departments of the school were in good order, and quite clean and tidy. All the laundry machines have now been operated by electric motors since the installation of the new electric plant at the agency, in October last. This change, from the old belt drive from an overhead drive shaft, has greatly improved things, and eliminated a great deal of noise. All the dormitories were clean and in good order, as were also the kitchen and the pupils' dining room.\n\nThere were 61 pupils on the class room register, 26 of whom were present at the time of my visit. The register was marked up to date. There is an unusually large number of beginners this year, and these have had to be divided between the class room in the residential school, and the Rossville Indian Day School, as there are too many for one alone. The same teachers as last year were re-engaged, namely, Mr Alex Smith at the residential school, and Miss Edythe Smith-Windsor at the Rossville Day School. I found the pupils very attentive, at the residential school, and they are doing well at their work, especially the older ones.\n\nThe fire protection apparatus was in good condition. There was an outbreak of fire in the roof of the school on the 24th November, concerning which a special report has been forwarded. The slight damage done on that occasion has been repaired.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

I investigated the matter, and found that the boy's story had been greatly exaggerated, which he himself admitted. The boy willingly returned to the school. However, I recommended to the principal, that in no case should any form of punishment, however slight, be administered by a staff member, but all such cases should be dealt with by either the principal or the matron.\n\nP.

You will remember that you have already approved of the appointment of Mr. Chapin, who is now at Norway House, to the Brandon School in succession to Dr. Doyle who retires at the end of June next.\n\nOur Executive decided at its last meeting to recommend as the successor to Mr. Chapin at the Norway House School, Mr. A. E. Caldwell, who was, as you know, until recently the Principal of the Ahousat School in British Columbia. Since leaving Ahousat Mr. Caldwell has been in charge of our Kitamaat Mission up the Coast of the mainland of British Columbia.\n\nWe believe that Mr. Caldwell has the experience and the ability to make a successful Principal of Norway House, and also he knows the Indian quite thoroughly and has executive ability of quite a high order. We would like to have your approval of this nomination at the earliest possible moment. We think it might be wise to have Mr. Caldwell go to Norway House before Mr. Chapin leaves so that they might be together for at least a couple of weeks. Kitamaat, as you know, is somewhat isolated and there is only one boat a month so that Mr. Caldwell might have to leave Kitamaat at the end of March, if he is to have any time with Mr. Chapin before the latter leaves for Brandon.\n\nWith all the Season's Greetings and every good wish for the New Year, believe me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRBC:FMW\nOttawa,\nDecember 31, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant the Department approves the appointment of Mr. A.E.

Some men and boys from the residential school managed to save a few pieces of furniture from one of the ground floor rooms, but apart from these, everything was lost. A collection was taken up around the district the same afternoon, to assist the missionary to procure some immediately needed essentials.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nAttention of Mr. R. A.

We shall, of course, replace it. Nothing, however, can be done until the summer. The house was a very large building and was difficult to heat. Dr. Cormie and I were very favorably impressed with the house which your Department built for the Principal of the School, which is occupied by Mr. Chapin. In a letter Dr. Cormie suggests that we should try to erect that kind of a house for our missionary. I wonder if it would be possible for your Department to furnish us with the plans of this house. I may say that I am not unmindful of the fact that plans cost money, but if it were possible to have this set of plans, we might consider them, and, if they were found suitable and within our financial resources, we might use them without having new ones drawn.\n\nWould you be good enough to take up the matter with the proper person in your Department and let us know what can be done about it?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

T. Ferrier dated April 27, 1928, which read in part as follows:\n\n\"The blueprint of what we considered a suitable house for the money we have at our disposal has been sent by your architect to Mr. Blackford, the Principal, for his approval, with minor changes if so desired by the Principal.\"\n\nThe building was erected by day labour and it appears from the above quotation that the plan was sent to Mr. Blackford who was then Principal of the Norway House School. We have no record of this plan having been returned to this office. Possibly it is still in the school records at the Norway House Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo.

CALDWELL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nAugust 31st 1942.\n\nMrs. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt., of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been intending to write to you for some time reporting such progress as it has been possible to make in one year towards making this school a factor in the economic betterment of the Indian people, but I have had such a busy programme since the spring, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining suitable staff, that I have not had time. The matter of the inadequacy of our teaching arrangements at this school has already been given attention by the Department resulting in the material being supplied for new class-rooms, which material is now arriving. I feel that the addition of these class-rooms will do much to make the school an asset to the Indian territory it serves.\n\nIn reply to my letter of about a year ago re the employment of a vocational instructor, I was much struck with your remark that the residential schools serving our particular Indian territory were \"little more than charitable institutions\". This was the conclusion I had already arrived at. There can be no doubt that, if the residential school is to fulfill its function, its graduates should be equipped, both academically and practically, not only to be an influence on the reserve for better standards of living, but to provide for themselves a better livelihood. Not only has the Indian looked upon the residential school as a \"charitable institution\", but he has actually considered that he was conferring a favour on the school in giving us his children to feed and clothe and educate. The schools have been partially to blame for this impression, for the Indian has had little reason to think otherwise than that the function of the schools was simply to feed and clothe the children.\n\nI feel that these people must eventually be industrially assimilated, but in the meantime the process should be confined to such opportunity of industry as can be provided in their own environment. We must admit that these opportunities at present are actually insufficient to provide a livelihood, much less independence. It has, and will be, my endeavour to discover new methods of industry, such as can be carried on in their native environment.\n\nI have already, a year ago, approached the Hudson's Bay Company with a view to the employment of boys trained in the residential school in the permanent Hudson's Bay Service. The time of approach to this matter was opportune for the Company, with the result that an agreement has been reached, according to the terms of the attached letter. I have only had two boys who were at all suitably equipped to introduce into the Company service and these are doing very well in short apprenticeships at the local posts. However, I am anxious to take advantage of the agreement.\nMr. Hoey,\n\nturning out graduates who will make good in the Company service. This would have been impossible under the old system of class-room education employed here. With the engagement of two teachers this term and the full-day class-room instruction of the junior grades, I feel sure that we will be able to take advantage of the opening provided by the Company, not to as great an extent as could be desired for a few years, perhaps, as the system under which we conducted our class-room instruction for the past number of years has tended towards an extremely low academic standing. Further, it has been the desultory habit of the Indian parent to present a child for school admittance much beyond the minimum age, thus not giving either the school or the pupil much of a chance. I have, to a great extent, corrected this, with the result that most of our pupilage is now of junior age. However, although it will take some time for the results to show, I think, under the present system, we should have no difficulty in graduating most of our pupils with a grade 8 pass, as is found quite possible in British Columbia, even with the half-day class-room instruction for the junior grades.\n\nMay I ask you to note the age requirement referred to in paragraph 1 of the arrangements in Mr. Honley's letter. Although since coming here it has been my policy to adhere to the maximum age limit of 16 set by the Department, I presume the Department would be agreeable to extend this in the few instances required by the terms of the arrangement.\n\nApart from the new opportunities opened to the Indians by the establishment of supervised trapping areas, I think it possible that other means of industry might be discovered for them. I have this year been investigating the possibility of engaging in fish-meal production, from fish otherwise commercially useless. Fish-meal used to be considered a fertilizer by-product of the fish oil that has been extracted from the pilchards and herrings on the West Coast for years. Now, however, it has been discovered that this fish-meal has a high vitamin content and, as well as a fertilizer, it is used extensively for chicken and hog feeding. The present price of it F.O.B. Winnipeg from the Coast is $80.00 per ton. The labour is available here, the fish are available, the industry would be seasonal, probably just after the spring trapping season, and the machinery need not be elaborate or expensive. I was not quite prepared to bring this matter to the attention of the Department, as I had intended, but I am now given to understand that the Provincial Government would be interested in the venture and I have arranged to discuss it when next I am in Winnipeg. (You will appreciate also the great demand for the oil produced for paint.)\n\nWith the saw mill established here, there is possibility also in the manufacture of boxes from Poplar wood for the conveyance of fish caught on Lake Winnipeg. Thousands of these boxes are used yearly by the fishing companies. I have, however, in this regard, run into rather a snag in that the Selkirk box-factory has at present practically a monopoly. However, this outlet for Indian industry will still bear further examination.\n\nI wish to thank you for making possible the new class-room arrangement. I am not sure just when I will be able to complete the class-rooms. Much will depend on whether I can procure the furnace which is requisitioned for. However, I desire you to know that this innovation has prospect of enlarging the sphere of usefulness of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Caldwell,\n\nI was glad to hear from Mr. Bonnycastle on his return from a recent trip to Norway House that he had had an opportunity of discussing with you the employment of young Indian lads at our trading posts.\n\nYou may recall your discussion with the writer here last summer, when I outlined briefly the type of employee we want to get and what we are prepared to offer them.\n\nI understand from Mr. Bonnycastle that you would like some assurance from us that we can take a certain number of lads each year from your school. I suggest, therefore, for the present, that you count on us taking four each year under the following arrangements:\n\n1. The boys trained by you we would be prepared to take on at not less than 16 years of age, and preferably 17 or 18 if you are able to keep them in the school this long. I think your suggestion of selecting the likely recruits at 12 to 14 years of age\u2014well in advance of the time they would be employed\u2014is a good one since in this way you may be able to earmark them for special instruction. I believe Mr. Bonnycastle also discussed with you the advisability of giving employment during school holidays to these boys, but that you agreed it would be preferable they return to their families each summer until taken on permanently by the Company.\n\n2. With regard to the type of training these boys should receive while under your supervision:\n   (a) We should be glad if you could stress particularly good grounding in writing and arithmetic, as, in this way, they will be of greater use at a post, and be able to undertake more responsibility than simply doing chores and odd jobs around the store.\n   (b) It is also our intention to employ these lads at points which, because of their location or the size of the business, do not warrant the employment of white assistants. In these cases they must live in the same dwelling as the white manager; therefore, I think you should stress the importance of clean personal habits.\n   (c) Practical instruction in carpentry and mechanics is also valuable, if available in your curriculum.\n\nThe above remarks are intended to serve as an outline of the programme for the next twelve months when I consider the arrangements should be reviewed with yourself, Mr. Learmonth and the Saskatchewan District Manager, R.A. Talbot.\n\nMeanwhile, we are asking Mr. Learmonth to consult with you in the selection of two more boys to commence employment at Norway House and Rossville not later than 15th June. About freeze-up we should be ready to take on another two.\n\nI am very hopeful that this plan will work to our mutual advantage and that we may continue to take a few boys each year. Any criticisms or suggestions from you on the arrangements outlined here will be most welcome.\n\nYours faithfully, (J.W. Henley)\nPersonnel Manager.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is indeed refreshing and encouraging to receive a letter in which suggestions are made in respect to ways and means whereby Indians might become more self-reliant and more independent. Your suggestions in respect to fish meal production and the employment of young Indians by the Hudson's Bay Company appear to me to be particularly promising. In connection with the employment of Indian boys by the Hudson's Bay Company, you will, no doubt, select a number of the more promising boys for this work. Should you deem it desirable to retain such boys after they have reached the age of 16, you should send forward their names to the Department, together with your recommendation and a full explanation in each case.

George Dorsey\n\nCharge - Indian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, July 15, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWe have just received a letter dated July 5 from Indian Agent Goodman with regard to the arrangements that could be made for teaching services at Norway House during the academic year 1946-47. The Agent's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"(a) There are 2 buildings which could very easily be used as day schools. There is a senior classroom which is fully equipped and the same size as Rossville Day School and there is the gymnasium which is somewhat larger and would make an excellent day school. This would have to be equipped with blackboards, teacher's desk and chair and 40 single desks, 15 large, 10 medium and 15 small size.\n\n(b) These buildings (2) together with the present Rossville Day School should provide 3 day schools which would accommodate about 125 pupils. (c) These 3 buildings will not accommodate all the children of school age in this community but will accommodate more from this community than before the fire. It will be necessary to use the Principal's residence for living accommodation for the 3 teachers required for these schools, otherwise there is no accommodation here for them.\"\n\nYou will note that the Indian Agent suggests the use of the Principal's residence for the teachers. Will this building be available for this purpose or does Mr. Jones intend to remain at Norway House?\n\nIf living accommodation is available for the\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nActing Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street East,\nToronto 25, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 16, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY -\n\nRe-building of Norway House Residential School\n\nAs you requested, I interviewed Dr. Dorey about the above matter while in Toronto on August 14.\n\nI pointed out that Dr. Corrigan on a recent visit to your office had said that many of the children could be accommodated in a day school. Dr. Dorey said that this was true only at certain times of the year and that in the winter it was often impossible for them to reach school because of storms and ice on the lake.\n\nHe feels that the school should be rebuilt to provide for a pupilage of 150. I discussed the use of the old hospital building with him, but he felt that this would only accommodate some 40 children. He was of the opinion that we should not give up the land at the school site for use as a welfare building project, as proposed by Indian Agent Goodman.\n\nBernard F.

Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nProposed Indian Village at Roseville Point\n\nFurther to my letter 55-123 of August 5, I had an opportunity of discussing the Norway House educational problem at some length with Dr. Doray. It has been decided that the site which you have in mind for an Indian village will be retained as a reserved area for the intended rebuilding of the residential school. Before a firm decision is made on this rebuilding, it will be necessary to have our Educational Survey Officer visit your Agency and discuss your proposals at some length.\n\nI will expect to hear from you further as to another site for your proposed village.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 20, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nIt is our intention to include in our 1948-49 estimates, a sum for the erection of a Residential School at Norway House, Manitoba. The site for this school will be that previously used by the United Church for the operation of the former school which was destroyed by fire two years ago. You are requested to prepare the plans and specifications for these buildings.\n\nThe pupilage to be provided for at this school will be one hundred and twenty (60 boys and 60 girls). Due to the isolation of this school, it is felt that frame construction should be used but that the dormitories should be in separate buildings, in order to minimize the danger of fire.\n\nIt is recommended that this school consist of the following buildings:\n\n(1) Boys' Dormitory Block:\n   (a) Sleeping quarters for 60 boys\n   (b) Two staff rooms\n   (c) Wash rooms\n   (d) Recreation Room\n   (e) Manual Training Shop\n\nIt is suggested that this be a one-storey building with a full basement. The sleeping quarters, staff rooms and wash rooms could be on the main floor with the recreation room and manual training shop in the basement.\n(2) Girls' Dormitory Block:\n\nThe general planning for this building would be the same as for the boys' dormitory block. The exception would, of course, be the manual training room which, in this building, would be replaced by a domestic science room. This room should have extra electrical outlets provided for a power sewing machine and electric range.\n\n(3) Administration Building:\n\nThis would be a two storey building and would have a full basement. We would require the following rooms in this building:\n\n(a) Staff quarters for eight\n(b) Assembly Hall\n(c) Kitchen and dining-rooms\n(d) Wash rooms for use of school pupils and staff\n(e) Power House. (we are prepared to accept your recommendation that the power house should be located in a small building. It is felt that the whole unit should be steam heated from this power house).\n\n(4) Classroom Block:\n\nThis would be a standard four-room school previously designed by you for use at Eskasoni and Shubenacadie.\n\nIt is recommended that a meeting be held between your architects and our school officials to finalize the exact details of the buildings required.\n\nDirector.\nNorway House, Manitoba,\n9 September, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention Mr. B. F. Neary,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of August 27th 1946\nRe: Proposed Indian Village at Rossville.\n\nOur letters have, unfortunately, been crossing each\nother in the mail. I greatly regret your decision to disallow our\nrequested building site and I would ask you please to reconsider\nthe matter. The site is ideal for the purpose and is the only one\navailable on Rossville point. I have carefully examined the ground\nwhere it is proposed to erect the cottages. It is all rock and\nbush, rough ground, and has never been made use of by the school\nat any time except as a nuisance ground. It is fenced off from the\nrest of their property and its use as an Old Folks' Village would\nnot inconvenience the school even if it should be rebuilt on the\nsame site. The only piece of ground which is of value to the\nschool is the strip of ground requested for gardens for the cottages\nand this if need be we might be able to get along without.\n\nThis site was chosen and requested by the Chief and\nCouncil and they have their hearts set on it. If it is definitely\ndisallowed I may have to abandon the project altogether. I am\nhaving a tough time putting the scheme across in any event.\n\nA reply by wire, if possible, will be appreciated\nas the season is becoming late.\n\nI have assembled all the necessary building material\nexcept windows. These I am still trying to obtain. I need 64 and\nam willing to settle for any size.\n\nE. B.

W. W. SHOUP\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN. June 20, 1933.\n\nThe Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,.............Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWhen I returned from Winnipeg a few days ago I was handed my school report for the past Jan-Mar quarter with the information that they had been returned to him to have them completed up to Mar. 31st. This I have done and have again handed them to Indian Agent Mr. Gordon for approval. I am sorry that in forwarding the report last March that I overlooked to add a note of explanation as to the reason why we closed the report on Mar. 21st. A request had come to hand three years ago from the Board of Home Missions in Toronto to try to always have all reports in as nearly on time as possible, in order that there might be no undue delay in the forwarding of the Per Capita grants to the Board Rooms. Our spring mails over the ice are so uncertain that we have made it a practice this past three years to close the quarter on Mar. 31st and by so doing place the reports on the last mail before the ice breaks up. The last ten days of March we included in the April-June quarter. Did we not do so?\n\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nREV. W. W. SHOUP\nPRINCIPAL\n\n(2).\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\n\nthis the reports would have to lie here until our first summer mail in June. On other occasions I made a note of this fact on my report and it was always satisfactory to the Department. No doubt had I not overlooked the foot-note of explanation the reports would not have been returned. I would like however if you might see your way clear to direct me in this matter of the spring returns. We do not have any such difficulty with the reports of other quarters.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We would like to draw attention to the fact that no advance on December quarter has been received for this school due to the fact that when the advances were made the returns for the September quarter had not been received. The Principal was absent the latter part of September owing to his wife's illness. We would be glad to receive a cheque on account December quarter at your convenience. At this time of year we find financing these Schools in advance very difficult.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEB.\nProvince of: MANITOBA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended December 31st, 1936.\n\n| PRINCIPAL          | NAME OF SCHOOL     | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

The sum mentioned covers the school's share of the cost. It was necessary to also pay for the barrels used to transport the gasoline and there will, therefore, be a refund due the school of $974.40. As you are aware it will not be possible to return any barrels until navigation opens next spring but arrangements are being made to have the barrels returned next year considered as coming from the school. This will mean that a refund can be made as soon as payment is received from the company supplying the gasoline.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo.

As the Department does not pay for lighting at any Indian residential school nor for the wages of the man operating any lighting plant it is necessary for us to charge the $36.00 each month against the per capita grant and at the end of the quarter we have to deduct this amount from the quarterly earnings. This involves considerable bookkeeping and it would be much simpler if the management of the Norway House School would pay Duncan $36.00 a month and you could submit a voucher for the balance of $24.00 of which amount $9.00 is paid from Medical Vote and $15.00 from Administration Vote. Please take up this recommendation with the Principal of the Norway House School at once and I trust that he will co-operate with us in the manner suggested.\n\nIn 1938 I understand that two years' supply of gasoline was purchased and when the account was submitted the firm also charged for the barrels on the understanding, of course, that refund would be made for these when they were returned. Of the total amount charged for barrels the Department considered an amount of $974.40 applied to the Norway House School and this amount was deducted from their per capita grant. Subsequently we allowed them $152.00 for barrels.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nreturned. It would appear that they are still entitled to a refund of $824.40 provided the barrels have been sent back. I have made inquiries but we do not appear to have received any credits for barrels returned during the summer of 1939. Please let me know the number of barrels, if any, that were returned to the firm during last summer and also the approximate number of empty barrels on hand at the present time which no doubt you will return as soon as navigation opens. Possibly it is your intention to use these empty barrels to replace the barrels that will be required when a new supply of gasoline has to be ordered. In that event there would be no refund coming to the school.\n\nFor your information I may say that the following amounts will be deducted from the June quarter per capita earnings of the Norway House Residential School:\n\n| Voucher | Description                  | Amount |\n|---------|------------------------------|--------|\n| 412     | Alex Duncan's wages          | $36.00 |\n| 430     | Power & Mine -- supplies     | 1.02   |\n| 421     | Alex Duncan's wages          | $36.00 |\n| 447     | Oil and grease               | $59.49 |\n\nTotal $142.51\n\nIt is possible that before the June quarter return is received you will also have submitted a voucher for Duncan's wages for the month of June. In that event there will be another $36.00 deducted. It is hoped, however, as stated above, that the Principal will adopt our suggestion of the school paying its share directly to Duncan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr Phelan to write Norway House re payment of wages in operation of high i Power Plant.\n\nTo be deducted from June Dr. P.C.

We are now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Chapin in which he says that for the December quarter his aggregate attendance was 6271, his average attendance 69.9, and the grant earned $3935.12. I have written to Mr. Chapin, asking him if he can figure out what the difference is between the Department's figures and his. I should be glad, however, if you could help us to explain the discrepancy.\n\nRe - June Quarter\n\nIn my letter of December 17th, I included, amongst other matters, the following paragraph in regard to the grant for the June quarter:\n\n\"With further reference to the grant to the School for the June quarter, Mr. Chapin figured that it should have been $4237.37, whereas the amount received from the Department was $4094.76. This would look as if Mr. Duncan's salary for April and May, amounting to $72.00, as well as the $70.00 for repairs to the engines, was deducted from the grant for that quarter. Now, in the statement which came with your letter of November 5th, 1940, it is shown that Mr. Duncan's wages for April and May - $72.00 - were deducted from the September quarter grant. It would look as if a mistake had been made and that the deduction had been made twice - first in the June quarter and then in the September quarter. I should be glad if you would look into this matter and let me know whether or not Mr. Chapin is correct in his figuring.\"\n\nI have had no acknowledgment of or reply to this letter. I should be very glad, indeed, if you could forward us the explanation for which we asked.\n\nBelieve me, Very sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We had correspondence in regard to this matter some time ago while Mr. Chapin was Principal. We accepted your suggestion, I believe, that the School's share of the oil which is shipped to Norway House would be about $2,000 a year and that when a charge is made for drums there would be a refund in subsequent quarterly payments.\n\nMr. Caldwell's objection to the present method is that, under the present arrangement, the Department simply makes a deduction from the quarterly grant without letting us know how the amount is arrived at. It does seem to me quite a reasonable suggestion that, if this method of charging for the oil and drums is to be followed in the future, we should get an itemized statement telling us just how much is deducted for oil and how much for drums, and if refunds on account of drums returned are to be added to the quarterly grant, we ought to have a statement of these too.\n\nThere is a good deal to be said, too, for Mr. Caldwell's other suggestion, which would change the whole method of payment in this connection. Mr. Caldwell thinks that it would be fairer to have the full per capita grant paid quarterly to the School and then bill the School for the amount due for oil and drums, so that the School accounts would show the receipt of the full grant each quarter and the payment for oil and drums would also be recorded in the School accounts. It may be that this method would give the Department extra work and complicate the bookkeeping somewhat, but it does look to me to be the more businesslike way. It hardly seems fair that the School should have to wait sometimes for a considerable period before getting repayment on account of the drums.\n\nI should be glad if you would consider these suggestions and let me know if they are acceptable to the Department. I should also like to have an itemized statement showing how the amount paid on account of the June quarter grant is made up.\n\nBelieve me, very sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cost of the material is also in excess of the estimate submitted by the Principal, but it was evidently necessary to complete the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept.

Robinson for goods supplied for the Norway House Agency, and I have to request that you will kindly quote the authority for the purchase. The certificate on the voucher reads that the goods charged for are on hand for repairing I.B.S.* Among the articles charged for are flour, bacon, sugar and rubber boots. In view of the certificate these charges require explanation.\n\nI may add that there is a charge of $79.08 for freight and no receipt has been furnished in connection therewith. This is required.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian and\n\nWinnipeg\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier respecting the Norway House Boarding School, in which you will observe he expresses strongly the opinion as to repairs that \"it will be a total loss to put any more on the present building\", and that the only thing to do is to erect another one on a different site.\n\nI find that on the 22nd of March the Principal reported that the building had been extremely cold and all but uninhabitable during the winter; that in the office the thermometer would not average more than 15 degrees above zero, and that bacon left there was frozen so hard that it could not be cut with a knife. Yet from the 1st of November over 200 cords of wood had been used in an effort to heat the building. The Principal in his letter states \"it is really up to the Government or the Church to do something or close the school\".\n\nI find that in the estimates for 1906-7 $1000.00 was provided to \"drain basement, repair and paint new building\". I understand that certain expenditure has been made, but mainly in procuring material. In the estimates for the present year $500.00 is provided for certain repairs.\n\nUpon receiving Mr. Ferrier's letter of the 7th June, and reading that from the Principal already referred to, I concluded that it would be wise to have a report.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nreport from the Inspector before proceeding with expenditure upon a building declared to be so unfit for habitation. Mr. Semmens was then on his way to pay the annuity moneys, and I thought he would be able to make the report when on that trip. Unfortunately, however, he had to return by reason of illness. He is now on a trip on the Lakes, and I expect a report from him on his return in about two weeks.\n\nMr. Lousley interviewed me today in regard to the work, and I expressed the opinion to him that it would be better not to do anything until the Inspector's report was received and considered by the Department. He informs me that the building is on a rock in which there is a large cavity that fills with water, and that the sum available for the purpose from the amount voted would not at all meet the expenditure. He, like Mr. Ferrier, is absolutely convinced that there should be a new building on another site.\n\nThe present building was erected by the authorities of the Methodist Church, and is owned by them. You will observe in the concluding part of Mr. Ferrier's letter that he asks to be advised as to the amounts voted for the schools at Brandon, Red Deer, Morley, and Norway House. Am I to advise him of the provision made in the estimates as to any or all of these institutions, and authorize the expenditure?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n(Copy)\n\nIndustrial School,\nBrandon, Man., June 7, 1907.\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nLast year there was a grant of $1,000 made to improve the Boarding School at Norway House. I did not sanction the investment of any of this money inasmuch as I believe it will be a total loss to put any more in the present building. There is only one solution worthy of consideration, and that is to build another building on a different site. I should like you to find out what is the opinion of the Agent and the Inspector on this matter. My own judgment is that inasmuch as there were ten deaths in that school during the past nine months, a new building cannot be too soon on the way.\n\nWould you kindly let me know what grants have been made for Brandon, Red Deer, Morley and Norway House. An answer at your earliest convenience will greatly oblige,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) T. Ferrier.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing copy of a communication from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier calling attention to the unsanitary condition of the Boarding School building at Norway House and suggesting that a new one be put up on another site; and in reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier:\n\nI enclose herewith a statement of Finances of the Boarding School to end of June, 1907. The Government Report also goes out on this mail, it being the first mail since March 31st.\n\nYou will understand that the big deficit of this year is not due to carelessness or extravagance when I state that we opened school with sixty-five children and had to make provision for them all. That is fifteen for whom no Government grant was given. Then I cannot hold myself altogether responsible, that is, I am responsible, but do not condemn myself, because I am poorly served with dry goods. For example, I have on four occasions ordered heavy brown duck suits for the boys from Capt. Robinson and he, in spite of repeated protest, has sent me light canvas. These have come late in Fall when I could not exchange and I was compelled to use them and of course they only lasted a short time. Those heavy suits which you ordered for me and which did not arrive till last spring went to pieces like asbestos paper and are now after one winter's wear cast aside. Indeed, if we had not had others we could not have got through the winter in decent shape. My first order last summer for stocking webbing, most express emphasis being laid on quality and going so far as to say not to send anything but the best was rotten. I duplicated the order and half of it was rotten, and our supply and outfit of stockings now is a disgrace to the school. Considering these things I have felt compelled to have a good stock on hand.\nI hope you have been able to secure Government aid for the purchase of horses, harness, waggon, and a large freighting boat as these things are absolutely necessary to the management of this school through another year.\n\nI expect to be out in July to order drygoods and will try to see you then if you are not in.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Lousley.\nREPORT\nof the\nNORWAY HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL\nFor the year ending June 30, 1907.\n\nClass-room.--\nThere are two teachers, one for the Reserve and one for the Boarding School, and the children from the Boarding School and the Reserve are graded in classes according to their standing. The junior room is taught by the Reserve teacher and the senior room is taught by the Boarding School teacher. The plan works well and both schools are helped by the arrangement.\n\nBeing holiday time, I had no opportunity of seeing the work done nor examining the children.\n\nWhen the school closed June 29th there were fifty-four pupils in attendance.\n\nHealth of the Pupils.--\nThe year has been a long and trying one on the general health of the pupils and more deaths have occurred than in any previous year. Ten have died; nine of these were brought in last year, and nine died of consumption of the lungs or bowels, one of spinal meningitis. Only two of the deaths were of pupils from the Norway House Reserve.\n\nThe school started with sixty-five children, probably more than should have been in the dormitories considering the lack of ventilation.\n\nA hospital is a much needed institution so that afflicted children could be removed at once from the school.\nThe Staff and Salaries Paid.--\n\nPrincipal, $750.00, furnished house and table\nAssistant Principal, 300.00, board and washing,\nMatron, 300.00, \" \" \"\nCook, 216.00, \" \" \"\nSeamstress, 200.00, \" \" \"\nTeacher, 300.00, \" \" \"\n\nBuildings.--\n\nThe main building is kept clean but it is of such a finish that what is done does not show up to advantage. The floors on the ground flat are about worn out. The cellar and basements are in tumbledown condition and with about a foot of water in each and the only relief is in bailing it out with pails or pumping and at present the pump used is out of order. They are certainly very unsanitary and there must be a drain, which will be a very difficult task to be accomplished when we have to depend upon native help. Quicksand and rock will be encountered and it will need shoring up and it is next to impossible to get Indians to work at that kind of job.\n\nHeating and Ventilation.--\n\nThe furnaces are placed in these dilapidated basements which are merely holes in the ground and the way they are installed it is an impossibility to heat the building. The Department have made a vote of $100.00 to fix the furnaces. What is required are new furnaces, new basements, and new flues if the building is to be properly heated and ventilated, and nothing whatever can be done towards this end with so small an amount of money. I advised the Principal to get the consent of the Department to spend this $100.00 in box stoves and discard the furnaces altogether.\nThere are so many requirements for this building to make it what it ought to be that I have already reported that nothing but a new building will be a satisfactory solution of the problem.\n\nOther outbuildings.\u2014\n\nA good ice-house has been built and does good service in keeping milk, meats, etc.; a large woodshed, also, used for storing lumber and other supplies of a light nature; a root-house for keeping potatoes and vegetables but it is a difficult matter to keep it frost-proof; and a good warm stable that will accommodate ten head of cattle and a team of horses. There are eight head of cattle belonging to the school.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT\nof the\nNORWAY HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL\nFor the year ending June 30, 1907.\n\n----- RECEIPTS -----\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Missionary Society Grant                         | $5,500.00|\n| Special Grant for Salary                         | 150.00   |\n| Grant to paint Church & Mission House            | 150.00   |\n| \" for Balance of Church Repairs                  | 166.17   |\n| \" \" Interpreter                                   | 50.00    |\n| Goods sold to Missionaries and others            | 748.84   |\n| Government Grant for Repairs                     | 538.75   |\n| Deficit                                          | 3,394.10 |\n\n----- DISBURSEMENTS -----\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries                                         | $1,983.00|\n| Hardware, Oil & Lead, Light                       | 1,022.43 |\n| Dry Goods                                        | 1,647.56 |\n| Groceries & Provisions                            | 3,049.14 |\n| Boots & Shoes                                    | 468.63   |\n| Drugs & Stationery                                | 154.96   |\n| Building & Repairs                                | 722.81   |\n| Household Furnishings                             | 203.88   |\n| Freight and Transport                             | 1,050.82 |\n| Deficit last year                                 | 394.63   |\n\n$10,697.86 $10,697.86\nThere is about $1,200.00 worth of goods on hand, made up as follows:\n\nWood, $300.00\nHay, 75.00\nMoccasins and Leather, 270.00\nDry Goods 235.00\nAccounts to collect 320.00\n\nEnclosed find a letter from the Principal as to reason for the large deficit.\n\nHe applied to the Government for a grant for 65 children and was expecting that it would be granted.\n\nThe item of over $3,000 for provisions contains the only cash outlay for meat, fish, hay, wood, and moccasins, provisions being exchanged for these articles. The most of the goods sold have gone out of this account.\n\nThe freight and transportation account is high and cannot be controlled by the Principal. Freight rates from Selkirk were 40c. per 100 lbs. until this year, now 50c., and prices for goods and labor have been raised proportionately.\n\nSome help would be rendered by having a large amount of the goods purchased for him and landed at Selkirk in the month of June in time to ship on the barge that goes up to the mission as soon as navigation opens.\n\nUnder present conditions it will take at the very least $6,500 a year to maintain this school with 50 children.\n\nIt will be seen from Mr. Lousley's letter that a freighting boat, team of horses, harness and wagon are essential to manage the outside work. I have looked carefully into this and am of the opinion that the team, harness and wagon are an absolute necessity.\n\nAll the wood on the school property is done and neither the Government nor Indians will allow the supply to be cut from the Reserve so that a distance of 4 to 6\nmiles has to be travelled for fuel. Last year it took an average of 1\u00bd cords per day from November 15th to March 1st. The only time this wood can be hauled is over the ice and with the oxen it was an all-winter job and the oxen used so continually that they tired out on the journey and lay down on the road. It is impossible to get a supply ahead at the school. At present there are about ten cords, not enough to last until the ice is formed. The stock of wood now on hand is from four to five miles from the school. The horses and outfit are essential and should be sent up by boat so as to be there ready for use when the ice forms.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nEnc.\n\nNH\nIndustrial School,\nBrandon, Man., July 23, 1907.\n\nTo the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing you a brief report of the Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nYou will notice that there is a large deficit of $3,394.10. There have been smaller deficits that have occurred from year to year in connection with the handling of this school but the Church have paid up to the present.\n\nYou will also see by the report that a team of horses, harness, and wagon are about an absolute necessity. These ought to go up over the lake while navigation is open which is not likely to be after the 15th of September.\n\nAs this is such an urgent case and, I think, under the circumstances, a just expenditure on the part of the Department, I should like to have the authority to purchase these and send them up at the earliest date possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnc.\n\nNH\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 1)\nNorway House, July 19th, 1907.\n\nMr. J. A. J. McKenna,\nAsst. Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of July 11th, No. 122/78, would say that I have no written authority for that expenditure except as you see it mentioned in No. 122/78, April 9th last from Hon. David Laird. In that he says, \"But owing to your remote situation you may expend the balance this year\". That word \"balance\" refers to what is left of the $1000.00 mentioned there after this bill which I sent in has been paid. I received verbal instructions from the Commissioner while in Winnipeg last Fall, also from Rev. T. Ferrier, and was also informed by the Inspector, Rev. Jno. Semmens, of the grant made, all of which however came too late for me to get the work done last Fall. But the goods were ordered last Fall, and part of the work is already finished.\n\nAll work in this part has hitherto been paid for with groceries, drygoods, and hardware, etc., the Indians preferring it that way to any other. We never would be able to get work done at all if we had to follow the regular way of putting in vouchers for work done. These Indians would not, really could not, wait for it as they live daily from hand to mouth.\n\nI have a very wet muddy drain to dig, and anything but long rubber boots for the job would be useless, hence I ordered a few pair and will charge these on wages of men working at the draining.\n\nRe\nRe trading. All fuel for School, cutting and hauling, hay for stock, necessaries for children, meat, etc., in short, all that the Indian offers us which is useful in the School, we buy and pay for in this way.\n\nThis has all been discussed with the Commissioner and met with his approval, that is, I should say, was allowed to go on without further comment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) J. A. Lousley,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School,\nNorway House Agency,\n\" \" P.O.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th ultimo, with which you returned voucher No. 337 amounting to $538.75 in favor of Captain William Robinson for goods supplied for the Norway House Boarding School, you ask me to quote the authority for the expenditure, and also to explain the charges for flour, bacon, sugar, and rubber boots.\n\nThe Principal of the School was asked for explanations, and I forward copy of his reply, which, upon the whole, is not very satisfactory. I cannot find that I gave the Principal any written authority for the expenditure, and I do not remember that I gave him any verbal instructions. At the same time, as Rev. Mr. Ferrier, on the 17th of last August, and Mr. Inspector Semmens in his report on the School dated the 5th of last September, reported the urgent necessity of draining of the basement of the School, I may have mentioned to them and to the Principal that there was an item of $1000.00 in the estimates of 1906-7 \"to drain basement, repaint, and paint new building\". Indeed I see that I placed a marginal note on the Inspector's report that such a sum was available, and I understood the work was in progress.\n\nHowever, the material in Capt. Robinson's account appears to have been purchased for repairs to the School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSchool, and I would recommend it to be paid. The paint and oil are according to the vote for painting; the flour and bacon to pay the Indians while working at the basement; and the rubber boots for the workmen while standing in the water digging the drain. No receipt is necessary for the item of $79.08 for freight. Captain Wm. Robinson is the owner of the steamer that did the freighting, and he is the man forwarding the account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n(Copy)\n\nStonewall, Man., Sept. 7, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter No. 122/78 of the 11th. of June has for long lain in the Stonewall Office owing to my continued absence from home.\n\nIn reply to your request for a report upon the advisability of sanctioning the erection of a new building for the Norway House Boarding School, I wish to make some remarks.\n\n(I) In the summer of 1906 the Rev. Thompson Perrier called at my Pay Tent and asked me to accompany him to the Boarding School for the purpose of considering certain suggestions he had to make by way of improvements which he hoped with my recommendations the Government would provide for.\n\nI went with him and spent some time in discussing what appeared to be desirable. After mature consideration I recommended certain things as seen in my last special report totalling $1000.00 dollars. He has not been able to carry out the improvements to the great detriment of the school's health. He now says he \"does not sanction the investment of this money\". He was the one to ask for additional grant for improvements. He failed to use advantage afforded. He now covers up his failure by saying the building is not worth it. Why not have asked for a new School a year ago when he knew all he now knows concerning it.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nWinnipeg.\nHad the improvements which I suggested been carried out, I could easily have recommended that a further improvement which I had kept in reserve be provided for this year. You will see that the new part lately added to the rear must needs add to the warmth of that side of the building. Now if to this new siding with a thickness of tar paper had been placed south west and east the Building might have been serviceable for another five years. This was my idea which of course has not been realized.\n\nAs it is now the building is scarcely fit for use and the children are bound to suffer with cold, and this may result in much ill-health, as was the case last year. It is impossible to place a new building there during the present season. I now feel disposed to recommend that the school be suspended for a year, and that in the meantime an amount be placed in the estimates covering the cost of a new building to be erected on a new site.\n\nIn doing this I think that a representative of the Department should select the site and have authority to exercise supervision during the course of construction, and that the workmen should be sent out by the Department, that is to say the contract should be let to some responsible contractor, so that the work done should be guaranteed and the unfortunate failures noticeable in the first building be avoided.\n\nI know all this is radical enough, but it is not the fault of the officers of the Department that things are as they are, and yet responsibility remains largely with the Department and ill-health is likely to be charged against the Government by the general public, who do not understand how things have gone.\nI shall be glad to have a personal interview with you at any time, so as to reach the best conclusions and arrive at speedy and definite results.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) John Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th ultimo, in regard to the condition of the Boarding School building at Norway House, and the question of erecting a new one on another site, I beg to enclose herewith copy of Mr. Inspector Semmens' report on Rev. Mr. Ferrier's letter, and on the present defective state of the building, which is dangerous to the health of the pupils. The Methodist Church authorities are responsible for the shell of a building that was first erected; and the money expended thereon since appears to have done very little good.\n\nThe pressing question just now appears to be should the Department allow the school to remain open during the approaching winter? It is probable that the Principal has already laid in most of the food and clothing required for the winter; yet I am of opinion that unless the Church authorities strongly object, the school should be closed about the 1st of December.\n\nThe whole question of the cost of a new building is for the Department to consider.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 1)\nOttawa, September 28, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner has forwarded a report from Mr. Inspector Simmons on the condition of the boarding school building at Norway House, from which it appears that it is in such a delapidated condition that it is dangerous to the health of the pupils, and the Commissioner asks whether the Department should allow the school to remain open during the approaching winter.\n\nThe Methodist Church authorities are responsible for the shell of a building that was first erected, and what has been expended thereon since appears to have been thrown away. The Commissioner further remarks that it is probable the Principal has already laid in most of the food and clothing required for the winter, yet he gives it as his opinion that, unless the Church authorities strongly object, the school should be closed on or about December 1.\n\nMr. Perrier in speaking of the building says, \"The cellar and basements are in a tumble-down condition and with about a foot of water in each, and the only relief is in bailing it out with pails or pumping it out. There is no drain and it is in a most unsanitary condition. The furnaces are placed in these delapidated basements, which are merely holes in the ground, and the way they are installed makes it impossible to heat the buildings.\" He concludes by stating that...\nthat there are so many requirements for this building to make it what it ought to be that nothing but a new building will be a satisfactory solution of the problem.\n\nThere were ten deaths in the school last year, and if it is continued this winter this number is likely to be exceeded, as I find on March 23 the Principal reported to the Commissioner that in the office the thermometer would not average more than 15 degrees above zero and that bacon left there was frozen so hard that it could not be cut with a knife. Yet from November 1,200 cords of wood had been used in an effort to heat the building. He concluded his letter by stating that it was up to either the Government or the Church to do something or close the school.\n\nMr. Semmens in his report above referred to says that he feels disposed to recommend that the school be suspended for a year and that in the meantime an amount be placed in the estimate covering the cost of a new building to be erected on a new site. He remarks that this is radical enough, but it is not the Department's fault; yet responsibility lies largely with the Department, if the school is kept open, and ill-health is likely to be charged against the Government by the general public, who do not understand how things have gone.\n\nIn view of the dangerous condition of the building, which is a menace to the health of the pupils, I would suggest that the consent of the Methodist Church authorities be asked to close the school at the\nthe date recommended by the Commissioner and that in the meantime the question of rebuilding on a more suitable site be considered. The present premises are the property of the Methodist Church and are most unsuitable in every way for a school of this kind, and no doubt grave blame would attach to the Government if it was allowed to continue in its present condition. No expenditure would make the present site or buildings fit for the purpose for which they were intended.\n\nThis is only another instance of the want of foresight and common sense shown by the Churches in establishing schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In regard to the other accounts included in your statement, I have to say that these have not reached the Department, and I would advise you to communicate with Rev. T.

Paget\nAccountant.\n\nWood, Vallance Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J.T. Blackford, the Principal of Norway House Boarding School, enclosing copies of two accounts, which he states have been paid from the School Allotment. These accounts I attach.\n\nThe glass and lumber are articles which are chargeable to the Indian Department, as general repairs to School buildings, and Mr. Blackford is asking for a refund.\n\nThese goods were purchased by him when he first assumed charge of the School, for work which he considered urgent, and which could not be done while the children were absent on their holidays. Not having insisted in the regulations regarding purchases, and as he supposed the accounts should be paid from their general allotment, he failed to secure a list of competitive prices, or authority from the Indian Department for the purchases. He engages to follow the regular procedure in future.\n\nI may say that the material has been used economically and to the advantage of the School, the glass for repairing windows, the lumber, etc., for a partition in the office, part to be used for storeroom, thus releasing a good room for the accommodation of a member of the staff; part for completing the engineer's house, which is the property of the Department, and some for making closets for the clothing of the children.\n\nI have told Mr. Blackford that it would be necessary for him to secure receipts in triplicate for payment of these accounts.

T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist\nIndian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nBrandon, January 6th, 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed find an account from Wood Valence Limited for $23.96. This was for goods sent to the Indian Boarding School at Norway House which were required for the electric batteries. To the best of my knowledge the account is correct.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School.\nSir,\n\nReferring to my Estimates for this Agency for the year 1922-23, in my Estimates for Norway House Boarding School I asked for the construction of a silo.\n\nI would ask the Department to let me know at an early date if this will be allowed, as unless the silo is to be built, it would be useless to sow for sunflowers, since they are of little use except as silage.\n\nIf we were to sow sunflowers, we should know in time to order the seed before the mails over the ice cease. If ordered on the last mail, the seed could come in via the Hudson's Bay Railway and Cross Lake. The first boat up the Lake, reaching here about the beginning of June would be a little late, but this would depend largely upon the season.\n\nAs there is very little arable land here, and as milch cows are a necessity at the School, silage is the most profitable means of feeding. Sunflowers can be grown here without difficulty, and have proved themselves very satisfactory for silage. Hay costs here from $5.00 to $20.00 per ton. A silo would diminish the quantity of hay required by the School by 40 or 50 tons per year, or a saving in hay of a minimum of $600.00 per year. The work of cultivating the sunflower or corn, preferably the former, as the corn might be frozen, could all be done by the staff and pupils, to the advantage in experience of the pupils, and after the first outlay for silo and feed cutter, the cost would be negligible.\n\nOwing to the mail arrangements here, if a reply to this letter is to reach me in time to send out an order over the ice for seed, it would require an immediate answer. Our last outgoing mail leaves here Apr. 6th, so that a letter in order to reach me before that should reach Riverton at the latest about March 16th.\n\nMy suggestion re silo and stable was the building of an octagonal stable with a silo in the centre, which would reduce the cost, and make a building which would be very satisfactory for a windy country like this, and would also be very convenient. This, however, could be decided later.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 4th, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nReferring to the request of Agent Gordon hereunder regarding the construction of a silo at the Norway House Boarding School, I beg to say that we have provided an item of $3,000 in the estimates for the new fiscal year for the erection of a barn. I do not know whether this is sufficient to erect both a barn and a silo as we have no information as to the size of the barn required.\n\nIf, however, you consider that the above amount will cover the cost for both purposes, you should notify Agent Gordon to that effect as soon as possible so that he can arrange for the purchase of the sunflower seed.\n\nSee last paragraph of Agent's letter.\nOttawa, March 6, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th ult., with reference to the building of a silo and stable at the Norway House Boarding School, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to erect a silo for the use of this school during the coming summer. Before building operations are commenced, however, it will be necessary for you to furnish me with a rough sketch showing the accommodation required in the stable, and the size of the silo needed.\n\nWhen this information is received, plans will be prepared here for the work, and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

Blackford,\nPrincipal Norway House B.B. School,\nNorway House.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nNo. 413.\nDear Sir,\n\nLast fall certain purchases were made for material from the William Robinson Company, Ltd., and sent to Norway House. The vouchers passed through my hands and I certified to them being correct to the best of my knowledge. When I did so I was under the impression that all the material purchased was to be used in the main building, and in repairing the ice-house and stable. I have word from Mr. Blackford that some $300 or $400 was used to repair the large warehouse near the docks on mission property. This warehouse was built by the Methodist Church some years ago. It is used for a two-fold purpose. 1. To store goods the year around that are used in the boarding school. The car load of flour and feed that goes up in the fall is stored there and a great deal of this material was used to make a portion of the building mouse-proof. 2. During the summer months it is used for storing goods shipped in for missionaries inland, so that they can come and get it at their own convenience.\n\nI have also discovered that a small amount of the material was used to repair a house moved over from the mission property to the school property by the late principal and to be used by one of the employees of the school.\nNow that some of the material sent in has been used for these purposes mentioned, it may be said it has been used in the interests of the boarding school. I have explained the whole matter to your Inspector Mr. Bunn. If the Department does not approve of having this charged to the Government I will take the matter up next summer when I go out, finding out the exact amounts and a rebate can be made. In the meantime it might be well to communicate with Mr. Bunn who is quite familiar with all the buildings and their uses. If I find on investigation that any of this material has been used in the mission house, this will be adjusted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant with reference to purchases made last Fall of materials from the Willima Robertson Co., Ltd., for Norway House, I would ask that you look into this matter next Summer when you visit Norway House and advise me as to what portion of the materials were used other than for the Indian Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe principal of the Norway House Boarding School has called my attention to the walls of the Institution, which require to be kalsomined, and some painting around bases, burlap, etc. This would make a great difference in the appearance of the building, and make the rooms more sanitary. Some of the staff rooms and playrooms have been improved, but the balance of the building requires freshening.\n\nThis work could be done during the summer holidays, if the material were on hand. The material required would be as follows:\n\n- Alabastine, white, 3 cases.\n- \" cream, No.17, 2 \"\n- \" B, 15 2 \"\n- Paint, interior, cream 10 gal.\n- \" leather brown, 10 gal.\n\nIf this can be supplied, I would ask that it be purchased and forwarded by Inspector Bunn, so that it would reach here before the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, April 27th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Agent Gordon, Norway House, in which he recommends that a quantity of alabastine and paint be supplied for the use of the Norway House Boarding School. He states that some of the interior walls require to be kalsomined, and some painting is also required around the bases, burlap, etc., which would make a great difference in the appearance of the building, and make the rooms more sanitary. He also states that if the material were supplied, the work could be done during the summer holidays.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to purchase and have shipped to the school the following, viz:\n\n3 Cases Alabastine, White,\n2 \" \" Cream, #17,\n2 \" \" \" #15,\n10 Gals. Paint, Interior, Cream,\n10 \" \" \" Leather Brown.\n\nIn the purchase of the above, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nProperly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you covering the expenditure incurred, and a memorandum should be attached showing the quotations received.\n\nYou will be good enough to arrange for the forwarding of this material to the school in order that it will arrive before the end of June, so that the work can be done during the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n595 Broadway St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOTTAWA, April 27th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the kalsomining and painting required to the interior walls of the Norway House Boarding School, and giving an estimate of the material required to have the work done.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are authorizing Mr. Inspector Bunn to buy the quantity of alabastino and paint mentioned in your letter, and to arrange for the shipment of same to Norway House.\n\nIt is to be understood that the work of kalsomining and painting is to be carried out by the staff pupils without any expense to this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nTHE octagonal barn has advantages over both the oblong and the circular types, viz:\n\n1. Has all the advantages of the circular, yet easier to build.\n2. Maximum strength and minimum amount of outside wall surface.\n3. Freedom from snow drifts.\n4. Easy for ventilation, cleaning and feeding.\n5. No high gables to catch the wind.\n\nIn many cases it would be a great advantage to omit the space now devoted to loose stock, and to use that space for a silo.\n\nWith these points in its favor\u2014it should be a barn that will command itself and provide the owner who wishes to get the best results from his stock, with the best amount of labor.\n\nThe picture shows a driveway leading to the large loft, and is preferred in many cases, but this is entirely optional\u2014ordinary loft doors may be used if the driveway cannot be substituted.\n\nLOCATION AND FOUNDATION\u2014The foundation and location of the barn should be on high ground to permit good drainage. Barn drainage should always be away from the house. This is necessary both from the standpoint of health and cleanliness. Barn yards should be well drained.\n\nThe foundation walls should be made of cement or stone, and built up at least one foot above ground to prevent wood posts and planks rotting. Floors should be made of concrete, they should be clean and sanitary. Floors should be six or eight inches above the surrounding ground, and should be well drained by grading the entire length of the barn in a straight line and on a slant, to ensure dry stalls. The floors of the stalls should be overlaid with brick or cement stones.\n\nIt will be seen that there is accommodation for eight horses in four double stalls, and 16 cows in eight double stalls, besides which there are two large box stalls and stalls of ample size for loose stock.\n\nThe system of ventilation has been well proportioned, and the owner may rest assured that his barn will be dry, and that the cattle will be getting the maximum amount of sunshine and fresh air.\n\nWELL PREPARED PLANS MEAN ECONOMY OF COST IN BUILDING\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th ultimo, re building of stable and silo at Norway House Boarding School, would say that the size of stable required would be for 6 acres and 15 cows, with a couple of box stalls extra for emergencies and for any extra stock that might be on hand for a time.\n\nThe silo should be 14 ft. in diameter and 25 ft. high, or equivalent in storage capacity.\n\nI enclose a cut taken from the catalogue of Brown & Rutherfurd, of Winnipeg, which would accommodate a few more head than required here, but the plan of which, if it could be reduced somewhat would be satisfactory. The silo could be placed in the centre, where is shown the box for loose stock. One entrance might be used, the passage, for the cutting box and gasoline engine. If necessary, the silo could be made larger, and not so high. I think 50 ft. in diameter would be sufficient, providing the necessary accommodation and I think would work out correctly for passage, length of stalls, etc. I have not had the time to look these over carefully as I would wish, as our last mail, when the letter was received, was very late, and this is our last mail, out over the ice, no more outgoing mail until June.\n\nApplication to Brown & Rutherfurd would bring rough working sketches, and a Bill of the lumber required for the building shown in the enclosed.\n\nI had intended to enclose a rough sketch of this reduced to the suggested size, but could not get it finished for this mail.\n\nI trust, however, that from the information given, the Department can make the necessary plans, etc., and am hoping that not only the silo, but the stable as well will be completed this summer. Arrangements would have to be made early, as the season is short.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Aest. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nin my letter No.747-19A, of the 2nd Inst., I will only add that as milk is a very valuable article of diet in combating Tuberculosis, great care should be taken that cows providing milk for such a large Institution as this especially, should be kept in dry, warm, light and sanitary stables. Cold, damp, dark stables are veritable breeding places for germs, and, I understand, milk absorbs such germs very readily.\n\nI would therefore ask, on behalf of this School, sympathetic consideration of the above suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my report on Norway House Boarding School of even date, I would respectfully call attention to two or three matters which should be attended to this coming Summer if at all possible.\n\nThe rear foundation wall of the building heaves considerably with the frost, and is not only breaking up the concrete floor in the basement, but is separating the walls of the first story from the floor. There is at the present time a space of some three inches along the wall, between the wall and the floor. A reference to the plan of the building will show that on the East and on the west sides just close to the north end of each wall, a door was cut through, extending above the concrete wall, thus leaving the North or rear wall to stand alone, without any connection with the East and West walls, with the exception of the framework above. Owing to this heaving, the plaster is being cracked on walls several feet away from the North wall. Considerable damage has already been done, and unless something is done shortly, the north side of the building will be wrecked, and might even collapse.\n\nIn a letter dated June 20th last, No. 5A, I made a recommendation that the N.W. wing of the building be extended some 12 feet, with full basement wall, to protect the foundation wall of this wing, and to provide a very necessary additional space in the kitchen, which is too small for an Institution of this size, where girls are in training for cooking. This Winter the N.E. corner has also heaved, and as the Institution is in need of a roothouse, one could be put in at this point, where it would be convenient, and would protect the wall.\n\nFurther damage could be avoided by putting the wall below the frost line, or by putting in a wall outside of the present one, about two feet thick below the present wall to the frost line, and tapering into the present wall at the top. But this would be expensive with only one advantage, while the suggestions I have made, while more expensive, would protect the wall and give the additional space required.\n\nA second matter is the stables, for which, with a silo I included an sum in the Estimates. As I referred to these in\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.,\n15th April 1922.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 5th Inst., No. 825-49A written in reply to yours of March 6th, No. 123-5-5B re the erection of a silo and stable at the Norway House Boarding School this summer, would say that as I was somewhat hurried when writing said letter, I omitted two of the strongest arguments in favor of placing the silo inside of the stable. I note that users of silos in the west are now strongly advocating this, as the ensilage freezes in the very cold weather we have here, and is not only harder to get out of the silo, but must be thawed out before it is safe to feed it to stock. This would not be likely to occur in the enclosed silo. Then, too, the enclosed silo would be likely to last much longer than if exposed to the change of the weather.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

We would draw your attention to the three April invoices, which are still outstanding and overdue.\n\nWill you kindly remit to cover at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWOOD, VALLANCE LIMITED.\nMr. Scott,\n\nAn amount of $3,000.00 was included in this year's estimates for the erection of a barn in connection with the Norway House Indian Boarding School. This amount was not sufficient to construct the barn in accordance with the suggestions of the Reverend Principal. Reverend Mr. Perrier was communicated with and he suggests the building of the silo only, this year, the cost of which, complete, is approximately $1200.00.\n\nSilos are manufactured by different firms in the West all ready to be erected, the larger manufacture being the Radford-Wright Co. of Winnipeg, and I would recommend that Inspector Bunn be authorized to purchase a silo in a knock-down condition complete, and have it shipped to Norway House.\n\nA small quantity of cement will also be required and this could also be purchased by Mr. Bunn who would, of course, be instructed to obtain competitive prices.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of March 6th, No.123-545B in reference to the building of a silo at Norway House Boarding School, also a stable, and my replies of April 5th and April 8th, I would say that I have since received no information as to what action was taken by the Department.\n\nAs the season is now passing, and as navigation closes early in October, leaving only about three months for arrangements and for freighting, one boat only per week, if the work is to be done this season, arrangements should not be delayed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 6, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th ult., with reference to the silo required for the Norway House Indian Boarding School, I beg to say that Inspector Dunn has today been authorized to purchase a silo approximately 14' x 28' in a knock-down condition complete, also the necessary cement required for the foundation and floor.\n\nWhen the silo reaches Norway House, I would ask you to make arrangements for the erecting of same, and the building of the necessary foundation.\n\nIn employing the labour required, the time should be kept and sent in to the Department when forwarding the voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. Mclean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm.

Two tanks for rain water, and a drain for the overflow and to clear the furnace pitt could be installed for $500.\n\nAuthority should be given to the Principal and Agent to arrange for a change in the land surrender to straighten out the school property.

These however belong to plant and should properly be considered an expenditure over and above the per capita grant.

Inasmuch as a large number of repairs were necessary and the cost of maintenance for the year has been high, the Missionary Society of our Church have contributed about $7,000 for the year.

Ferrier\nPrincipal of the Brandon Industrial School.\nWinnipeg...15th August, 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI sent a \"night letter\" dated as above, which read as follows, I beg to confirm same now by letter.\n\n\"Principal Ferrier writes repairs to gasoline engines for pumping water and generating electricity at Norway House School will cost price of new engine.

Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of March 29th No. 123-5-5:\n\nI have just returned from a visit to Norway House and have looked into the matter of material that was purchased by the Department and used during the past fiscal year. I find that $325.00 worth of lumber, cement and wire netting was used to repair and make mouse-proof a large ware-house used for storing supplies. This ware-house was built and owned by the Methodist Church, during the time the old building was used as a boarding school. Fully 80% of the building is used for storing supplies used in the boarding school. The Principal of the school keeps the key and has full charge of everything that goes into the building. The remaining space of the building is used for storing goods off the steamer to be shipped further inland to our missionaries. Inasmuch as this building in the greater part of the boarding school I would suggest that the $325.00 which has been spent for repairs be contributed by the Department. I may say the Church has spent during the past year $400.00 for repairs on this building and on the house occupied by the mechanical instructor.\n\nIf the Department will grant this request we will be very grateful for the same.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School\n\nTF/GD\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHS\n\nGREAT NORTH WESTERN TELEGRAPH CO.

With this in mind we are asking Rev.

This will permit the principal to have the work well under way by the time the first boat reaches Norway House next spring.\n\nIt will be necessary, however, that you prepare rough plans and specifications of a suitable barn, and the contractor at Brandon should estimate roughly the quantities of cement and lumber that could be used to advantage by the principal before navigation opens in the spring. As intimated in my night letter, the Department will then give consideration to the purchase and shipment of these rough materials this fall.\n\nDuring the winter, the Department Architect will prepare proper plans and specifications from the rough sketches, and the work could be proceeded with next spring.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 4, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have, at Norway House, a building owned by the Methodist Church. This was formerly situated close to the church building. Rev. Mr. Denyes, former Principal, moved this building to another part of the reserve. There have been some Four or Five Hundred Dollars' worth of improvements made to it, and it is occupied by the mechanical man in the employ of the school.\n\nThis building should be on the school property and under the control of the Department. I would suggest that the principal be instructed to move it to a suitable site on the school property. For the expense of moving and some consideration for the value of the building, I would suggest the price of $500 to be paid by the Department. It would take at least $1500 to erect the building at the present time.\n\nThe Methodist Church also owns a school house that has been used for the Junior classroom of the boarding school. It is situated alongside of the reserve school. There are serious objections to sending the children of the boarding school out onto the reserve to play with the reserve children during intermission and other play hours. The building is in need of repairs. It should have new sills, should be lined up and made more comfortable, some repairs made to the windows and shingles, and removed to the school property. For these repairs and moving it will require about $500.\n\nI would like the sanction of the Department to move this building and make the needed repairs for the above sum. It would be quite satisfactory to the Church and the management of the school if these items were placed in the Estimates for the next Parliament, but, in the meantime, we would like the authority to move the building and make the repairs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 10, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 4th instant, referring to the engineer's cottage that has been placed on the Norway House Boarding School property. I have noted that this building is of considerable value and that the sum of $500 would be satisfactory to the Methodist Church Authorities.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that an item will be placed in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1923-24, and an effort will be made to reimburse you in this matter.\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter concerning the Junior Classroom of the Boarding School. I note that it should be moved onto the school property and that the cost in this connection and for necessary repairs will be in the neighborhood of $500.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department authorizes you to move this building and to make the repairs. Vouchers covering the labour and materials should be prepared and forwarded to the Department, in April, next. An item is being placed in the Estimates in connection with this, and favourable consideration will be given to the accounts when they are presented.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOTTAWA, October 10th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has been authorized to move the building that has been used for the junior classroom at the Norway House Boarding School onto the school property. This building is at present situated alongside of the reserve school, and there are serious objections to sending the children of the boarding school to attend classes in this building. An expenditure not exceeding $300 has been authorized for the purpose. Vouchers covering the labour and materials are to be forwarded to the Department in April, next, when funds will be provided for the purpose.\n\nYou may inform the Principal of the school accordingly, and, if he arranges to have the work done, he should keep proper time sheets of the labour employed, and in the purchase of any material competitive prices should be obtained.\n\nThe Principal will, no doubt, hear from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier in connection with this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Expenditures were as follows:- Lumber and other building material $1705.00 and a Silo $620.00. I believe that steel fixtures for the barn will be in the neighborhood of $700.00, making a total of $3025.00. Competitive prices have been secured, the materials have been shipped and I respectfully ask for authority to pay the accounts.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Paget,\n\nEducation cheque No. 2112, 1921-22 is for a payment of $1,800.76 to Wm. Robinson Co., Ltd., on account of lumber and hardware supplied for the boarding school at Norway House. This payment was supported by five accounts, four of which are as follows:\n\nNo. 1. Material supplied between Aug. 17 & Sept. 14th. $474.56\nNo. 2. \" on Aug. 30 & Sept. 1st. $348.82\nNo. 3. \" between Aug. 30 & Sept 13th. $465.32\nNo. 4. \" between Sept. 6th & 20th $257.56\n\nThe last four items in account No. 1, amounting to $7.32 correspond in every respect with the last four items but one in account No. 4.\n\nThe last four items in account No. 3 amounting to $196.54 are apparently the same as the first two, and sixth and seventh items in account No. 4.\n\nThe last four items in account No. 2, amounting to $25.50 are the same as the 3rd, 4th, and 5th items in account No. 4 with the exception of the date on which the goods were purchased.\n\nIt is quite apparent that in the first three cases, double payments have been made, while in the last case, there is a probability of a double payment.\n\nI shall be glad if you would have these accounts looked into and advise me of the result at your earliest opportunity.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nF.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\nOttawa, October 19th., 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI re-enclose herewith an account rendered at $237.66 dated 30th September which the Department received from your firm for supplies furnished for use at the Indian Boarding School at Norway House. Apparently all the charges in this account with the exception of the last item $5.30 were made in accounts previously presented, which accounts were paid by the Department. Figures in pencil have been made on the margin of the abovementioned account and they correspond with those on three other accounts dated respectively the 17th September, which are herewith returned to you.\n\nOn the 25th October 1921 the Department sent you cheque No. 2112 for $1800.76. The said cheque made payment of the following five accounts in which the above-mentioned account is included, namely,- $474.56, $346.82, $465.32, $274.40, and $237.66. Apparently an overpayment of $229.36 has been made to you and I have to request therefore that you will make refund to the Department of that amount and that you will at the same time return the vouchers herewith forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Robinson Company's account:\n\nI have taken this matter up with the company and find that this amount is a part of what I wrote the Department concerning on March 14th, 1922 and also on August 16th, 1922. The total amount overpaid was $325.96. The difference of $96.60 was paid from the funds of the Missionary Society. To correct the error the Wm. Robinson Company sent me a cheque in March last for $325.96. The reply to my letter to the Department of August 16th is dated September 2nd No. 123-5-5. By a reference to this you will see that the account has been settled.\n\nWhen I first took this matter up with the Department I was under the impression that the whole of the $325.96 had been paid by the Department but by the statement sent me by the Wm. Robinson Company I find it exactly as you have stated, viz., $229.36. In any case the whole amount was placed to the credit of the Boarding School at Norway House and the Wm. Robinson Company have settled the matter in full.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T. Harris]\n\nTF/GD\nOttawa, Nov. 8, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 3rd instant, regarding an overcharge of $229.36 in an account of Wm. Robinson Co., of Selkirk, Man., with the Norway House Boarding School. In your explanation, you have referred the Department to your letters of March 14th and August 16th, last, and our replies of this same file number, of March 29th and September 2nd.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, as far as the Department is concerned, these letters have reference to certain materials shipped to Norway House by the Wm. Robinson Co., that were used in the repairing and altering of the warehouse which is used by the school. The fact remains that there was an overpayment of $229.36 to the Wm. Robinson Co. for materials that were never supplied. The company has refunded this amount to the Norway House Boarding School, and the Auditor General requires that a cheque be made out to the Receiver General, in this connection.\n\nOur letter of September 2nd authorized the using of certain materials that had been supplied and has nothing to do with the overpayment.\n\nWe requested the Wm. Robinson Co., under date of the 9th ultimo, to return the vouchers forwarded them, and you might secure these and forward them to the Department when sending the cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Robinson Company's account: My understanding of this transaction is as follows:\n\nThe Wm. Robinson Company shipped goods to Norway House for the Indian Department and the Methodist Church in the fall of 1921 amounting to a total of $2,201.89. In November the Department sent a cheque for $1,800.76 and I sent cheques from the funds of the Missionary Society amounting to $27.09 making a total that the company received of $2,527.85. This was $325.96 too much and at the beginning of the New Year the company drew my attention to this fact and sent me a cheque for $325.96 to correct their error. I then wrote the Department in March concerning the matter and deposited the cheque in the Imperial Bank to the credit of the Norway House Boarding School. Later on I asked the Department to allow this amount to be left to the credit of the school on the grounds that the greater bulk of the material purchased by the Methodist Church was used in the ware-house. The only interpretation I placed on the Department's letter of September 2nd, No. 123-5-5 was that the request had been granted.\n\nIn my judgment there are two ways in which this error could have been corrected. 1. By having the Wm. Robinson Company render account to the Department for material charged to the Methodist Church to the amount of $229.36 with the understanding that the Department's cheque of $1800.76 included this amount. 2. By granting the Department's request in sending a cheque to the Receiver General for $229.36 and charging it to the Norway House Boarding School Account.\n\nAs per the Department's request herewith enclose the cheque. In doing so I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Department has contributed nothing to the repair of the ware-house.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF/GD\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Nov. 24, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a cheque in favour of the Receiver General for $229.36, being overpayment of the account of the William Robinson Company for goods shipped to Norway House in the fall of 1921.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith the Vouchers Nos. 447 & 448 in favor of Wood, Vallance Ltd., Winnipeg, for goods purchased by the Principal of Norway House Boarding School, authority for the purchase of which I understand, was given verbally to the Principal last August by the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nThe shafting and couplings were to permit of the change of position of a belt for driving some of the laundry machinery which belt ran across a doorway, and was unsafe. The pipes, elbows and wire were for the classroom.\n\nAs the School deals with Wood Vallance Lt. and is allowed wholesale prices, the Principal did not secure competitive prices.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn Sept. and Oct. last I received a shipment of lumber and building material which I understood was for the building of a new stable at Norway House Boarding School. I handed this over to the Principal of the School, as he had storage facilities and I had none.\n\nI find that the Principal has a plan for the stable and instructions from the Rev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon, to proceed with the building, and to get at least the foundations in this fall. The foundations have been put in and part of the frame erected.\n\nI may say that I have no objection to make to the building of the stable by the Principal, but would ask what my responsibility is in the matter. Naturally, as the Agent of the Indian Department here, I would expect to be responsible for the proper performance of work for which the Department pays, but since the plans and instructions have been sent to the Principal of the School, I presume he is to be held responsible, especially since I have received no intimation of any kind in this connection.\n\nAs to experience in building, I have in the past inspected considerable work for the Department, and think all such work has followed very closely the specifications laid down. If I am supposed to inspect this building, I would ask for a copy of the plans and specifications, also the conditions upon which it is being built.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\u2014\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 123-5-5 dated Oct. 10th, giving authority to move the building used as junior classroom for the Norway House Indian Boarding School to a location on the School property.\n\nI may say that I quite agree with the desirability of moving this building, but the serious objections to sending children of the Boarding School to this building for classes because of its situation beside the day school building evidences a change of heart in the Boarding School authorities, since when I came here in June 1921, it was necessary to keep a check on the number of children who were pupils of the Boarding School and who were being sent to classes in the Day School, sometimes to the detriment of the Day School pupils from the Reserve.\n\nI will endeavor to have the Principal prepare Vouchers in accordance with the Instructions of the Department, and will forward these in April next.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agency.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 23, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd ult., with reference to the building of a barn at the Norway House Indian Boarding School, I beg to say that the materials required for this barn were purchased last Fall on instructions from this Department, by Mr. Bunn, in order that they might be shipped to Norway House before navigation closed. This was done in order to have the materials available for the building of the barn early in the spring, before navigation opened.\n\nNo instructions were given to Mr. Ferrier or any one else for the erection of this building and the Department will not be responsible for the payment of labour which is undertaken without the authority of the Department.\n\nIt is the intention that the building be erected under your supervision, as early in the Spring as weather will permit, employing what labour is required and submitting regular time sheets covering the same, to the Department. If any additional material is required for this building, a requisition for same should be forwarded to the Department by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D.

Wood Vallance Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nThe following material is necessary for the Norway House Boarding School for repairs and alterations to the boundaries of the grounds as per agreement, and for the Class room and main building:\n\n- 200 rods 5 ft.9 strand, dog proof fence wire.\n- 2 wire gates, strong and 12 feet wide.\n- 2 \" \" \" \" 4 ft. wide.\n- 1 keg 1\u00bd\" wire staples.\n- 125 feet \"Hardware Cloth\"36\" wide, mesh 1x3 per lineal inch, for window protection.\n- 20 desks for Junior School. For pupils from 7 yrs. to 12 yrs. Double desks.\n- 1 Expenditure and Cash Book, for classifying expenditures, such as was in use a few years ago.\n\nI would recommend that these be supplied. The alteration of the boundaries will require the moving of some fence, and the construction of new. The old wire can be used for mending the balance of the fence. A good heavy wire and strongly and closely woven is needed. The gates will be required for the new fence. Those now in use will be used in sub-dividing the grounds. The wire for the windows are to protect the windows of the basement of the main building. The cost of broken glass in these windows for one season would almost pay for the wire. The desks in the class room have been there for years, and are practically everyone used up. Double desks are required. If these could come forward by the first coat, it would expedite the work of fencing in the grounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

The \"Hardware Cloth\" is required to protect the windows in the basement of the main building. We hope that you can arrange for the forwarding of the above material by the first boat.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the above purchases, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Study it. The more you know about it, the better you will like it. See Next Page for Full Description.\nDESCRIPTION OF HINGE\n\nRead This Carefully--It is Important.\n\nNo chain is stronger than its weakest link. Also the life of a school desk cannot be greater than the life of the hinge. In the development of the New Globe Automatic our energy was directed toward the elimination of faults in the Hinge.\n\nOUR SUCCESS IS COMPLETE\n\nWe sincerely believe that the Hinge in the New Automatic is the strongest Automatic Seat Hinge ever invented and comes nearer to being noiseless than any other now on the market.\n\nAbsolute noiselessness can only be secured by the use of rubber or leather buffers, or springs and when such parts are used it is only a question of time till they become worn or dislodged and must then be replaced or the desk is too noisy for further use.\n\nThose who have had experience in getting repairs for school desks know how difficult and unsatisfactory it is, and, therefore, the desk that will wear the longest without needing repairs is the most valuable one to the school.\n\nThere are fewer parts in the Hinge of the New Globe than are found in any other School Desk Hinge on the market. This alone reduces the possibility of its getting out of order.\n\nIt does not depend on bumpers or rubber, leather or other material, nor on springs of any kind for its noiseless action.\n\nThe steel balls used in the Hinge are one-half inch in diameter, being twice as large as those used by any other manufacturer, thus giving greater wear resisting qualities.\n\nThe balls in the Hinge of the New Globe ARE NOT held in position by means of springs, because when such is the case the spring will in time lose its tension allowing the balls to get out of their proper position, or drop out entirely.\n\nIn the Hinge of the New Globe the steel balls absorb all friction there being no wearing contact of iron against iron. In every other so-called Ball Bearing Desk there is a wearing contact of iron against iron.\n\nThe accompanying illustration, Fig. I, will give you a fairly accurate understanding of the great simplicity of the Hinge, and you will note that \"A\" is the Seat Arm; \"B\" shows a portion of the Desk Leg or Casting. When the Seat Arm is in its place, the Ball \"D\" fits into the socket \"O.\" The Shoulder \"R\" on \"A\" moves in Groove \"S\" on \"B\" when the seat is raised or lowered. Ball \"D\" rests in Socket in \"R,\" and runs along the inside of the Casting \"B\" at \"K,\" between \"P\" and \"K.\" The Casting grows gradually thicker as it nears the point \"K,\" so that the Ball runs less easily as it reaches the end of its course. This brings the seat to a gradual stop without jar or noise. When the seat is lowered the ball rolls towards \"J\" where the casting is also thicker. The seat comes to a gradual stop in the same way and for the same reason as when it is raised.\n\nThe office of the Bolt \"F\" and the Cap \"D\" is merely to hold the parts together. The bolt passes through the Seat Arm \"A\" in Slot \"G\" and through Casting \"B\" at \"H.\" The notch \"E\" Casting \"D\" is placed over the Lug \"C\" on \"B\" to prevent \"D\"s\" turning with the Seat Arm.\n\nThe Lugs \"L,\" \"M\" and \"N\" prevent the Seat from raising or lowering beyond the proper position and also carry a part of the weight of the pupil, thus relieving the working parts of some of the strain.\nNew Globe Adjustable Automatic Desks\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014ADJUSTABLE\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 or A | 3 or B | 5 or C |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Size of Top  | 23\u00bd x 16 | 20\u00bd x 14 | 17\u00bd x 12 |\n| Size of Book Box inside | 22 x 11 | 19 x 9\u00bd | 16 x 8 |\n| Range of Desk Adjustment | 26\u215b to 32\u00bc | 22\u215b to 27\u215b | 18\u215b to 24\u215b |\n| Range of Seat Adjustment | 13 to 18 | 11 to 15\u00bd | 9 to 13 |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 25 to 27 | 22 to 25 |\n| Ages Accommodated | 10 up | 6 to 11 | 4 to 7 |\n\nEvery part of our New Globe Automatic and New Globe Automatic Adjustable Desks is made of the very best material procurable of their respective kind.

No sliding in and out of this seat. Pupils do not slide into the aisle before they rise up as in other seats. Some manufacturers of the ordinary drop-up seats, to meet the demands for double desks, have added seats, have put in a centre leg to make the separate seats, for which they charge you from 50 to 75 per cent. extra, and which are no better than a double desk with one long or entire seat. Can you fold up these seats in the school room without getting into the aisle first? You might as well have their entire seat, for you cannot fold their double seat with separate seats; they are not practical. The convenience of this seat is acceptable in singing, breathing, reading or callisthenics, where a number of pupils are engaged simultaneously.\n\nOur arrangement virtually gives both occupants of a double desk a separate seat. Also more room with less floor space than any other desk made.\n\nWe also make a Double Desk with an Entire Seat which is less expensive.\n\nAutomatic Double Desk with Separate Seats\n\nOur New Desk Top Joint\n\nThis represents a section of the new joint we are now using on all of the backs, seats and tops of our desks. This is a new wedge dovetail joint\u2014the best in the world.\n\nGuard against trouble with joints of tops opening up by purchasing our school desks.\n\nAutomatic Double Desk with Entire Seat\nSizes and Dimensions of the B.

The cover is flush with the top of lid, and books, slates, etc., can be moved over the surface without noise or interruption.\n\nThe Shield\n\nWhile our desk is the strongest made, and needs no bracing, we decided to add strength where we knew it was required. The shield protects the seat in front from being marred or rubbed by the occupant of desk in rear. Boys cannot place a pin in their shoes and \"electrify\" the studious pupil in front, and neither can they fold the seat down when once up. The shield braces the desk latterly, supporting the castings where the leverage is the greatest when leaning against the side of the desk.\n\nThere is no uncertainty in dealing with us.

I shall be pleased to have a report and recommendation from you in this connection.\n\nMr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, purchased and shipped to Norway House some 42 spruce planks and a keg of nails, for the purpose of providing a protection for the intake pipe of the water supply at the edge of the lake. I have examined the files, and I regret to state that no instructions were sent to either you or the Rev. Principal in connection with this repair. I should be pleased if you would have this cribbing done during this coming summer and instruct the Principal to cover the ground and ice over the intake and piping near the lake with brush or other material, some time in the fall, so that the catch of snow will provide added protection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I believe all materials are on the ground and the work can be proceeded with at this time, under the supervision of our agent. Rev. T. Ferrier has requested that authority be given to enlarge the barn slightly so as to include the silo. He may have mentioned this to you when you met him in Toronto.\nOttawa, April 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official communication of the 23rd of January, last, in which you were authorized to supervise the building of the Norway House barn. If the frames and rafters are not already fixed in place and it is possible to make a slight change in the plans, without trouble or expense, I should be pleased if you would enlarge the barn slightly so as to have the walls surround the silo. It is considered that this will give added warmth and stability to this portion of the barn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm.

He mentions that the intake of the pipe has been broken off. This has probably been done by a dog. Inasmuch as the check valve was near the intake it is possible that this is the source of the trouble. I have been discussing the matter with Mr. Yates who put the pipe down. He would be quite willing to go to Norway House and see that the supply of water be again restored by the right connection.

With much labor, as the ground was frozen so hard, we opened the line at the connection with the Hospital line. Here we found the main pipe broken. We patched it up, and cut off the Hospital line, as we thought the trouble might be there. However, very little water could be pumped. We then opened the line just outside of the school fence, and found another break in the line. These breaks were not caused by frost, as they were straight round the pipes. I presume that when the line was laid, the bottom of the trench was not levelled, and when the weight of earth settled on the pipe the pipes were broken across at different points.\n\nWe patched up this break, but could still get no water, although the water would flow a good stream from the school to the intake. The pump is apparently all right, as it pumps from the reservoir against any pressure quite satisfactorily. Were the line frozen, the water and steam would not go down the pipe to the intake. For some time the water has pumped slowly, or sometimes in rushes, and almost always required a much longer time to get water than should have been necessary. I am of the opinion that there is something in the pipe which draws up against a connection or elbow, somewhere on the line, and stops the flow.\n\nI would recommend that this whole line be taken up this summer, and the line straightened, so that instead of four elbows as we have now, one would be sufficient, and that a 15 ft. would then box the pipe for the whole distance, filling the pit at the elbow with clean fresh fill material, and putting a union there so that the pipe could be disconnected and drawn if trouble occurred. By placing a cable in the box beside the pipe, fastened at intervals to the pipe, this could be done with blocks and cable in the basement of the school for the longer part of the trench.\n\nThe lumber required for boxing the line would be:\n- 4000 ft. of plank, 2\" x 10\"\n- 2400 ft. \" 2\" x 6\"\n- 1 keg nails, 4\"\n\nIt might be as cheap to secure new pipe as to excavate the old for the greater part of the length. There will be 1100 feet of pipe line to be boxed, and this quantity of 3\" pipe would be sufficient.\n\nDonald McKay, the Agency teamster, and the Agency team have been busy practically every work day since April 23rd hauling water for the School. I have found it difficult to get the team to do work for the Agency. I have found it necessary to purchase extra feed for the team, and altogether it is expensive to provide water in this way. If a good ditching machine could be secured for a time, that might be the least expensive way of making the excavation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The silo was two feet larger than shown in the plan, and made the box stalls shown very small. The passage behind the horses was too narrow. Very little additional material will be required on this account, and the stable will be more satisfactory.

Paget\nAccountant.\n\nThe Manager,\nBank of Montreal,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. Runn,\n\nRe the School pipe line, the following is a copy of a letter which I sent to the Secretary June 11th. You will observe that I recommended an entirely new line, laid as nearly straight as possible and boxed. This, I think, is feasible, but if the decision is to repair the old line, the following would be required:\n\n- 6 three inch galv. pipe, 1 doz. 3\" pipe connections,\n- 6 \" \" \" Unions, 3 only 2\" unions.\n\nI regret to have to inform you that about the first of March last the water line to the school began giving considerable trouble. With much labor, as the ground was frozen so hard, we opened the line at the connection with the hospital line. Here we found the main pipe broken. We patched it up and cut off the hospital line, as we thought the trouble might be there. However, very little water could be pumped. We then opened the line just outside of the school fence, and found another break in the line. These breaks were not caused by frost, as they were straight round the pipes.

By placing a cable in the box beside the pipe, fastened at intervals to the pipe, this could be done with blocks and cable in the basement of the school for the longest part of the trench.\n\nThe lumber required for boxing the line would be:\n- 4000 ft. plank, 2\" X 10\"\n- 2400 ft. 2\" X 6\"\n\nIt might be as cheap to secure new pipe as to excavate the old for the greater part of the length. 7\" pipe. There would be 1100 ft. of pipe line to be boxed, and this quantity of pipe would be sufficient.\n\nDonald McKay, the Agency teamster and the Agency team have been busy practically every work day since April 23rd hauling water for the school. I have found it difficult to get the team to do work for the Agency. I have found it necessary to purchase extra feed for the team, and altogether it is expensive to provide water in this way.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYou have here then my opinion as expressed to the Department. To put in the new line as suggested would cost about $1200, or perhaps a little more, depending upon what obstacles were encountered. To repair the old line makes the cost very problematical, but would be probably about $500. The new line as suggested should be a pretty permanent and trouble proof arrangement; the old line would be sure to give more or less trouble always, and is difficult to repair in winter, especially.\n\nIf it is the decision of the Department to repair the old line, I can get men to do the digging almost any time now as work is scarce. Of course little can be done until all material is on hand, as the ground here caves in very badly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nWinnipeg, 17th July, 1923.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter number and date as given above, I sent the following wireless message: (to Wm.

I asked for a reply on the 13th and was informed that the reply was un-readable, and that a letter was coming from Mr. Gordon. This accounts for the delay in communicating with you.\n\nYesterday the enclosed letter came to hand, and I am sending it for your information. I was in the St. Peter's Hay Lands all of the 16th, so could not reply sooner.\n\nI judge from Mr. Gordon's letter that the pipe line must be in bad shape, and in my judgement it would appear that the best action to take to remedy the situation would be to replace the whole line, if this is done in a proper manner than the problem is solved, the line is all new and will hold together better and give better service.\n\nPatching the old line would be too risky, the old portions left in would surely give trouble.\n\nThe materials required should be on the ground as soon as possible, so that the work would be done in better shape.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nReverend T.

I am of the opinion that any attempt to repair the present pipe might prove disappointing. Personally I believe the frost reached it at various points during last winter, insomuch as one serious break is under the pathway where there is heavy tracking right at the front gate. It is to be noted that when this pipe was put in we had little hope of ever making it frost proof as the report of the Department's engineer from Portage la Prairie was that a large amount of blasting would have to be done to make a frost proof connection to any point at the lake. We followed what we believed to be a line as free as possible from rock in putting down the present piping, and consequently the line is not straight. I think Mr. Gordon's report on the best method to pursue is to put in a new connection rather than to try and repair the present one, and to make as straight a line as possible from the pump to the point where it has to turn to the lake. This is in the neighborhood of 1100 feet. He also proposes to box the pipe in a wooden case made of 2 inch plank. I believe this will make a permanent job and will probably prove the only satisfactory solution of the problem.\n\nThis ought to be done with all possible speed as the season is very short in that north land. The supply of water ought to be on hand when the school opens after the summer vacation. There are some other repairs necessary to the furnace and the plumbing system and as Mr. Yates of Brandon understands the situation thoroughly I would like if it could be arranged for him to do the work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is blocked up, and will need to be opened and the obstruction removed. The septic tank has been there nine years, and has never been cleaned since it was put in. It would be advisable to have it cleaned.\n\nThe other matter was the cementing of the stable floor. Mr. Blackford is removing the old stable, and putting up a new structure out of the old material to be used as a hog pen. He will need about 25 barrels of cement. Would the Department kindly authorize these repairs and the necessary expenditure.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When passing through Winnipeg on my way from Norway House I called on Mr. Bunn and discussed all these matters with him. I also requested that Mr. Yates of Brandon be engaged to carry out the work. I would be pleased if this could be sanctioned by the Department. Mr. Yates is quite familiar with the plumbing and furnaces, and the entire pipeline. I feel sure he will do the work as well as any man that could be sent. The fact that his work gave satisfaction for four years is proof sufficient that the break in the pipe was not due to any fault in the workmanship.\n\nAs time is an element in this, an early decision is desirable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 10 A of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a requisition for certain equipment, required at the Norway House Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that authority cannot be given for the three door checks nor for the window glass. The last mentioned material should be purchased from per capita grant. You are authorized to arrange for the purchase of 3 closet bowls, 1 water column, 2 sets of furnace grates, 4 sheets of galvanized iron and 1 roll of asbestos paper, as mentioned in the enclosure with your letter.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon, has brought to our attention the desirability of cleaning the septic tank and removing the obstruction in the drain leading to the lake. You are authorized to have the drain opened up, the obstruction removed and the septic tank cleaned. Proper time sheets should be kept in connection with the labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nOttawa, August 13, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, in which you intimate that you have discussed with Mr. Inspector Bunn the laying of a new pipe line for the water supply at the Norway House Indian Boarding School.\n\nAs you were informed in official communication of the 3rd instant, Mr. Inspector Bunn was authorized, by telegram, to arrange for the installation of a new pipe line. It is considered by the Department that this work can be satisfactorily done by local labour, under the supervision of Mr. Indian Agent Gordon. If you are of the opinion that Mr. Inspector Bunn has not already taken action, in accordance with the Department's intention, you would do well to communicate with him without delay, for the purpose of advising him that it is not our wish to engage and send to Norway House a plumber for this purpose.\n\nI have also your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the condition of the septic tank and the drain at the Norway House Indian Boarding School. I have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Gordon has been instructed to open the drain, remove the obstruction and clean the septic tank. This will be done by day labour, under the supervision of our agent. With reference to the supplying of 25 bbls. of cement for the floor of the hog pen, I regret to inform you that this cannot be authorized at the present time. The funds at the disposal of the Department, for repairs to the Norway House Indian Boarding School, have already been assigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Have you sent funds and on what date.\"\n\nOn the 25th August I asked for $900.00 to be wired for Mr. Gordon to pay wages on the new pipe line work. I shipped all the necessary material for the work, and I figured that I had completed the arrangement fully.\n\nWhen I got the wire today, I immediately went over to the Bank of Montreal and made inquiry. I was shown that $900.00 stood at the credit of \"J.L. Bunn,\" and still stands there. Mr. Gordon did not ask me about this, and I presumed he had received from the bank direct. I do not understand why he should have allowed the matter to remain as it is, if he had inquired of me. In turn would certainly have asked the Department and I would have been put wise to the whole situation, and fixed it.\n\nThe first mail to Norway House goes on the 26th Nov., coming, I can send it out then safely I think.\n\nI tried to get Norway House this afternoon by wireless but that is out for the season. I intended to ask the H.B.C. to hand Mr. Gordon $900.00 and I could have paid the same amount in here.\n\nI think Mr. Gordon should make why he deferred asking about these funds which were for payment of wages.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nNote. The Bank did not notify me about this matter, the name being J.L. Bunn.\nOttawa, October 29th., 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th instant, relative to the sum of $900.00 wired on the 25th August last to the Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg, for your credit, I beg to state that the Department regrets the misunderstanding and delay which have caused inconvenience to Mr. Agent Gordon. It is considered that the Bank should have notified you, but on the other hand as you had asked that the money be wired to you, you should have made enquiries and followed the matter up. You should now ask the Bank to send the money to Mr. Gordon by the first winter mail, registered and insured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the new waterline for the Norway House Boarding School has been completed, so far as can be done this fall, with the exception of a little work still to be done on the intake crib.\n\nNext spring there will be some concrete floor and walk to be replaced, but it is better to leave that work until spring, as by that time the earth that has been replaced in the trench will have settled thoroughly.\n\nBy straightening the line, we have eliminated four elbows, which should reduce the friction in pumping considerably. There is now only one elbow between the building and the lake, and four within the building, to the pump. We have put in a tee for connection with the Hospital and Agency buildings, and a check valve just above this in each line. The minimum depth of the ditch is 7 feet, and the pipe is boxed with two inch planking, so that there should be no trouble from frost. Manholes and unions were put in at the Hospital connection and at the only outside elbow.\n\nWe met with some rock, which had to be blasted, and which added to the cost of the work considerably.\n\nI have had to disconnect the Agency line from the main, as the only check valve I had of the proper size was found to leak. This, however, will be no hardship this winter, as the only pump I have is of little use. When the new Hospital is built, proper connection will require to be put in, and a good pump supplied.\n\nThe water now comes to the school quickly and satisfactorily, and I think this line should give good satisfaction for years to come.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.123-5-5 of Aug.13th, in which you advised me to have the discharge line from the septic tank of the sewage system of the Norway House Indian Boarding School taken up and cleaned and replaced, I would say that while I thought the stoppage could be located without this amount of work and expense, I did as instructed, and found two stoppages in the pipe. This I did in connection with the work on the waterline, the work being done by the same men, and I did not keep the accounts separate. Unfortunately, the tile had been cemented together when placed in the trench, rather unnecessarily, I think in the outlet pipe, and it was impossible to take them out without breaking many of the tile. These I replaced with some of the same size, 6\", which I had on hand for the purpose of putting in a separate sewer service for the Hospital.\n\nFrom the surface of the second chamber we took some of the solid matter, but decided, since there was no evidence of the tank not discharging the contents steadily and as the odor was so offensive, this could better be done in colder weather. The presence of the solid matter in the second chamber was due to the stoppage in the outlet pipe, which caused the surface of the contents of the tank to rise above the dividing partition. For some reason, probably the presence of large quantities of soap and water, and possibly some disinfectants also in the sewage, the bacteria is not sufficiently active to keep the solid matter reduced.\n\nThe discharge pipe was replaced without cement, and the tank is working well, the contents remaining at the level of the discharge opening.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have to report that the new stable at the Norway House Indian Boarding School has been completed, with the exception of the painting of a portion of the roof, the cowlings of the ventilators, and some other touching up of parts recently finished. The additional paint was not received in time to do this work properly, as we were having frosts at night which kept the shingles damp for the greater part of the day. A portion of the track for the litter carrier was not put up, as we were some 25 feet short of track and brackets. I asked for 110 ft. of track, and received only 84 ft. I am writing Mr. Inspector Bunn re this as the balance may have been ordered and lost in transit. Tavetroughing also was not received. I trust this will be supplied, as it will protect the foundations from injury as otherwise the water will get under the wall, and the frosts will heave and disturb the building. The electric fixtures also did not arrive, but the school had some extra fixtures, for repair work, and these were used for a temporary system.\n\nAs the Department authorized the extension of the stable to enclose the silo, vide letter No. 123-5-5, of Apr. 26th last, which letter was not received here until June, when the building was too far advanced to make so great a change, I took the liberty of making a small addition to the east end of the barn. This addition is 9' x 19', with 14' wall, and lean-to roof to end of barn and silo. The foundation and floor is solid, and the ensilage cutter is fastened to the concrete. A wide door is left, so that the machine can be fed with no inconvenience. A trap in the roof permits the passage of the blower pipe, and a small doorway in the side makes way for the belt from the engine. This addition furnishes some storage room for small tools, etc., for the ensilage cutter, and protects the silo to some extent against frost. Almost all of the material used in this addition was surplus from the stable, the extra being cement, nails and labor.\n\nA grain box was built in the hay loft above the horses, with a chute down into the horse stable. A large feed chute was built from the floor of the loft to nearly the roof to keep the hay away from the doors of the silo. A door opens from this to the hay loft. Good mangers were made for the horses, with a sloping bottom, and sufficient opening to permit all waste to slide out beneath the feet of the horses. Feed chutes were put in between the stalls, so that the horses eat from the sides of these. This should prevent considerable wastage of feed.\n\nThe stable was floored with concrete throughout, and has a deep base of stones and pebbles with some sand. There should be no shelling off or breaking of this floor for many years. Plank were put on top of the concrete for the horse stables. The water has been connected from the school system.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe ventilation system appears to work well; we will be better able to judge of this when colder weather comes. A cold air pipe comes from above the roof to about one foot above the floor, in the passage in front of the cattle. Just across the passage a warm air pipe for the foul air extends from the ceiling through the roof. Each has a cupola above the roof. The low walls of the feed passage, about 30 inches, protect the stock from getting the cold air too direct from the pipe. These pipes can be checked if necessary. The windows are also made to open inward at the top, so as to leave an opening of about four inches and the width of the window, and deflecting this entering air upward.\n\nAt one side of the silo is a good box stall, at the other a stall which will accommodate four calves or some young stock. Besides these, there is accommodation for sixteen head of cattle, and six horses.\n\nI may say that this stable is a very fine structure, and a credit to the Department and a splendid addition to the working plant of the School. The Principal of the School has requested me to convey to the Department his appreciation of their kindness in building such an excellent barn for the school.\n\nI may also say that the building reflects credit on the quality of education being given in the Schools, as the work was all done by Indian men who are graduates of the schools. The foreman on the work throughout, concrete, carpenter work, and painting, was Joe Keeper, a member of the Norway House Band and a graduate of some years ago of the Brandon School.\n\nI also appreciate very highly the willingness of the Department to give us for our schools the very best possible in the way of plant, and I have personally given considerable time and thought to this building, to have the maximum of stability and convenience, with the minimum of expense. The contrast between the new stable and the old is very great. The Instructors will now be in a position to teach the boys how horses and cattle should be cared for.\n\nThe old buildings have been removed, and the material that could be used has been used in chicken house and hog pen, and hog shelters in the outdoor pen. The ground about the new stable has been graded and levelled, and the improvement in the appearance of the school property is very considerable.\n\nI will endeavor to secure the balance of the accounts due for labor, and forward them as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm.

These were purchased by Inspector Funn and sent forward. Unfortunately they were found to be too small and of insufficient strength for the large doors for which they were intended. They were used on other doors to good advantage. Consequently the large doors referred to were left without checks. This is a windy country, and unless caught securely, doors slam with violence, and become broken. The Principal purchased these when in the city last fall. While the purchase under the circumstances was irregular, it was made in the interests of the property of the Department, as it is impossible to save these doors unless they are safeguarded by checks.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

You may, without further authority, arrange for the purchase of the materials necessary for the hen house and you may engage a competent carpenter, if necessary, to assist the school staff and older boys with the work. If labour is engaged, proper time sheets in duplicate should be kept and should show the receipts of the man employed. You will please secure competitive prices for the materials to be purchased and when submitting a properly certified account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, you should support it with an Abstract of Tender form showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.

It may be that some government department will have a boat of this kind surplus to their requirements and that it could be transferred to Indian Affairs. If a boat is available any great distance from Selkirk, Man., where it would have to be unloaded, it should be in good condition or transfer would be unwarranted because of the heavy freight charges.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

In reply I have to inform you that the Department got in touch with the Government Contracts Supervision Committee, as soon as your telegram was received, and it was learned that this boat had been sold. The purchase price of $300 indicates that the value of the boat was too small to warrant shipment from Halifax to Selkirk.\n\nFrom time to time there are boats surplus to requirements of other government departments and the Department has written to the Government Contracts Supervision Committee, asking for an intimation in the case of suitable equipment being available for transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nBRANDON, June 19th, 1924.\n\nEXTRACT FROM PRIVATE LETTER TO MR. SUTHERLAND FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INDIAN EDUCATION.\n\nI met Mr. Blackford of Norway House School in Inspector Bunn's office. He was requesting a good wire fence for the school. Inspector Bunn and I know the situation and we agree he should have it. Dogs are terrible on the Norway House Reserve. So please get the Deputy Minister's authority to spend approximately $450 to properly fence the property on which the school buildings are situated. See Mr. Paget re the purchase. If he will allow competitive prices in Winnipeg, send Inspector Bunn the authority right away. The specifications are very important and are as follows:\n\n- 2550 Ft. 15 gauge, 2 Inch mesh, 60 inches high, fox wire (Est. cost $400),\n- 2550 Ft. barbed wire (for top strand) (Est. cost $45),\n- 1 Suitable front gate (Est. cost $5),\n- 60 Lbs. staples (Est. cost $8).\n\nPlease note that if 15 gauge wire is not available it should be 14 not 16. This is the only fence that will keep dogs (huskies) out of property and will last many years. Mr. Blackford has the posts and will do all labour. There is an item of $900 in for Norway House repairs, etc.\n\nI would have authorized Mr. Bunn to buy, but for the fact that the material is such that Mr. Paget might want manufacturers in East to quote. If they are, give them the fox wire only and let Mr. Bunn purchase gate, staples, and barb wire. If Mr. Paget decides on local purchase, Mr. Bunn should get the specifications and he will work fast as he knows it is advisable to have up the fence soon to protect flower beds, garden and other property.\nOttawa, June 21, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nA request has been received through the Superintendent of Indian Education, who is at present in the West, to supply for the use of the Norway House Indian Residential School sufficient wire, staples, etc., to erect a good wire fence for the protection of the school gardens and other property. He has furnished an estimate of the quantity of fencing, etc., required and states that he has consulted the principal and yourself regarding the matter.\n\nThe Department will approve of the supplying of this equipment and I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and delivery of the same, after obtaining competitive prices from a number of dealers. Properly certified vouchers in duplicate, together with an abstract giving the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted, should be forwarded in the usual manner. The specifications of the fencing, etc., required are as follows:\n\n- 2550 ft. 15 gauge, 2 inch mesh, 60 inches high, fox wire.\n- 2550 ft. barbed wire (for top strand).\n- 1 suitable front gate.\n- 60 lbs. staples.\n\nPlease note that if 15 gauge wire is not available, either 14 or 16 gauge should be obtained. The estimated cost of supplying this fencing is approximately $458. We understand that the Principal has the posts and will be responsible for all labour in erecting the fence, without charge to the Department. The above purchase should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

In this connection I have to inform you that Mr. Agent Gordon, Norway House, was authorized by official letter of April 30th, last, to arrange for the purchase of the materials necessary and to engage a competent carpenter to assist the school staff and older boys with the work of erection. He was requested to secure competitive prices for the material. He was informed that the amount provided towards the cost of erecting the hen house was $600 and that this amount was not to be exceeded.

The principal has about fifty acres cleared and the greater part of it broken. In order to do this work he has found it necessary to build a house for the men to live in during the winter while engaged in cutting down the trees. At another point on the island he has also found it necessary to build another dwelling and a stable for the horses and cattle housed there during the winter. The first house is 18' x 20' and the other 24' x 26'. The stable is about the same size as the second dwelling. All the buildings are well constructed log buildings. The principal has spent about $800 in cash for flooring, ceiling, window frames, doors, windows and hardware. I would estimate the value of the buildings at about $2500.\n\nAs this is an improvement in connection with the land used for school property I would appreciate it very much if the Department would make a contribution of $800 towards the construction of these buildings.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

The plumber from the hospital suggests that a heater of the following dimensions, and attachments be secured.\n\nPlease note specifications\u2014\n\n- Extra Heavy Tank \u2014 (This will stand 150 lbs pressure)\n- Capacity \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- 420 gallons\n- Size \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- 36x8\n- Openings \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- 1 Top \u2014 2 bottom \u2014 1 end\n- Manifold Coil, inside to heat water\n- Manhole in shell\n- Safety Valve.\n\nIt is imperative that we secure one of these immediately as we need the water for laundry purposes beside the kitchen and bath purposes.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. Gordon, Indian Agent and he advises me he will O.K. this requisition so that you may get quick action on the matter.\n\nThanking you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThis is a necessary repair.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has had the electrician who is installing the plant at the hospital look his over and it appears that unless new ones are sent in they are likely to be in darkness next winter.\n\nIt will require 32 cells comprising 250 volt Plants.\n\nI would appreciate very much if the Department would give instructions to have these sent out at the earliest possible date. It would be an advantage to have them out there before the electrician leaves Norway House. I understand that the old batteries were shipped out to be re-charged and fixed up but a number of glasses were broken in transit and the price of repairing would cost as much as new batteries. I believe the cost of the 32 cells will be about $540 with a 20% discount for cash.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, confirming a telegram which you sent to me on the same date with reference to the purchase of a \"storage tank 36\" x 8', capacity 420 gallons, heavy material to stand 150 lbs. pressure, with one top, two bottom and one end openings, manifold coil inside to heat water, manhole in shell and safety valve. Ship to Agent Gordon for Norway House Residential School.\n\nYou point out that it was necessary to telegraph in this connection as early shipment was advisable. I was in Winnipeg when I received this telegram and I got competitive prices from the Vulcan Iron Works and the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works. The former's price was $205.00, with $15.00 extra for a safety valve; the latter's price was $201.00 and $8.50 for the safety valve. After reading the description of what was required to the two companies, they asked me at what particular position on the boiler these openings were to be placed. As your telegram did not make this quite clear, nor did it state what size the openings were to be, or whether the boiler was to be perpendicular or horizontal, I wired you at once from Winnipeg, hoping to get an answer so that I could take it up with the company before leaving.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs your telegram did not reach me until after I arrived home, in fact only reached me on the 5th, I was compelled to phone long distance in to Winnipeg and give them the information. I may state, however, that it did not give me all the information asked for, as you stated that the position of the openings were indicated in your telegram to me. All your telegram said was that there were to be openings, \"one top, two bottom and one in the end\". I suppose the company wanted to know how many inches from the end and at what position on the boiler the openings were to be made. However, I have given them the contents of your telegram and I have no doubt they will place the openings where they think best.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nThe Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools reports that the electrician who is installing the electric light at the Norway House Hospital has stated new cells are needed for the electric lighting plant at the boarding school. It appears that the battery of 32 cells, which was supplied in 1920, was sent out to be recharged and repaired. A number of cells were broken in transit and Rev. Mr. Ferrier states that the price of repairing would cost as much as a new set. He estimates the cost of 32 new cells at $432.\n\nMr. Orr informs me that, with proper care, the battery should last longer than 4 years. I shall be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Sept. 10, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter with reference to the electric light plant at the Norway House Indian Residential School. I have noted that it may be necessary to purchase new cells for the battery. I regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to the question of authority in this connection as the battery, if given proper care, would have lasted longer than four years. You may remember that 32 cells were purchased from J. E. Yates & Co., of Brandon, at a cost of $700 in 1920. Any necessary replacements this year should be made from per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

I also enclose you two tenders, one from Wood Vallance and the other from Globelight Battery Co. for battery for the lighting system at the Norway House Boarding School.\n\nI had to accept of the Wood Vallance tender for two reasons. One reason was that it was a slightly larger plant than that tendered for by the other company. The main reason was that I had left Brandon for Toronto before the other one came to hand. As Mr. Blackford was in Winnipeg and was in close touch with the Wood Vallance Co., I phoned him to be sure to get the thing he required before leaving the city that he could get it on the last boat leaving Selkirk for Norway House. Mr. W. H. Lawson who has charge of this department in the Wood Vallance Co. accompanied Mr. Blackford to the warehouse giving him a vast amount of time after closing hours. It was through his assistance that we were enabled to get the battery away from Winnipeg and on the boat in time.\n\nTrusting the Department will be able to give this favorable consideration, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

I have to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that favourable consideration be given and a cheque has been directed to the firm in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI would call the attention of the Department to the large amount of work done and moneys expended by the management of the Norway House Indian Boarding School during the past year on plant. While much of this work was undertaken without the sanction of the Department, some of it was so far agreed to that the material was furnished.\n\nI would enumerate some of this work:\n\n(a) The whole of the labor in building the hen house.\n(b) The labor of taking out and replacing the flues in one of the heating boilers.\n(c) The installation of the boiler for heating water.\n(d) Considerable fencing.\n(e) Considerable work on the grounds about the building, levelling, etc.\n(f) Building of a cottage and stable at Hope Island.\n(g) Building of a kitchen addition to the engineer's house, and renovating the interior of the house.\n\nFor the latter two not only the labor, but the material was supplied by the School. I am assured by the Principal that the lumber cost him over $900.\n\nAs regards the cottage at Hope Island, I may say frankly that I would not have put so much money into this building until production from the Island warranted. There is a possibility that the overhead costs at this point may not be justified by returns.\n\nI would, however, recommend, in view of the large expenditure on both labor and material, which went into the plant that, if it can be arranged, a substantial grant, say $800.00 be made to the School as compensation in part for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst.

Ferrier's letter of December 7th, in which he made the requests for 1926-27 for the Methodist Church Indian Residential Schools. The original is on 160-3.\n\nNORWAY HOUSE:\n\nPainting material sufficient to paint the building inside and outside, is required, also Alabaster for all plastered inside work. Have troughing is needed for barn, henhouse, cold storage and carpenter shop, also conductors from the eaves of the main building into the drain or cistern. These have never been provided.\n\nA new Generator for the Electric Plant is required. The one now in use is worn out and was originally installed just for the main building. Now that all the outbuildings are connected, it would not do to attempt repairing it, as it is too small.\n\nThe Steam Plumbing is in need of general refitting inasmuch as the pipe is rusted out in many places.\n\nLumber is needed for the horse stalls and walls of cold storage plant.\n\nThe Principal has been clearing and breaking a lot of new land on the island, for which we have spent some hundreds of dollars and we would like a grant of $500 to assist in this work.\n\nA considerable amount of cement is required to replace that which was broken around the building and in the basement for the laying of drain tile to drain the foundation of the building.\n\nThe total cost will be at least $5,000.\n\nThe present building is filled to its full capacity and we have a waiting list of some 25 or 30 pupils. It is very necessary that our accommodation be increased to at least 140 or 150 pupils. This can be done for an outlay of about $40,000.\n\nYou will remember, in an interview last June, I brought before you the scheme that was on foot to erect a monument to the memory of the Rev. James Evans, our first missionary at Norway House. You kindly assured me that $1000 would be granted by the Department towards a $10,000 proposition.\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask for an accountable advance cheque to complete payment of labour in connection with Norway House School Bldgs. Three Hundred Dollars will be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

This invoice was for material shipped to the Indian Boarding School at Norway House, and as we do not suppose there is any mail connection at the present time, we feel that it will probably be useless to forward a new invoice. We are, however, enclosing copies of the invoices for your information in case you are able to do anything for us in this connection; otherwise, we assume that it will just have to remain outstanding until communication again opens up.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCRANE LIMITED\n\nBy [Signature]\nCredit Manager.\nOttawa, January 16th, 1926.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nReplying to your favour of the 12th instant respecting your account for $35.54, will you kindly inform me who ordered these supplies. If they were ordered by Inspector Bunn at Winnipeg, and if you have a railway shipping bill showing that the goods were delivered, Mr. Bunn can then certify to your account and forward it here for payment, without waiting for the certificate of the Principal of the Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nYou might take this question up with Mr. Bunn with a view to having your account paid forthwith.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(F.H.

I had told him that I would take over some of these when the work would be completed, such as 4 inch soil pipes, some elbows etc., at Winnipeg prices. Unfortunately, I was not at home when the work was completed, and the plumber, I think, must have left everything he had over. I received the attached statement a few days ago.\n\nIt is very necessary that we have a supply of repairs for waterlines, plumbing, etc., on hand, both for the hospital and the Agency, and especially for the school, as the latter system was installed several years ago and is constantly requiring some repairs. The eave trough we can use to advantage, as we have several buildings which should be equipped with eave trough to protect the foundations. Repair parts cannot be secured here in winter.\n\nThe prices, so far as I can discover, are fair. A few items listed I have been unable to find, and I have made corrections in red ink. I have certified that the material has been received.\n\nIf you can authorize the payment of this account and require my signature to the vouchers, please have Paulin and Swayze send to me the account in quadruplicate, when I will complete them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Wm. Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nIndian Office,\nRegina.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that I received from Indian Agent Gordon; also a copy of an invoice for a lot of odds and ends that were left there by Messrs. Paulin & Swayze who did the plumbing work at the school last year.\n\nHad it been anyone else but Mr. Gordon these men would have brought home their supplies, but as I have told you before, he is an easy mark, and as long as the Government is paying for it he will find an excuse to justify anything.\n\nWould you advise having these supplies sent back, or paying for them? I cannot see that everything that is there will be used; certain piping may be required, and a few odd tees. The Agent had no authority whatever to instruct Messrs. Paulin and Swayze to leave their goods at Norway House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.
