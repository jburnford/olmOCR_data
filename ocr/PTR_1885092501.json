Bedson went away from the scene of his duties as chief of the Transport service and supply department, he left instructions for Superintendent Gagnon of the N.W.M. Police Force to distribute among those who were really in distress the supplies which were left over, and which it was infinitely better to have used up in of any way than to carry back again. This distribution of Mr. Gagnon made in the most impartial manner he knew how, referring applicants, personally unknown to himself, for certificates to local officials\u2014unto whose well-quafilested with the true state of their circumstances, lest any should unfairly obtain what was urgently required by the really needy. The fact of this distribution having got about, has resulted in claims for relief being put in by great numbers\u2014probably some of whom we are credibly informed who offered employment for themselves and tenants refused it on the ground that the Government wished to help to feed them\u2014any how. To gentlemen of this class we wish to say a word or two. To begin with the petition sent into the Government by the enrolled residents would have framed agreeably to the expressed feeling of a largely attended public meeting, in a spirit rejecting charity but asking that some work might be given by means of which the necessaries for themselves and families might then be decently earned. This is what we have since advocated, nor have we any reason to doubt that as far as the bulk of the manly and independent spirited farmers of the district are concerned, there is still obtains. It will therefore be a gross injustice to the many if consequence of the conduct of the few, the impression should get abroad that the settlers wish to take advantage of what has happened to compel the government to support them for a season in idleness. We may as well tell such men plainly that they need cherish no such expectorution, for by the time the government has compensated the settlers for their losses, which there appears very inclining, as do in the past spring, they will have further the reason to refuse the inclination to fed men who refuse to accept work at fair remuneration. Again it may be well to point out that up to the present no government grant is promised or even asked\u2014such claim simply involves more for the consequences of the crop not having been put in. Should such claim be recognized at all, it can only become valid after half-time as the farmers appear to be awaiting the course of events to bring them to reap the fruits of his labour in the spring and that means at the time when crops usually have been gathered in and treasured out. That has certainly been a situation of no sort, rather than some general public work will be provided, we must sincerly hope, because we are aware that it is absolutely necessary. Without the majority of the settlers will be in a bad plight, because owing to the late arrival of train, some of them who retained a little seed grain were able to put in the little which they thought might furnish themselves and families with bread and also with food. The result of their small ventures has been caught by the frost, and consequently with the exception of wheat, the growth of which has not been around the town has had but a produce, absolutely nothing for the support of its inhabitants. We have no fear but that if the true state of things is represented to the authorities relief in some form will be afforded, but the product of such must be refused it on the ground that in the year last winter they were perfectly justified in requesting and accepting seed grain for the lands which no one doubted could have been cultivated as usual last spring.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nThe harvest of the agricultural show seems to come on to the present as a suitable time for devoting a little attention to the subject of the farming of our district. The total output of all our arrangements in the spring and summer months it now impossible to take advantage of the very favourable weather for putting in crops, accounts in the main for the destruction of what little was sown at a late date. It is idle however to discuss the fact that there exists, Indian in the section of country that they occupy, a moral enactment that they shall fire a penalty of not less than five pounds but that shall liable to imprisonment for a term of six months and fine not exceeding two shillings and six pence. Now know Ye, that I, the said Right Honorable Sir John Alexander MacDonald, Lieutenant-Governor of India Affairs, considering it be in the interest of Indians and Indians, hereby public notice that the sale, gift or disposal of fixed ammunition or ball cartridges, shall be unlawful from any Indian in the section of country that he occupies, and any Indian within such area loitering, hunting or selling with fixed ammunition or ball cartridges in the hands of Indians is punished by law. Any Indian found without a permit from this bureau may fined as directed by the laws of Canada or throughout any part thereof. All fixed ammunition and ball cartridges become the property of the Government at once and no man shall be permitted to use such ammunition or cartridges. Under the terms of the law, any person convicted of violating these provisions shall be fined two dollars and six cents.\n\nNotice of Dissolution.\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership hereunto existing between J.

D. MAVEETY, PUBLISHER AND PROPRIETOR\n\n3RD ST., PRINCE ALBERT, SASK\nFarewell Sermon\n\nSt. Andrew's Church\n\nSouth Branch, Sept. 21, 1865.\n\nThe sermon preached last Sunday in St. Andrew's church will hang forever in the hearts of the people of the parish; being Mr. Prichard's farewell sermon, after a ministry of twenty years in their midst.\n\nIt is not easy to describe adequately this parish and people in such perfect harmony that the united efforts of a whole parish are put forth to retain the services of their minister by choice; but it seems to be the case here.\n\nThe church was crowded, and after service, a meeting was convened for the purpose of expressing our understanding of the position of the parish being left without a resident minister. On due deliberation it was unanimously resolved that the Churchwardens and Vestrymen should draft and present petition to the Bishop, praying that Mr. Prichard be allowed to remain.\n\nAs public men generally get more blame than praise, it may be some consolation to Mr. Prichard to know that his services have been appreciated, and whether he remain or depart, he has the hearty good will of his parishioners.\n\nX.\n\nThe following petition has been since presented to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan:\n\nMay it please your Lordship,\n\nWe the Church wardens, vestry and members of St. Andrew's Parish in the diocese of Saskatchewan, humbly pray your Lordship to be pleased to grant us:\n\n1st. That we have heard with deep regret the intention of your Lordship to remove from our parish our esteemed pastor.\n\n2nd. That it is apparent that church supplies may be supplied from a distance and by land.\n\n3rd. That we may be without a resident clergyman.\n\n4th. That we have every confidence and regard for our present pastor and that his parish is far in the enjoyment of unity, that the church is in a very healthy condition.\n\nYour petitioners would therefore pray:\n\n1st. That it may please your Lordship to allow Mr. Wainey and Mr. Mackenzie to assist Mr. Prichard, to remain in charge of this parish.\n\n2nd. That it will be very hard to procure the services of clergymen in cases of death, sickness, etc., from a distance.\n\n3rd. That they may not be left without a resident pastor.\n\n4th. That having every respect and esteem for Revd. Mr. Prichard, and your petitioners do not wish to change him, but make it might destroy the unity of the parish, and result in causing an opening between the parish and a footing which appear present unanswerable.\n\nThat though this parish is comparatively poor and small being situated at a school and another school in the district and not supported by any society and that it indirectly receives great impulsion for the sake of your resident pastor.\n\nThat we the residents of this parish humbly pray your Lordship to take into consideration our petition into consideration.\n\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\n\nSigned in behalf of the members of St. Andrew's Church,\n\nChas Adams, Churchwarden.\n\nWm. Cuthbert, People's Warden.\n\nJames Murray, Surveyor.\n\nJos. Halcroon, Overseer.\n\nRobert Stevenson, Vestryman.\n\nWm. Robson, Church Steward.\n\nWork of the Mound Builders.\n\nInteresting Discovery of Relics at St. Andrews, Man.\n\nYesterday evening at St. Andrews C. N. Bell discovered the arrowhead workshops and pottery places of the Mound Builders, and secured 182 flint and other hard stones, also 100 arrowheads, some of which were very finely finished. He also brought back 27 fragments of earthenware, some decorated in a most extraordinary way, by impressions of a moulding, some being quite artistic in design and execution. Amongst other articles obtained were arrow points, stone hammers, making flint points, shell beads, small perforated earthenware tube like the stone arrow heads, and several broken points, flint limes for making arrow heads, etc. If there are any flint deposits in this country, they are not generally known. Some of the arrow heads are made from quartz almost transparent. The pottery seems to have been made by boiling decomposing granite and mixing it with clay, when it became a kind of baked. Several lamps of the granite used were found beside the broken pots. The fragments of earthenware were show plainly the granite with the clay. This is the first brick made of stone implements in this part of the country. It is interesting to find where the where the artisans of the Mound Builders used to sit and fashion implements and wax to exchange with those who inhabited and labored.\n\nSeeing the Serpent.\n\nA Monster of the Deep Creatures in Saskatchewan at a Quebec Watering Place.\n\nGreat excitement has been caused at the quiet watering place of Rie, Quebec, by the appearance of a sea serpent, which, from the descriptions given, must have been the giant of the gulf last year by the captain of the steamship Penhale, Capt. MacKenzie, H. A., of Montreal. The steamer was then lying at Rie, was out in the bay shooting wild geese with Mr. Wainey and Mr. Mackenzie, when what at first appeared to them to be a spar or mast of some wrecked vessel, came up out of the water. On reaching it, they were horrified to find that it was a monstrous creature, which on seeing the boat, raised its head out of the water, its eyes, glaring like the head lights of a locomotive, were the size of dinner plates, its mouth (it had no teeth) was the size of a houseboat, and with its open mouth filled with long, prong pointed teeth, it looked like a huge dragon. Mr. Mackenzie and Wainey discharged their rifles, and it is supposed their bullets fell off as streaks of blood were afterwards seen on the shore, several fishermen around the spot. The lashing of the creature was so violent, that it seemed to be quite impossible for the serpents to follow up the chase in a bark canoe. Its color was dark, dirty pinkish red, and its body, from the neck down to under the water, that it was over 100 feet long. When last seen it was making at rail road, and was said to be going towards the lake, where there is a large cave, which it is supposed to inhabit. This cave was the scene, about two weeks ago, of the massacre of over 100 Indians, who were refuge there and were discovered by their enemies and put to death. Means, Mackenzie and Wainey thought it best to send a party to capture the serpent, but as yet they have been unable to get the necessary means of transportation, as the inhabi tants are panic stricken.\n\nCanadian.\n\nThe Capital.\n\nToronto, Sept. 14.\u2014Sir Charles Tupper has received a cablegram from the secre tary treasurer of the Manitoba Board of Agriculture inviting him to be present at the formal opening of the Provincial Exhibition in Winnipeg next month, but will not be able to be present at the Exhibition, but will be in Winnipeg earlier to attend the opening of the Exhibition, the importance of Manitoba being adequately represented at the Colonial Exhibition in London next year.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific and Canadian Pacific will unite in making a Manitoba exhibit at the Colonial Exhibition next year.\n\nJohn Tobin, who has been in charge of the Canadian Pacific exhibit in the North West since the 1st of March, has returned to Ottawa.\n\nToronto.\n\nToronto, Sept. 14.\u2014Toronto beat the Princesses by 6 to 3.\n\nThe Maple Leafs got 6 runs to Toron toto's 3.\n\nJames Griffiths, of Buffalo, defeated Joseph Sinclair, of this city, in a three mile race the day before yesterday for five hundred dollars, by four lengths, time, 19 minutes.\n\nThe English cricketers versus Onta rion first match, was finished at 11 this morning by the Englishmen winning by an innings and 97 runs.
