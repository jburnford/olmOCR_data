H. Macdowall.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\nWEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 1883\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR\nThe annual report of the Department of the Interior has been published. As deals entirely with matters in connection with the North-West Territories certain sections of the report will be found particularly interesting and instructive. The report points to the organization of the Department as a striking indication of the rapid settlement of the Territories and illustrates the importance of the correspondence for the year 1882 and that for 1883. In 1881, the number of letters received was 13,600, and the number sent, 14,820. In 1882, the number received was 30,300, and the number sent, 30,300. This shows an increase of 17,000 letters received and sent in 1882 over those received and sent in 1881.\n\nThere were in 1882 only 5,600 entries at customs, while in 1881 there were 10,000 entries, representing an increase of 4,400. In 1882, the number of entries was 10,000, while in 1881 there were 10,000 entries, representing an increase of 4,400.\n\nIn conclusion, the report shows that the Department is doing its work efficiently and effectively.\n\nBUFFALO HALL\nOUR STOCK CONSISTS IN PART OF\n\nThese and all other articles in stock will be sold at prices unequalled by any house in Prince Albert offering goods of the same quality.\n\nBETTS & GWINNE.\nTO THE LADIES.\nNEW Spring & Summer Goods\nJUST RECEIVED BY EXPRESS.\nMillinery,\nLadies' and Children's Furnishings\nEvery effort made to give satisfaction.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.,\nCAMPBELL'S BLOCK,\nPRINCE ALBERT,\nN.W.T.\n\nW.
