When a fire arises, it only wants a quantity of combustible material and a fair wind to make it an uncontrollable enemy. Prince Albert is just now situated in such a manner as would ensure its speedy destruction in the event of a fire. The river bed forms a channel through which there is a continual current of wind, and the long continuous rows of wooden houses along the main streets supply a fire with all needed material when ever it takes place. The fire at the Transportation Company's wood yard on Friday last is a warning which should not pass unheeded. If nothing more was to be done we should at least organize a good bucket company. The mere advantage of having buckets in readiness, and not every body knowing his proper place would in itself be of immense advantage.\n\nCAREY'S DOOM.\n\nThe news of Carey's doom seems to have created very little comment. It was what everyone expected. Notwithstanding the precautions of the Government his avenging fellow conspirators dodged his steps. When he reached a chance to kill him, became indignant and ran away the lives of his companions in iniquity he becomes despicable in the eyes of all mankind. This was the position in the case of the in former case. His charge has been so redeeming because he was an organizer and leader of assassins\u2014the men who expanded their crime upon the gallows were merely tools. They had no ambition to acquire the characters of men, from a few stolen ideas of patriotism, take their lives in their hands, believing that by doing so they can serve their country and race, but the realising of a cynical villain who trades on the patriotism of those more honest, if more ignorant than himself, and then Judas-like betrays them and cheats the hangman by turning informer is a traitor to humanity, and of all crimes most detestable. The traitor's death which Carey met was but a fitting termination to a most infamous career.\n\nTHE LIBEL SUIT.\n\nOur readers will remember that in the issues of the Prince Albert Times of the 14th and 21st of last March, two articles appeared reflecting upon the private and social standing of our former editor Mr Fitz Cochrane. On account of the importance of these articles Mr. Cochrane brought an action of libel against the proprietors of this paper, and the case was entered for trial at the last May sitting of the District Court. The District Court was adjourned until the next October sittings at our request on the ground of the absence of material witnesses. The length of time which has elapsed since the appearance of these articles, has to a great extent had an ameliorating effect upon Mr. Cochrane and ourselves, and we have agreed to bury the hatchet, and settle our differences without going into court to judge and jury. One part of the compromise being a public withdrawal of the charges contained in the articles referred to, and the payment of costs. We think the suit therefore now subsides with charge, and regret that they were ever published, and trust that Mr. Cochrane has not been injured in any way by their publication.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\n\nGeneral Merchants\n\nSTEWART & WOOTTON\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nIndian Traders\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\n\nKNOX & BARKER,\n\nCarpenters and Builders.\n\nJob Work Promptly Attended to.\n\nPlans and Estimates Furnished when Desired.\n\nResidence\u2014BELL'S RESTAURANT.\n\nBELL HOTEL.\n\nMEALS AT ALL HOURS.\n\nW.

Railway.\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir, If your space permits I will be obliged by your inserting a few remarks prompted by the publication in your issue of the last week of a report of an examination before trial before Mr Cameron's Fiddler. While I admit that the report in the form given is not altogether accurate and sensible paragraphs, I venture to question the wisdom of treating outbreaks of that nature from the stand point of fact. That other considerations are based on the fear that strong tends to encourage stronger, which may indeed be true, which is to be feared is hardly only too prevalent in certain quarters, and which is especially dangerous in view of the present stage of the question. ginger, bar oil, etc., epimolus generally. It would doubtless be a stupendous act to attempt to arrest such a natural tendency between magistrates and police on the one hand and the lawless classes on the other; but, as a matter of fact, there is sympathy which ought to exist between the former and the respectable classes in question, and which ought to be greatly displayed. That this must be the result of anything leading the public some time ago when the most serious complaints had been made against the administration of justice is obvious, and my belief that your readers will see fit to bear in mind indicates me to draw your attention to the considerations influencing my mind in answering Mr Cameron's charges.\n\nThe public are apt to forget that he was many cases within his jurisdiction, a magistrate who had no power of removing persons from a jury, and consequently that the amount of credit to be given to evidence legally admissible, so that Mr Cameron's charge and proof. Without wishing to unnecessarily injure the defendant's character, I must say that Mr Cameron is justified in accepting his statement, who directly opposed to those of the complainant, must have been the chief cause of the distinctly corroborated by the last fact, whose evidence was so much shaken by the manner in which he conducted himself during the course of the proceedings, that Mr Cameron's character was so far removed from that of a man who would be likely to roll up his sleeves, and upon getting within reach strike him on the face.\n\nMr Cameron's conduct, however, was worthy of mention providing the second blow, also struck by Fiddler, was an attempt at intimidation, which could seem to either party, but surely Cameron experienced something of forbearance in wait, but perhaps that thing should have been done to defend himself as you put it, \"make one in a square fight.\" Lastly, to take Fiddler's case, Mr Cameron, having, he who having had all day to consider some mischievous little trick which he alleges he intended to play, had already started, deliberately searched out Cameron in the hay field to have what he says \"embarrassing\" him. Mr Cameron, the moment after, with his hat ready, as soon as the second alarm, so well as the sudden realization that though he did not at length find Cameron's character necessary to do so, it has become necessary for his safety, permitted the complaint to be brought, and the first blow of the second. Here arises his statement that in the course of the day came accidentally into contact with Mr Cameron, who made quiet tally with the sworn testimony of Cameron and the boy. In the effect that Mr Cameron was very friendly with it at Cameron's head. If this accidental contact did not hurt Cameron down, there was nothing to prevent Mr Cameron that the intention of the blow was pretty good. The state of Cameron's eye was such that Mr Cameron was unable to require any comment. This is my opinion is serious enough without taking into consideration that Fiddler, Mr Cameron down in the hayfield, was only de- sired from pushing him when his heart was not ready, and that he had no witness been within range. Mr Cameron's letter originally implies that improper conduct was committed by the necessity for alteration and improvement in both Civil and Criminal procedure.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1883082201.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 6, "total-input-tokens": 9408, "total-output-tokens": 5064, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 6074, 1], [6074, 10405, 2], [10405, 10920, 3], [10920, 12414, 4], [12414, 15766, 5], [15766, 19809, 6]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false]}}]
