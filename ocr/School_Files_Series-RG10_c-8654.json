Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: SEWERAGE PUMP\nELKHORN, Manitoba.\n\nWe have inspected the Sewerage Pump and Installation and report as follows:\n\nThe Pump is a Vertical Centrifugal Pump set in a Concrete Well. The Well is five feet nine inches square. Nineteen feet deep. The concrete top, bottom and sides are in good condition. There are four by four beams in the centre to carry the Pump Shaft. These are in good condition but where the holes are drilled for the bearings the holes are worn big. The Sewerage is admitted into the tank at a depth of ten feet five inches from the top of the tank.\n\nThe sewerage enters the tank after going through the Septic Tank and is clear water without any solids. The Water is elevated Twenty Five feet into a trough which conveys the water away from the buildings.\n\nThe Pump Shaft is twenty feet long anchored in three places down the well. These bearings are worn, the first has one and one half inches of play, the second has two inches of play and the third is broken entirely. The shaft moves approximately three inches from side to side while running.\n\nThe pump is of unknown manufacture. We could not empty all the water out of the tank because the pump would not lift the last two feet out of the well. This is an indication that the Impeller Blades are badly worn giving too much room between them and the pump housing. The head of the pump is badly worn there being about an inch of play where the shaft enters the pump. This was shimmed up by the School Engineer in June who wedged a piece of steel between the shaft and the pump head. This has cut down some of the play.\n\nWe would recommend that the following be done:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Pump being of unknown manufacture the Impeller Blades are worn and the head also worn. We would recommend that a new pump of similar design.\n\nA new shaft should be installed with three new shaft bearings.\n\nThe Braces: Four inch Angle Iron should be bolted to the present four by four's with the shaft bearings bolted to the steel.\n\nThe four inch discharge pipe will have to be renewed.\n\nThe line shaft could be done away with by installing a support-motor and stand on top of the shaft.\n\nWe have written for prices on another pump of a similar design and will quote you a price when we have the necessary information.\n\nWe remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"R.A.

If\nso, you might let me know the exact type of lumber which is necessary and the name of the firm from whom you consider it could be secured. When we have this information the matter will have further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nRE: ELKHORN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, ELKHORN, MANITOBA.\n\nFurther to our memorandum dated the 18th ultimo regarding an inspection of the roof of the above school, you are advised that a report has been received from Mr. Gow which is summarized as follows:\n\nMr. Gow was accompanied on his inspection by Mr. Zeigler, Manager of the Central Sheet Metal Works of Brandon, Manitoba. He reports that the school was erected in 1897 and enlarged at a later date. The original building has a mansard roof, on which both the flat deck and sloping surfaces are metal covered. Leakages occur intermittently through the ceilings of three rooms located in the newer portion of the building, the roof of which is flat and also metal covered.\n\nAfter his examination of the roof surfaces, Mr. Gow reports that one leak occurs where a plumbing vent passes through the covering, but that the sources of the other two leaks may be some distance from the points where water enters the rooms.\n\nMr. Gow reports that there is very little evidence of repairs of any extent having been carried out, and that the metal roof covering now in place may be the original installation. There are a few small breaks and holes in the metal covering and, while the metal has deteriorated, such deterioration seems to be uniform.\n\nIt is reported that several sections of the metal roof covering have become detached from the roof deck, due to the battens holding the metal in place having become loosened. Mr. Gow states that the roof covering will, eventually, have to be replaced, but for the present it is serviceable. He considers the existing leaks can be eliminated by minor repairs.\n\nMr. Gow also inspected the class room building at the school, situated about 250 yards distant from the main building. He reports it to be a two-storey frame structure which originally occupied another site. It is understood that this building was moved to its present position after a new foundation had been built for it. The lower floor contains three class rooms and storage space, while the upper floor is unfinished and is not being used. This building also has a mansard roof.\n\nJ.M.Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nthe flat deck of which is covered with ready roofing and the sloping surfaces a shingle finish. Mr. Gow reports that leakages are occurring through the ready roofing but that the shingles appear to be in fair condition. Temporary repairs to the ready roofing are suggested by Mr. Gow.\n\nIt is considered evident from the report that the class room building suffered considerable damage while being moved. The report indicates that the superstructure is resting unevenly on the foundation, which has caused warping of the frame walls, with the result that windows have become distorted and displacement of structural members framing the mansard roof has occurred. In this connection, the following excerpt from Mr. Gow's report is quoted:\n\n\"A thorough examination is necessary by a competent carpenter to determine just what is involved in making this building structurally safe and repairing the second storey windows. The present roof on this building will shortly have to be replaced with a more substantial covering than the present tar paper. The shingles of the mansard roofing appear to be in fair condition.\"\n\nThe Elkhorn Indian School is an old building and considerable replacement work will be necessary, both within and on the outside of the buildings if the school is to continue operating. I understand that the matter of continuing the operation of this school is receiving consideration and accordingly only such minor repairs as are urgent should be proceeded with. We are not prepared to make any estimate of the probable cost of repairs to the class room building.\"\n\nMr. Gow reports having discussed the matter of immediately necessary repairs with Mr. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Winnipeg, and with the Principal and Engineer at the school. It was agreed that roof repairs of a temporary character were to be carried out by the school engineer and that the account would be forwarded to Mr. Hamilton. The repairs comprise:\n\na. Re-fastening roof battens into position and applying roof cement to joints in metal covering on the main roof; and\n\nb. Patching and applying roof cement to leakages in ready roofing on class room building.\n\nNo estimate of cost for temporary repairs has been furnished, but the roofing cement has been purchased and delivered, and by this date work should be completed.\n\nThere are no drawings of the Elkhorn Residential School among Indian Affairs record plans, but in view of Mr. Gow's remarks regarding the class room building, we feel that a definite hazard to the safety of pupils and teachers exists.\nIf the Institution is to continue in operation, major repairs to both the Residential School and the class room building will be required. This will necessitate a complete survey of both structures and their mechanical services to determine the extent and approximate cost of the work involved.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nNovember 13th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Residential School, Elkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nMr. D.B. Gow, of our Dominion Water and Power Bureau staff at Winnipeg, has made a personal inspection of the roof of the above building, and I am attaching herewith a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills dated November 9th, which summarizes Mr. Gow's report.\n\nYou will note that roof repairs of a temporary character were to be immediately undertaken by the school engineer, and that this work should be completed by this date.\n\nMr. Gow expresses some concern in regard to the class room building at the school, and which was moved to its present site after a new foundation had been built for it. Apparently this building suffered considerable damage while being moved, with the result that it seems to be structurally unsound. Temporary repairs to the ready roofing of the flat deck is suggested by Mr. Gow. However, the shingles on the sloping sections of the roof appear to be in fair condition.\n\nIf this Indian School will continue in operation for any length of time, extensive repairs to both the residential school building and the class room building will be required. In the meantime, Mr. Gow recommends temporary emergency repairs as outlined.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 15, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Department has just received a lengthy report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch with reference to Mr. Gow's examination of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. Part of this report reads as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Gow reports having discussed the matter of immediately necessary repairs with Mr. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Winnipeg, and with the Principal and Engineer at the school. It was agreed that roof repairs of a temporary character were to be carried out by the school engineer and that the account would be forwarded to Mr. Hamilton. The repairs comprise:\n\na.

It is hoped that this list can be substituted for the supplies requested in my letter of the 7th instant.\n\nMr. Hiltz had only just arrived at Elkhorn when he submitted his original request and had not had time to thoroughly go over his requirements. He is of the opinion that it would be to better advantage to have the paint requested on the enclosed list than that originally asked for. I trust it will not be too late to have this change made.\n\nA.G.Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nWith reference to our purchase requisition of November 14, ordering mattresses and paint for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, Inspector Hamilton states that additional quantities of paint are necessary.\n\nConsequently it would be appreciated if you would increase our requisition as follows:\n\n6 Gallons white enamel instead of 3 gallons ordered on original requisition\n\n6 Gallons inside white flat instead of 3 gallons ordered on original requisition\n\n15 Gallons cream inside flat instead of 5 ordered on original requisition.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nVirden, Man.\nNov. 25th 1944.\n\nRe NEW SCHOOL BUILDING.\n\nAll three classes are in this building now, and the change is certainly worthwhile, for it provides two rooms for recreation in the main building. However, I would like to bring to your attention certain improvements that could be made. In the first place, the lighting in all three rooms is decidedly inadequate. The lights should be lowered about two feet, and larger bulbs used. Mrs. Toone's room is certainly too dark, and besides the lights, I would suggest that another window be put in. Another cupboard is needed in her room. I think that green and white reflector about fourteen inches should be put over each light.\n\nThe decorators left a good deal of paint on the floors, and two or three coats of paint, or some good linoleum should be provided to make them look nice.\n\nA drinking fountain is needed in the Primary room, and one between the Intermediate and senior rooms. Water is already coming through the ceiling in two of the rooms.\n\nI discussed the question of Fire Protection in the main building with Mr. Hodkinson, and there appears to be ample provision. Is it possible to provide more toilets in the main building, and a new pump for the septic tank just west of the old power house?\n\nThere is plenty of blackboard space in the three rooms, and the furnace is certainly large enough to give satisfactory heat. I would suggest that one of the pianos be placed in the Primary room. I understand there is one in the residence. Generally speaking, the school equipment is satisfactory. I shall be glad to give you any information or assistance at anytime.\n\nClarence Moore\nSchool Inspector\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Repairs for Elkhorn School,\nYour file 106-0-5, dated November 14th.\n\nI have made further investigations into the cost of doing the re-flooring required and from the figures submitted by Mr. Hiltz, my previous estimates was too high.\n\nFlooring required - 10,000 sq. ft. of No. 1 edge grain fir flooring at the approximate cost of $95.00 per thousand $950.00\n\nTotal cost of labour for removing old floor and laying new as submitted by Mr. Middleton $400.00\n\n$1350.00\n\nI urge that this work be authorized and would suggest that the Purchasing Agent request quotations on either 3\" or 4\" first grade, edge grain fir flooring, f.o.b. Elkhorn, and the firms should be asked to quote on supplying all or any quantity they can spare, even as little as 500 sq. ft. It would also be advisable to ask from firms both in Winnipeg and Brandon, and perhaps Virden. I hope a real effort will be made to secure the lumber, because labor is available now, which will be impossible to get when spring arrives. Then, too, the new floors are urgently needed and will, when installed, change the whole interior appearance of the school.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to reflooring required at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. As the end of the fiscal year is approaching our funds are becoming limited and consequently we are not in a position at the present time to authorize the expenditure that would be necessary. However, we are endeavouring to arrange for the transfer of funds from the appropriation that has not been used and, if we are successful in that regard, we will be able to authorize the reflooring. I hope to be in a position to advise you definitely within the next ten days.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Repairs - Elkhorn School.\n\nThe benches in the dining-room need new tops. Mr. Hiltz will have the work done by his men but requests that we pay for the lumber. It will cost $26.20 and can be secured from the local dealer.\n\nThe stock well has partially caved in and a new one should be provided. I understand water can be secured at a depth of 20 ft. The cost would include labor for digging and well bribing. The total cost should not exceed $100.00. Please advise if this work can be proceeded with.\n\nSome of the electric wiring appears in none too good a condition and Mr. Hiltz is afraid of fire. He would like a check-up made by a proper electrician. I have no doubt that this old wiring is dangerous and according to present standards will perhaps be condemned. Please advise if a complete check-up is authorized. A suitable man could no doubt be obtained at either Virden or Brandon.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $26.20 in purchasing material required to repair the benches in the dining room at the Elkhorn School.\n\nWe will also allow an amount of $100 for labour for repairing the well used by cattle at this school.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it would be desirable to have a complete checkup of the electric lighting at this school and a report submitted to this office. This report should be made in two sections -- one outlining the immediate repairs required to keep the electric system in reasonably good condition and the second section outlining the items that must receive attention later but that could be deferred for a time. My reason for making this suggestion is that we are approaching the end of the fiscal year and our funds are becoming limited and I am not certain from your letter just what expenditure might be incurred if all the work that the electrician might suggest were carried out at the present time. However, as soon as the report is received the matter will be given further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Elkhorn Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT 10-691 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Mr. R.E.

This Tank had about a dozen pit holes in the bottom and I recommended that they get the local Blacksmith to weld them.\n\nWe remain\n\nYours very truly\n\nR. Q. Yates\nYates & Company\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Plumbing Required - Elkhorn.\n\nIn my letter, 209-11 A.C.E., dated November 7th, 1944, I pointed out the need and quoted - \"He (Mr. Yates) intimated the complete job would cost in the neighborhood of $550.00.\"\n\nThis was authorized in your letter 1060-5 dated November 14th, 1944.\n\nHowever I kept at Yates for a quotation and before receiving your authority I got the attached quotation, dated November 9th. It was slightly higher but the first amount was given without any figuring, so I instructed him to proceed.\n\nOn January 8th, 1945, I called on my way through Brandon to Elkhorn and Mr. Yates told me that he would have two men at Elkhorn on January 15th and to advise Mr. Hiltz. All the material had arrived and he thought the work could be completed in ten days.\n\nOn January 12th I again called to see that all was in order and that day in checking his previous figures on supplies, transportation and wages, he learned that the clerk had omitted the wages, which he estimates to be $150.00. I told him not to proceed with the work and to submit a new quotation. I went through Mr. Yates' estimate book and am convinced the wages, although noted by him, were omitted by his clerk on the quotation. He had all parts listed and priced and to this total the wages should have been added.\n\nI would like to get the job started at once because the extra conveniences are certainly needed. Please advise by radiogramme or air mail if authority is granted. If at all possible I would like the authority before Mr. Yates leaves on Wednesday for the East, so that the work can be started. The total now, as you will note, is $745.00. Mr. Hiltz is supplying accommodation and board.\n\nA.G.

On receipt of the report we wrote to Inspector Hamilton in regard to this matter and on November 9 he wrote as follows:\n\n\"I found one bowl broken. This, of course, must be removed. The additional four bowls and four baths are needed. Mr. Yates, from Brandon, had men working at Virden and I was able to get his advice concerning the proposed installations.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nMr. Yates, Plumbing and Heating Outfitter of Brandon, Manitoba, called at this office a few moments ago. Mr. Yates pointed out that there was a mistake in the tender he submitted on repair work at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. The mistake consisted of his failure to submit an item of labour costs amounting to approximately $150.00. If these labour costs are added, the total amount of the tender will be approximately $745.00.\n\nIn view of the condition of the Elkhorn School and the criticism to which the Department has been subjected, as the result of our failure to undertake certain repairs at the Institution, it would be appreciated if you did everything humanly possible to have this work started at once. Mr. Yates has promised me that he would wire the firm, issuing instructions for the work to start on Monday morning. It would be appreciated if you could send us back an assurance that the work actually started on this date.\n\nActing Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 19th, file 106-0-5, I would advise that the plumbers arrived at Elkhorn today to begin the work referred to in your letter.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Flooring - Elkhorn School,\nYour file 106-0-5, Jan.10/45.\n\nI note flooring is not available. I was in the lumber yard at Elkhorn last week and at that time they thought they could supply 1000 ft. of edge grain hemlock flooring - 4 inches wide. At Brandon, Wade & Sons, Ltd., promised 500 ft. of 4\" edge grain hemlock flooring, priced at $92.00 per thousand.\n\nI enquired at many places but could locate none. Spruce flooring would not be suitable. I would prefer to postpone the work until suitable flooring is available.\n\nI would suggest the purchase of the 1500 ft. mentioned above and that the matter then be left for a month and if at that time flooring is still unavailable, I would like the Department to purchase the list of material given in my report on the Elkhorn School dated January 15th, and to also authorize the work outlined.\n\nIf I am able to locate any further supply of flooring I will advise the Department at once.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENCY.\n\nI desire to refer to our requisition of December 21, 1944, for 10,000 Board feet of No. 1 Edge Grain Fir Flooring for the Elkhorn School.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of January 8, Inspector Hamilton was written and he has replied as follows:\n\n\"I note flooring is not available. I was in the lumber yard at Elkhorn last week and at that time they thought they could supply 1000 ft. of edge grain hemlock flooring, 4 inches wide.

It will take him at least two weeks to complete the work authorized. The school has engaged a second carpenter and he was busy building cupboards and fixing doors. There is considerable general repair work needed and this man will be kept busy for another month. I understand he is being paid by the Church Commission.\n\nThe kitchen tables had arrived, also the 24 chairs.\n\nThe work on the plumbing was to start today, January 15th, but due to a mistake in the quotation, has been cancelled. This was reported by an air mail letter.\n\nThe septic tank pump is on order and should arrive early in February.\n\nThe paint has also arrived. The painting will start after the repair work has been completed.\n\nFlooring in quantity is not available. I understand 1000 ft. is available at Elk Horn, and Wade & Sons of Brandon will supply 800 ft. The amount provided for the material and labor is $1350.00. If flooring cannot be secured I would strongly recommend that part of the money be used as follows:\n\n1. Supply 40 additional mattresses - then all the beds would have suitable mattresses; possible cost ------------------------ $292.00\n\n2. Rewire balance of bed springs - (68). Some of these are tied up with string and wire and the whole lot should be rewired. Possible cost ------------------------ $156.00\n\n3. Basement wall replastered and fixed with burlap approximate cost ------------------------ 100.00\n\n4. Material be supplied to enlarge chapel. The labor will be paid by the Commission. At present the chapel is very small - about 14' x 18'. A storeroom adjacent and about the same size could be added by removing the partition and building...\nmore seats - also redecorating.\nThis extra room is really needed because\nthe present chapel will not nearly\naccommodate the pupils.\nHard to estimate ---- perhaps --------- $150.00\n\n5. Pillows needed - 130. At present the boys have\nno pillows and those used by the girls\nare dirty. They are filled with a\nlumpy material which cannot be washed.\nPillow cases are now available at the\nschool for new pillows.\nApproximate cost ------------------ 124.00\n(Parkhills)\n\nThe laundry work is much better and the bedding has\ngreatly improved. It is a better color and the beds are much\nneater.\n\nThe breakfast and noon meals are good. I would like to\nsee a hot drink served at noon. Supper is lacking in some\nrespects and in a letter to Mr. Hiltz I have made suggestions\nwhich I think he will accept.\n\nThere was no serious sickness, although several were in\nbed with colds.\n\nThere is still room for improvement in staff. Mr. Hiltz\nneeds a new teacher to replace Mr. Hodgkinson, who is leaving on\nJanuary 31st. He also needs a nurse and a matron. The boys'\nsupervisor, Mr. Blenhard, is unsuitable and should be replaced.\nI have discussed his case with Mr. Alderwood and feel sure the\nchange will be made very shortly.\n\nChanges are taking place at the Elkhorn School but it\nhas been difficult to get materials and thus the work drags.\nMr. Hiltz has also been greatly handicapped with a staff, some\nof which have not given co-operation. Here again there will be\nsome changes and I hope within the next two months to report\nmarked improvements.\n\nMr. Hiltz appears to be a hard worker. He is anxious\nto get things in shape but being accustomed to a different type\nof school feels hemmed in and cramped. He apparently is liked\nby the pupils and has little trouble with discipline.\n\nA.G.

If it is possible to secure an additional quantity later, we will do so.\n\nOwing to shortage of funds, we will have to wait a few weeks to see if we can secure the additional lumber before consideration can be given to the five other recommendations which are contained in your letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, January 26, 1945.\n\nMr. A.

I was in the lumber yard at Elkhorn last week and at that time they thought they could supply 1000 ft. of edge grain hemlock flooring, 4 inches wide. At Brandon, Wade & Sons, Ltd., promised 500 ft. of 4\" edge grain hemlock flooring, priced at $92.00 per thousand.\n\n\"I enquired at many places but could locate none. Spruce flooring would not be suitable.\n\n\"I would suggest the purchase of the 1500 ft. mentioned above and that the matter then be left for a month.

I understand you have already inspected this premises while occupied by Mr. Povey and agreed on its being attended to. With Mr. Dahl doing the work himself it is a great chance to get this done at a cost of $75.00 or under.\n\n\"Material can be obtained here in Elkhorn as quantities are small.\"\n\nBefore asking the Department for permission I wanted a bill of the material showing exactly the cost and so wrote Mr. Hiltz as follows:\n\n\"I have your letter concerning this matter and note Mr. Dahl will do the work if the Department supplies the material. Please furnish a bill of material with prices.\"\n\nI am convinced Mr. Hiltz misunderstood my letter and took it as authority to proceed. I can assure the Department the repair work was needed as nothing has been spent on the house for at least twelve years. Mr. Dahl wanted the place put in order and so gave his labor, which would otherwise have cost at least $50.00.\n\nIn the future I will see to it that my letters cannot be misunderstood.

Chairs 40.80\n- 2 Kitchen Tables 20.42\n- Farmer's House decorated 75.12\n- New tops supplied for benches in diningroom 25.50\n- Stairways repaired, also hallway on boys' side, plaster repaired 401.35\n- 1000 ft. of flooring purchased 90.95\n- Electrical repairs 272.96\n\nAuthority still remains for the sewage pump $576.00; completion of well $100.00; laying of floor and repairs to floor - approximately $30.00.\n\nThe sewage pump so urgently needed and authorized cannot be shipped before about May 1st. The original was considered too small and a larger pump is to be supplied at the same price of $576.00. I understand this is being assembled now, but the date of delivery will be about as stated above. I presume this means now a charge against the next fiscal vote, or can it be handled any other way?\n\nThe well will be completed in a few days and the vouchers forwarded.\n\nWe of course could not begin to get enough flooring. In view of the quality now coming on the market I would recommend that for all halls linoleum be supplied. I would request four rolls of AA quality battleship linoleum, brown, and I enclose Ashdown's quotation. If placed by wire the material should arrive in time to be paid for out of this year's appropriation.\n\nWe still need about forty mattresses and if authority were granted these could be supplied within ten days from date of order. If authorized I could get quotations from Parkhill and Globe Bedding.\n\nThe plumbing has been well installed and I consider adequate.\nThe meals have much improved and I am sure can now hardly be justly criticized.\n\nThere has been a number of changes in the staff which has greatly improved the situation. A boys' supervisor is still urgently needed.\n\nThe rinse tub in the laundry is a galvanized water trough set in a cement base. This trough leaks and should be replaced. I would recommend that a new tub, 30\"x30\"x20\" deep placed on legs, be ordered immediately. I can have such a tub made by Default Sheet Metal Company, St. Boniface, for approximately $25.00, f.o.b. St.Boniface. This tub will be movable and the girls can stand up straight to rinse the clothes instead of reaching down within six inches of their feet. I urge that this piece of equipment be allowed.\n\nI strongly recommend the purchase of linoleum, the rinse tub and extra mattresses, then when the sewerage pump arrives the condition at this institution will be vastly changed as from a year ago.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n528 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to your recent visit to the Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the sewerage pump will not be available before May first. Consequently, it will be necessary to charge it against the appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure the linoleum.\n\nI do not understand your request for 48 mattresses. Under cover of your letter of November 7, 1944, you forwarded a requisition for 58 mattresses for this school. Our records indicate that these were delivered to the school.\n\nApproval is granted for an expenditure of $25.00, f. o. b.

We are now advised that owing to manufacturing difficulties it will be impossible to deliver this pump before May 1, 1945. It would therefore be appreciated if you would charge this amount to the appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46 and release the amount from our current year's Vote.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, March 17, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nThe Provincial Electrical Inspector recommended that extensive repairs be made to the wiring at the Elkhorn Residential School. Inspector Hamilton requested the Principal to secure prices, but he was unable to have anyone quote on the work. However, at the end of February, the Principal wrote as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Forester, who was going to do the work, is unable to do so, owing to shortage of help. I have secured electricians who are now here, working. If I had not allowed them to start I would have lost them. Electricians are like rubies these days. For the entire building, with complete check-up from top to bottom and some new material to combine with changes, the expenditure will be approximately $170.00 for labour and $125.00 for material. This also includes the dangerous wiring in the barn.\"\n\nInspector Hamilton has submitted the attached account, and under the circumstances it would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The Elkhorn School is a government-owned building.

I feel certain this is the best way to improve the halls and am pleased you were able to authorize the purchase.\n\nIt is true you have already replaced 58 mattresses. At the time of my recommendation there was so much needed involving heavy expense that I kept the mattress replacement as low as possible - knowing that as soon as funds were available a further supply would be required. Now that the request for fir flooring cannot be supplied and the sewerage pump is not available until after March 31st, I recommended this further supply of mattresses. I understand these can be made up and delivered within a week from the date of receipt of order.\n\nThe new laundry tub will be ordered at once.\n\nA.G.

Inspector Hamilton requested the Principal to secure prices, but he was unable to have anyone quote on the work. However, at the end of February, the Principal wrote as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Forester, who was going to do the work, is unable to do so, owing to shortage of help. I have secured electricians who are now here, working. If I had not allowed them to start I would have lost them. Electricians are like rubies these days. For the entire building, with complete check-up from top to bottom and some new material to combine with changes, the expenditure will be approximately $170.00 for labour and $125.00 for material. This also includes the dangerous wiring in the barn.\"\n\nInspector Hamilton has submitted the attached account, and under the circumstances it would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The Elkhorn School is a government-owned building. The coding on the account is as follows: - 578-76-10-691.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 12, 1945.\n\nMr. A.

Stairways and floors have been repaired and renewed as well as new doors installed. All doors leading from the dormitories have been hung to open out, and the toilets in the four dormitories are all in good condition.\n\nBed springs have been repaired and new mattresses supplied for 58 beds. The bedding is all well washed and looks clean. The plaster has been repaired and most of the walls and woodwork painted. The electric wiring has been checked and extensive repairs carried out. A number of chairs were purchased, also two work tables for the kitchen, and a new rinse tub for the laundry. Four rolls of battle ship linoleum have been supplied and this will be laid as soon as possible. In addition to all these repairs, the children are better clothed and undoubtedly much better fed. I discussed the meals with Dr. Johnson and he stated, \"I often visit the school at meal time and I have no hesitation in saying the children are now well fed.\" At present they obtain from three to four hundred pounds of milk per day and this is all given to the children. Mr. Hiltz also purchases 40 dozen eggs each month and these provide a change for at least three meals. He now has 250 baby chicks and hopes during the coming year to produce the eggs needed at the school.\n\nPerhaps the greatest change is in the attitude of the staff and pupils. The children appear very content and happy and for months no child has attempted to run away. The staff members are interested in their work and some of the members, after doing their regular work, gave up many evenings to help with the painting.\n\nWe are still waiting for the delivery of the septic tank pump and when it arrives Mr. Yates, from Brandon, will install it at once. In spite of all these improvements there is yet much to do and I present the following recommendations for immediate consideration:\n\n1. The sewage disposal field must be fenced away from the stock, and I enclose a sketch showing the proposed change. The following fencing is required:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|--------|\n| 900 yds. of 7-strand paige fence, 42\" high @ 40\u00a2 per rod | -72.00   |\n| 200 posts @ approximately .35\u00a2 each                  | -70.00   |\n| Braces for corners, 4x6                                  | -20.00   |\n| Gate - 16 ft. (Ashdowns)                                | -10.75   |\n| Staples, 100 lbs.                                        | -5.10    |\n\nTotal: $177.85\n2. Hog wire to make runs for present stock of pigs\n\n- 20 rods of 32\" hog fence\n  Ashdowns 08-52-33 @ 43\u00a2 per rod\n  $6.60\n\n3. Poultry fence \"Bantam\" Ashdowns\n\n- 20 rods @ $6.25 per 10-red roll\n  $12.50\n\nTotal for fencing $205.20\n\n4. The old chicken house has not been used for many years except as a junk shop. The frame work is fairly good, but it needs re-lining, insulation, complete new windows and a cement floor. In addition, Mr. Hiltz would like to enlarge the building by a 10-ft. addition in length, which means an addition of 10x16. The material required is estimated as follows:\n\n| Item          | Cost |\n|---------------|------|\n| Cement        | $70.00 |\n| Dimension Lumber | $50.00 |\n| Shiplap Lumber | $90.00 |\n| Siding        | $40.00 |\n| Trim          | $10.00 |\n| Insulation chips | $35.00 |\n| Windows       | $17.00 |\n\nTotal $312.00\n\n5. The hog pen, horse barn and cow barn all need certain repairs. The doors should be renewed, cement work repaired, certain partitions renewed, track hangers need replacing. These repairs are listed as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|\n| Lumber for 12 barn doors, large & small   | $60.00 |\n| Hangers                                   | $20.00 |\n| Track                                     | $12.00 |\n| Corner boards and ceiling                 | $50.00 |\n| Cement for barn and pig pen               | $10.00 |\n| Lumber for pig pen                        | $15.00 |\n\nTotal $167.00\n\n6. The outside classrooms (3) in one building are very cold in windy weather. This building should be made warm before next winter sets in. It should be covered with asphalt brick siding, or insul brick siding, or cement stucco. The estimated cost of material will be forwarded when received.\n\nThe furnace still appears too small to heat the school. I have asked Mr. Yates to look into this and submit a recommendation. I found the windows all very loose and no doubt if these were re-fitted much heat could be saved. I would recommend that the Department allow $200.00 to pay for labor in refitting all windows, repairing storm sashes, and installing insulation. The insulation would be an additional expense but I believe would be well worth while.\n\nI am quite aware that these recommendations entail considerable expense but the Department know the condition of the school, and this condition can only be improved if we secure the necessary funds. I do hope immediate approval can be given to all these matters so that Mr. Hiltz may proceed at once with the work.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nI was at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School on September 26th, 1945.\n\nThe School is now in charge of Rev. Mr. Dixon. He has only been there about three months but already appears to have a fair grasp of the situation. He has a new Matron, Miss Beanland, who has been loaned from a school in Alberta. She is a graduate nurse and appears very capable.\n\nThe School has been greatly improved as the result of the work done by Mr. Hiltz. The halls and many of the rooms have been painted, and all the halls are covered with linoleum.\n\nThe children are well dressed and neat in appearance.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and the beds neatly made.\n\nThe nurse has prepared a menu which appears carefully planned. I believe the children now are well fed.\n\nThe new septic tank pump has been installed. It works well and has plenty of capacity. I was very pleased with the pump and with the splendid job Mr. Yates made in installing it. Twenty minutes in operation twice a day empties the tank. The disposal from this tank has been a big problem for almost a year and this long awaited pump is indeed a welcome necessity.\n\nThe farm crop is light. They have no garden and so it will be necessary to purchase all the vegetables. Already the new Principal is ploughing garden land for next year and he plans on producing plenty for the School. The garden at this School has been neglected for years; but I believe from now on this work will receive special attention.\n\nThe work on the electric wiring is still not completed. The demand for electricians is very keen due to the program of rural electrification by the Provincial Government and so all such workers have more than they can do. I am yet hopeful of having the work completed before winter.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings need considerable repairing. A number of doors need to be renewed and glass is needed for several windows.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, Mr. Dahl, certainly has not measured up to his responsibility and is being relieved of his duties. I hope the School will be more successful in their next selection.\n\nA.G.Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant reporting on your visit to the Elkhorn Indian Residential School of September 26th.\n\nI hope you will be successful in having the electric wiring completed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Your file 106-0-5, October 4th.\n\nIn your letter 106-0-5, dated May 23rd, 1945, I was advised that the Purchasing Agent was requested to purchase the wire I had recommended. I did not receive a copy of the purchase order and when the account from the Beaver Lumber Company arrived I naturally figured it was for the wire authorized. I find now that Mr. Hiltz vouchedered direct for the wire ordered by the Purchasing Agent and the account for the wire purchased by himself was sent here.\n\nIf the account cannot be paid, I will notify Dr. Alderwood.\n\nA.G.

Dixon of Elkhorn Residential School:\n\n\"You no doubt have in mind a picture of the seven to eight feet high fence surrounding the girl's playground here. This fence is an ugly affair and badly broken in places. May I have your permission to take down most of this fence, saw the boards lengthwise into half-width and replace as a fence three feet high picket fence?\"\n\n\"The playground is no longer used exclusively by the girls but is now a common playground for boys and girls to skate and to play basketball. A sandpit, etc., has been reserved for the very small girls.\"\n\n\"I would also like permission to modernise the kitchen at the Residence. I propose doing this by placing a partition across from wall to wall which will just about halve the area and make the present narrow part of the kitchen into a lobby at the back door and giving access to the larder and basement.\"\n\n\"I need hardly say that these alterations will be carried out without any expense to the Government as I have all the material on hand.\"\n\nIn regards to the fence I might just add that in its present state it is practically useless. It should be repaired or rebuilt as suggested. If the Principal is satisfied with a low fence and is willing to do the work I would recommend he be permitted to make the change.\n\nThe changes to the kitchen apparently involves no change other than the erection of a partition, which partition could no doubt later be removed if undesirable. Since no expense is involved I would recommend the request be granted.\n\nPlease advise if the suggested changes are approved.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nOttawa, April 13, 1946.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 8th instant, you may authorize the Principal of the Elkhorn School to rebuild the fence and make the changes he suggests in the kitchen.

(RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 9)\nThe roof of the school building still leaks in places. The roof is covered with a metal material and the nails work loose allowing a driving rain to leak through. A heavy covering of tar and sand might eliminate the trouble. The outside walls of the top storey of the school are metal like the roof. This at one time was painted red. The paint has gradually disappeared and the metal is badly rusting. I would strongly recommend that it receive a coat of red paint. The school is very high and this work would need to be done by experienced painters.\n\nRepair work is required on the horse barn, granary and cow barn. The foundations need re-enforcing and considerable new lumber will be required to do the repair work. I suggested to Mr. Dixon that he get someone to give an estimate on the work and material, and forward it to his Commission. This quotation will then go forward for the Department's approval.\n\nI would also recommend that a quantity of paint be provided for the barns. After the buildings are repaired paint will be required. It will take about two five gallon tins of red barn paint and four gallons of outside white. If green is available two gallons (outside green) should also be provided.\nOttawa, June 7th, 1946.\n\nRev. B.O.G.

Item 4 referring to the kitchen flue under the range will have to be done by outside labour and I have asked a man to come in and take particulars.\n\nTo complete item 2, I have sent an order through to Winnipeg.\n\nI am not quite clear about item number 10. As you know we have a night watchman with a punch clock for the months of October to April, and we receive a grant towards the salary from your Department. Is it your wish that this man should be employed as night watchman for twelve months every year? Will the Department pay the grant towards his salary for twelve months every year?\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Rev. B.O.G. Dixon.\nPrincipal.\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Residential School\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI quote the following extracts from a letter received from Dr. Alderwood and signed by his Assistant Secretary, Mr. Forward.\n\nSchool roof:\n\"The tin on the roof has cracked and given away in many places as well as pulling through nailheads and is permitting the entry of water. The eaves surrounding the roof have warped and in some cases fallen completely away from the studdings and permit the passage of cold air unrestricted throughout the top storey. This situation makes heating a most difficult matter as well as encouraging further deterioration to the studding, plaster, and paint on the interior. The roof is felt to be the most important factor in the entire repair requisition and we stress the urgency of immediate inspection and action.\"\n\nSchool, Main Building:\n\"The exterior wood-work throughout the school needs repainting. There are evidences of dry-rot affecting the sills and it is felt that painting at once would save a far more costly operation of replacing the sills and sashes at a later date. Five Hundred and Fifty Feet of Thirty Inch screening is required to place the building in a fly-proof condition.\"\n\nDormitories:\n\"Five Dormitories, the Infirmary and the Sewing Room should be re-floored or at least have the necessary floor repairs made and a covering allowed. The sizes of the Dormitories and rooms are as follows:\n\nA. Dormitory..................1,152 square feet.\nB. Dormitory..................1,152 square feet.\nC. Dormitory..................1,152 square feet.\nD. Dormitory..................1,152 square feet.\nE. Dormitory..................1,216 square feet.\nInfirmary....................600 square feet.\nSewing-room..................360 square feet.\n\nThese floors have splintered under wear, throughout the many years past and in some cases have been worn as thin as one quarter inch. It would be useless to merely cover such spots with Battleship Linoleum without first effecting repairs. The floors in their present condition are what may be described as a colossal problem to keep in a clean and sanitary condition and it has been my personal experience to see children attempting to clean their dormitory and sewing-room...\"\nfloors by picking up each bit of fluff or thread ends in their fingers instead of being able to use a mop.\"\n\nPrincipal's Residence:\n\nThe exterior requires painting very greatly and it is requested that the following materials be supplied for the operation: Fifteen Gallons of Green Shingle Paint, Fifteen Gallons of Brown Shingle Paint and Ten Gallons of White Exterior Paint.\"\n\nFarm Buildings:\n\nWe feel that the school main building is of prime consideration this year and feel also that the Department is providing a Manual Training Instructor for the school that repairs to the Farm Buildings could well be undertaken by the Manual Training Instructor as organized training projects for his pupils. At this time therefore, we make no requisition for repairs to the Farm Buildings but ask that it be kept in mind that repairs are imminent and we may require assistance in the form of lumber and material.\"\n\nThe condition of the school roof has been reported on before and a year or so ago Mr. Gow of the Surveys and Engineering Branch made an inspection and suggested temporary repairs which I believe were carried out. I would recommend that Mr. Gow make a further inspection and submit a report with definite recommendations for a permanent repair job.\n\nThe exterior of the school certainly is in need of painting and this was mentioned in my report of May 14th.\n\nThe condition of the floor is bad and authority was granted last year to purchase flooring. Material was not available and I doubt if Maple flooring can yet be secured.\n\nThe 520 feet of screening should be supplied. The screens will then be repaired and remade at the school.\n\nThe paint should be supplied for the exterior of the Principal's residence. No mention was made of labor so I presume this will be supplied by the school.\n\nThe repair work outlined will involve heavy expense but should be undertaken without delay.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, August 6, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter of the 25th ultimo, it is not our intention to pay for the salary of the night watchman for 12 months.

Please let me know the quantity and type of paint required for the Principal's residence, so that the order may be placed through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWe will have to defer consideration of the other requests until we ascertain what expenditure will be required in connection with the roof.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 12th and the report of Mr Moodie, Fire Inspector, I am unable to find anyone willing to undertake the recommendations in section 4 of the report, namely, putting extra protection under the kitchen stove. For your information I may say that our kitchen stove is some twenty feet long, three feet high and three feet wide and it is set in a concrete base. The floor in front of the stove is protected by thick metal. If Mr. Moodie's advice is followed we will have to have a new kitchen stove as this one will not stand any moving.\n\nShortly after taking up my appointment in July 1945 I asked Inspector A.G. Hamilton to have the school roof fixed, the eaves re-built and the exterior of the school painted. I repeated this request in May of 1946 and still nothing has been done. The roof leaks badly and the rain is spoiling every ceiling on the top storey. If rain is able to come in it is obvious that heat can go out and we are still attempting to heat the building with a boiler which blew a section in 1938. During the winter we burn a ton and a half of coal a day and yet we hear criticism about the cold building. Can something be done about this?\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Rev. B.O.G. Dixon\nPrincipal.\nAugust 21st, 1946.\n\nMr Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt: of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa. Ont.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nSince my letter of August 19th I have had a visit from Inspector A.G. Hamilton and it appears that action is now being taken with regard to the roof of this school and the painting of the eaves.\n\nI explained the difficulty about the kitchen stove to Inspector Hamilton and he thinks it would be best for him to speak to Mr Moodie and have him suggest an alternate method of adding protection under the stove.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Rev: B.O.G. Dixon.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Roof on Elkhorn School,\nYour file 106-0-5 WTL August 6/46.\n\nAttached is a quotation by Mr. Ziegler of the Central Sheet Metal Works, Brandon, on renewing the roof of the Elkhorn School.\n\nMr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power Bureau had Mr. Ziegler repair the school roof at the Brandon School some five or six years ago, and the work was satisfactory. He also examined the roof of the Elkhorn School along with Mr. Gow two years ago, and on his advice certain repairs were done, which made it possible for us to carry on. I consider Mr. Ziegler a reliable person and the fact that the Johns-Manville Company is willing him to handle their roofing and will give a 20 year bonded roof indicates his work is satisfactory.\n\nThe present metal roof is very loose and badly cracked. Mr. Ziegler said it was much worse than when he last examined it. He was surprised that the heavy winds had not ripped it off, especially on the west side. In some places it has bulged off from the roof from six to eight inches. This buckling from the roof allows it to move up and down with the wind and of course this causes cracks. It also leaks around the nail heads. The school was built about 50 years ago and this is the original roof.\n\nMr. Ziegler's price is on a Johns-Manville Company built up roof and in a second letter he states how this will be done. Mr. Ziegler is prepared to do the work if it is started soon before the cold weather. A new roof is essential and I recommend Mr. Ziegler be instructed to proceed with the work at once.\n\nI attach a rough sketch showing the type of roof and plan of surface. It is only the top area dealt with in Mr. Ziegler's quotation. The steep sides are covered with a light weight tin. The paint has almost entirely disappeared and most of the area is badly rusted. This portion should be scraped or brushed with a steel brush, treated with a rust resisted paint, and then painted. This work is important and if not done we will find ourselves faced with another roofing job. I have asked for a quotation on this work from Mr. Baker, a local painter, living in Elkhorn. As soon as his quotation arrives I will send it forward. I would, however, point out that the portion of the roof referred to is very high from the ground. It is steep and...\nThere is between 5 and 6 hundred feet of this wall which is covered with tin. It is badly rusted and needs to be scraped and painted first with a primer to prevent rusting and then with the Bristol paint\u2014the desired color.\n\nThis is the part recommended for new roof.\nCENTRAL SHEET METAL WORKS\n\nBrandon, Man.\n\nAug. 26/46.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n528 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th instant re my quotation on the roof at the Indian School Elkhorn, Man.\n\nThe 20 year bonded Johns-Manville Co. roof I quoted on is a 4 ply construction made up as follows. 1 ply 45 lbs. base felt, 3 ply of 15 lbs. asbestos perforated asphalt felt laid in hot asphalt, with a top coating of regal dressing.\n\nI would not like ot recommend a pitch and gravel roof for this job as I think there is too much incline on the deck to be satisfactory for this type of a roof. If however they insist on this I would like to have a manufacturer's agent look over the roof first and get his o.k., and also his specification before I would like estimate on it.

This area does need painting and in connection with this Mr. Baker writes as follows:\n\n\"One coat of paint applied to fourth story of school building, trim and window sashes, (not including storm-sashes) including rubbing off rust spots; labor only $120.00. Second coat as above $75.00.\n\nWe have very carefully inspected this roof and it is my firm opinion one coat would do a good job here. There are actually very few rust spots, what appears to be rust is the old red paint. I believe there is no object in loading sheet metal with too much paint, as it has been my experience that it peels and blisters under the sun. However should you desire two coats I will apply the second coat for $75.00.\n\nWe paint storm-sashes at the rate of 90\u00a2 per hour (labor only) replacing putty and glass where necessary. The condition of these is so variable that it is difficult to form a satisfactory estimate.\"\n\nThere is a large area to cover and you will note it is around the fourth story of the building. A difficult and dangerous place to work. I consider the price for labor of $120.00 very reasonable.\nThis metal sloping roof was painted red before and no doubt it would be best to stay with that color\u2014perhaps tending to a maroon rather than bright red. I understand special paint is required for metal.\n\nThe surface to be covered consists approximately of 5,000 square feet and the Painter, Mr. Baker states it will require 18 gallons. I would suggest that four, 5 gallon tins be purchased.\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba\nOttawa, 21 October 1946.\n\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nMr. A.G.

These reports are on the whole most satisfactory and very complimentary to the Principal, the Reverend Mr. Dixon. The Department is very pleased to note the change which has been brought about in this school within the last two years.\n\nInsofar as the maintenance of the school is concerned, Mr. Moore has the following comments to make:\n\n\"Better toilet and drinking facilities should be provided, and a storm door is needed in Miss Fry's room, leading to the fire escape. The ceilings in three classrooms in the main school are in very poor condition and need immediate attention. The school building is generally cold and should be insulated. Some storm windows are needed, as well as better lights. The floors are in poor shape.\"\n\nCould you please let us have an estimate for\n\n(a) the provision of the storm door and storm windows required,\n\n(b) repairs to the ceilings in the three classrooms.\n\nWould you consider it advisable to have an official of the Survey and Engineering Branch visit this school to render a report upon the advisability of insulating it.\n\nBernard F.

You of course know all doors must open out to meet fire regulations.\n2. How many storm sashes do you require for the school building - give size and price?\n3. Get estimate on repairing ceilings in the three classrooms.\n\n\"A prompt reply will be appreciated as the information is needed by Ottawa.\"\n\nOn January 4th, after my second letter, he replied as follows:\n\n\"I have delayed replying to your letter of December 16th until such time as I could give you worthwhile estimates.\n\n1. This item has been attended to by the Manual Training Shop at no cost to the Department.\n2. Storm Sashes .... four 26x28 - 2 light, three 12x26-- 4 light.\n   No price can be obtained locally.\n3. The trouble here is not with the ceiling but with the roof which is completely finished. Not only is the actual roofing finished but all the supporting structure, joists, etc., are gone and it is just the right which keeps it in place. This building is one of the original frame buildings of 1889 first erected in Elkhorn, saved from the fire of 1895, then moved here in 1897 when the present main building was erected. When the classrooms were constructed in 1943-44 the poor condition of the top floor evidently escaped notice. The ceilings in the classrooms are wallboard.\"\n\nThe roof referred to is not the roof on the main building but rather on an outbuilding which some years ago was converted into three classrooms. I have no doubt the roof could be re-inforced by installing extra rafters or taken off altogether and replace with all new material. I pointed out some year ago that the building was cold and might be greatly improved by two layers of paper, wired and stuccoed.\"\nI hardly think it necessary to send out a man from the Surveys and Engineering Branch just to check on this building but if there is other work in this Province for which his services are required then this could be done at the same time.\n\nA.G.

Any violation of the terms set forth in the Bond renders it void and useless.\n\nThe above instructions should be placed in a prominent place for the attention of all members of the staff and for the information of any future principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

This was ordered from Ashdown's in August but I am told was not available.\n\nRev. Dixon, Principal of the School, is anxious to obtain the wire screen as soon as possible in order that the windows can be put in shape before the flies and mosquitoes get bad. I am advised by Ashdown's that at present there is none in stock but a shipment is expected.\n\nThe original quotation was based on a 12 Mesh Black Wire and was priced at $7.50 per 100 feet. It is doubtful this size mesh is in production but if it is the price will be $8.50 per 100 feet. I understand the 12 size mesh is being replaced by what is known as a 16 x 12 mesh and the price of this is $10.00 per 100 feet.\n\nI would like permission to purchase 5 rolls or better - it might be advisable for the Purchasing Agent to make the purchase. The requirements are 5 - 100 foot rolls of 30\" wire screen, 12 mesh if available; if not 16 x 12. Shipment should be made to Rev. Dixon, Elkhorn School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

However, the firm did not deliver the wire.\n\nMr. Hamilton stated that it is doubtful if 12 mesh wire is in production and if it is, the price will be higher than the one mentioned above. Mr. Hamilton further advises that the 12 size mesh is being replaced by what is known as 16 x 12 mesh; the price of this is stated to be $12.00 per hundred feet.\n\nIn view of this information we have requested you to secure either No. 12 mesh or if that is not available, 16 x 12 mesh.\n\nWe are anxious to secure this as soon as possible so that the necessary screens may be made before the flies and mosquitos become prevalent.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the kitchen range at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, you may engage Mr. Ziegler to remove the range and provide a proper base for it. The Department will depend on you to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn the last report submitted by the Provincial Fire Inspector in connection with the Elkhorn School he recommended that the kitchen range be placed on a cement base. Mr. Ziegler of the Central Sheet Metal Works, Brandon, looked the situation over late last fall when he was putting a new roof on the school but was unable to determine just what work would be required to carry out the Inspector's instructions.\n\nWhen I was in Brandon this week I interviewed Mr. Moody, Fire Inspector, in company with Mr. Ziegler and he is still of the opinion that his recommendation should be observed. He would like the stove removed and a proper base provided by placing first - a sheet of asbestos over which there should be placed a sheet of metal and he requests that this be covered with 2 or 3 inches of strong cement. Mr. Ziegler is prepared to do the work but he is unable to give a price. The stove will have to be disconnected from the hot water tank and it may be necessary to take out some of the floor and put in some reinforcement before the cement can be put down.\n\nMr. Ziegler stated he was prepared to do the work, if so instructed, and would submit his account showing prices and quantity of material used. He would also submit time sheets in regards to hours and rate of pay. The Department, of course, are aware that it may be necessary for Mr. Ziegler to make two trips from Brandon to Elkhorn, a distance of around 65 miles one way, and, of course, he will expect all expenses both in relation to board, room and mileage.\n\nI would appreciate authority to engage Mr. Ziegler to carry out this work as recommended by the Provincial Fire Inspector.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

However, the trip East appears to be indefinite and I consider it advisable to forward at once the following report. The repairs needed are as follows:\n\n1. The lower slope of the mansard roof, which is covered with metal roofing, is rusted - the original paint has practically all disappeared. This portion of the roof requires painting. The boards under the eave have rotted and in places some of the boards have fallen off. The eaves should be repaired before the roof is painted.\n\n2. The Principal states it was impossible to heat the school during the past winter. It is my understanding that the present boiler was installed years ago - since then the west wing has been added to the building, which undoubtedly overloaded the capacity of the boiler. Some few years ago one section of the boiler sprung a leak and instead of renewing the section it was closed off, which procedure further increased the load on the remaining sections of the boiler. I have no doubt a new boiler is needed. I would recommend that a qualified engineer visit this school and make a thorough investigation of the heating system and report on the advisability of a new boiler.\n\n3. Many windows are loose which, of course, makes it more difficult in the winter to heat the school. Satisfactory results might be obtained by the use of material known as Flexotite.\n\n4. The classrooms, three in all, are in a building detached from the main residence. This building needs extensive repairs and I would recommend that a qualified engineer inspect the school and submit a report. The roof leaks in numerous places. In my opinion the composition roofing is finished and should be removed and where necessary new rafters and roof boards be supplied. The entire surface then should be recovered with a built-up asphalt roof. The windows need repairing and refitting. This work must not be neglected longer, otherwise, the interior walls and ceiling will be destroyed.\n\n5. A new coal shed is needed. The present building is useless and should be wrecked.\n\n6. Repair work is needed on all the barns. New doors should be made and properly hung. The ceiling in the cow barn should be renailed and a quantity of new boards supplied.\n7. The linoleum on the steps leading from the basement to the dormitories is breaking in many places - right angle metal should be supplied so that the edges of the linoleum can be fastened down. The use of such metal would lengthen the life of the linoleum many years.\n\n8. The chesterfield in the staff sitting room is in a disgraceful condition and I am sure past repairing. I would recommend that a new chesterfield and two well built occasional chairs be supplied.\n\n9. The Principal's residence needs exterior painting - both the roof and the walls. I have just now received a quotation from Mr. Baker of Elkhorn covering this work, as well as the painting of the school roof referred to above in section one. I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Baker's quotation.\n\nI know this list of repairs and requirements is long and will involve considerable expense. However, the Department is well aware that this is an old school and has reached the stage where extensive repairs cannot be avoided. I have listed the major requirements and recommend that all be favourably considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

Will you kindly advise us of your wishes in this matter.\n\n2/9/47\n\nIndian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of June 18, 1947, in connection with the above, you are advised that we are in receipt of survey plans and a report dated July 26, 1947, prepared by Mr. W.H. Wallace of Mr. Dew's office.\n\nThe present gravity system of hot water heating is of ancient vintage, and the piping system is one of mediocre design. The boiler has apparently outlived its usefulness and for a considerable time has been operating below its capacity on account of one damaged section, which has had to be disconnected. The addition of the new wing at the west end of the building has further increased the load which this boiler is required to handle.\n\nAfter having given thorough consideration to the requirements based on Mr. Wallace's data, it is our opinion that the piping system need not be replaced but minor alterations in the boiler room will be necessary.\n\nWe have checked over the radiators in each and every room in the building, and find that in most cases they are of sufficient size and in some cases, oversized. It is not our intention however, to reduce the size of any of these units. The existing piping system is of a design which cannot be expected to provide circulation to all parts of the building by gravity. Even if the boiler was sufficiently large, proper distribution would be difficult to obtain.\n\nWith up-to-date technical data relative to the laws governing the flow of hot water and with the development of new and efficient circulating pumps and controls of proven efficiencies, it is felt that instead of tearing out the existing piping system, a satisfactory solution could be obtained by converting from a gravity flow to a forced circulated system by the use of a few items of modern equipment.\n\nWe are, therefore, recommending that the following operations be carried out in order that the building may be properly heated:\n\n1. Remove existing boiler and replace with new square sectional cast iron hot water heating boiler of sufficient capacity.\n\n2. Recondition existing stoker carrying out repairs which may be necessary and reset under new boiler.\n\n3. Install new centrifugal type circulating pump of the proper capacity for the purpose of circulating water at a rate calculated to carry heat to all parts of the building.\n\n4. Provide and install necessary elementary controls in connection with stoker operation, circulating pump operation and boiler protection.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n5. Provide and install additional return piping required in connection with improved circulation.\n\n6. Supply and install square head cocks on each return line with permanently located thermometers, thereby making it possible to equalize circulation to all parts of the building.\n\nSince this school was built in 1897, it is more than likely that windows and doors could be weather-stripped to advantage. It is recommended that this operation be carried out.\n\nApart from this weather-stripping, we have estimated that the revisions to the heating system will cost in the neighborhood of $5,000, and when advised by Indian Affairs to proceed, we will issue plans and specifications to Mr. Gov., asking him to obtain prices and submit same to this Service for consideration.\n\nIt is pointed out that delivery on the boiler and some other items may be eleven to twelve weeks, and if it is desired to complete this work in time for the coming heating season, an early decision should be reached.\n\nIn connection with the day school building, we would recommend that no work be done.\n\nMr. Wallace's report concerning this building which incidentally is now 30 years old, is not encouraging. It is our considered opinion that the expenditure of a large amount of money which would be required to make this building fit for service is not justified.\n\nWe suggest, therefore, that Indian Affairs consider the erection of a new two-classroom building to replace the present structure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\n5000 information\n\nbusiness worth\n\nCol Murray\n\nPP\n\nFeb 147\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Painting Elkhorn School\n\nThe paint purchased for the outside of the school last November amounted to 18 gallons of Tuskin Red Paint priced at $3.61 per gallon and this amount was for a one-coat job. The Department has authorized a two-coat job.\n\nMr. Baker was to 'phone me when the one coat had been applied and state the amount of paint required to do the second coat. While waiting for this paint he will proceed with the painting of the house.

Having analysed the report, plans and specifications were prepared by this Service and Mr. Gow was requested to obtain tenders for the work outlined therein. The following is a condensed summary of the proposals received from Mr. Gow:\n\n| Firm                        | Location       | Price          | Proposal                                      |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Yates and Company           | Brandon, Man.  | No estimate    | Contract or time and material.                |\n| Relf Plumbing & Heating     | Brandon, Man.  | Not stated     | Cost plus 10%                                 |\n| Neale, Stothard & Chapman   | Brandon, Man.  | $5,260.47      | Firm tender for immediate acceptance          |\n| John Plaxton & Co., Ltd.    | Winnipeg, Man. | $6,150.00      | Cost plus 10%                                 |\n| Randall & Co., Ltd.         | Winnipeg, Man. | $6,551.00      | Firm tender for immediate acceptance          |\n\nIt is our considered opinion that Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman, have offered the most favourable proposal. Our own estimate for this work was $8,000.00.\n\nSince Yates and Company and Relf Plumbing & Heating give no estimate of the cost in their proposals, it is felt that their prices could conceivably exceed the firm tender of $5,260.47, on a cost plus 10%, or time and material basis.\n\nIt is pointed out that Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman, reserve the right to invoice materials at the time of delivery, which would increase their figure, if prices over which they have no control increase. This is in line with Dominion Government policy which states that a contractor shall not be penalised owing to price changes, over which he has no control, which may occur between the time a tender is accepted and deliveries of materials are made.\n\nTherefore, it is our recommendation that this work be awarded to Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman, on the basis of their firm tender and that a memorandum be prepared to cover same.\n\nJ. M.

We will arrange to pay this account; however, you should point out to the principal that when repairs are required he should correspond either directly with the Department or with Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg.\n\nThe main point for the Principal to keep in mind is that authority for any expenditure should be obtained before the expenditure is incurred.\n\nAs you know, we are expected to purchase materials through our Purchasing Branch and as a matter of fact we will have to obtain a purchase order before we can pay the account which you forwarded.\n\nThis is sometimes difficult because as you can readily understand, the Purchasing Branch feels that we are ignoring Departmental regulations when we do not submit the request to them before the purchase is made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

A new 800-gallon boiler is needed.\n\n(b) Manual Training Shop\n\nA building 30' x 25' x 8' is needed. Approximate cost of materials - $1,500.00\n\n(c) New Roof on School Block\n\nPlans and estimates have been prepared by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources.\n\n(d) New Electric Motor\n\n1 H.P. single phase 110-220 volt, 60 cycle, 1725 R.F.M., stoker motor is continually breaking down.\n\n(e) Fencing Material\n\n5000 fence posts\n6 rolls barbed wire\n2 single 14' farm gates\nWe shall be glad if you will provide for as much of the above work as you possibly can in your 1948-49 Estimates.\n\nThe Principal reports that, as tenders have already been sent to your Branch covering the installation of a new heating system, he has not included this item.\n\nI understand that you propose to use the $500 provided in your current year's Estimates for the heating system mentioned in the preceding paragraph. If there is sufficient balance remaining after the heating system is installed, will you please give consideration to the early provision of the new hot water boiler mentioned in (a) above instead of deferring this until the next financial year. I am sure you agree that a leaky hot water boiler beyond repair should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

My suspicions were proven a few days ago when the 'short' occurred in the boiler room and would have been much more serious had it not happened that the Farmer walked into the room when it was still dark in the morning and spotted the trouble between two sheets of the tin on the ceiling. I am very thankful no damage was done.\n\nI would also like to report that the Engineer and I made a thorough test of all fire stations, doors and bells yesterday adjusting the bells to give a maximum ring but there was the one at the head of the main front stairs on the second floor was, even after we tried to adjust it, very poor. Otherwise everything operated satisfactorily but we noted the bells were scarcely audible in the two dormitories on the second floor, if the communication doors were closed.\n\nIn closing may I remind you that I am in urgent need of some more 'blue sheets'.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MEG\nMr. Miller\n\nI am attaching copy of Order in Council P.C. 5130, dated December 16, 1947, which provides for the acceptance of the tender furnished by Neale, Stethard and Chapman, Brandon, Manitoba, in the matter of revisions and additions to the existing hot water heating system in the Elkhorn Indian Residential School in the Province of Manitoba, to the amount of $5,260.47, with provision for contingencies and supervision to a total of $6000.00, said expenditure to be met from the appropriate vote of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Bignell and Councillor Constant from The Pas Band called at my office December 30th and complained re conditions at Elkhorn School - conditions, which they stated, developed since Mr. Dixon left. They were leaving that night for Elkhorn and I promised I would inspect the school during the first week in January. I have just returned from my inspection today. The complaints listed by the Chief and Councillor were as follows:\n\n1. Clothing poor - supply of socks insufficient - no rubbers, no mitts, no overshoes for the girls - no caps for the boys.\n2. Children with head lice.\n3. No proper toilet soap and as the water is very hard the children's hands were rough and sore.\n4. The milk was like water and the supply very limited.\n5. Food in short supply - no butter or eggs.\n6. Girl's feet froze and had to be amputated - another girl froze fingers and nails came off.\n7. A boy punished and not fed for two weeks.\n8. No lard or butter on the table.\n9. Parcels sent to kids not delivered when received.\n10. Jam etc., spread too thin.\n11. No change of clothing since Mr. Dixon left.\n12. Bedding not clean and no pillow cases.\n\nI will report on the complaints in the order as set down above:\n\n1. Children have stockings and socks. Boys wear boots but neither boys nor girls have rubbers nor overshoes. None of the senior boys are provided with heavy gum rubbers - a type of footwear usually provided at all schools. I consider rubbers and overshoes essential.\n2. Both boys and girls have had head lice and boys also have body lice. The girls are reported clean now - the boys are not in this fortunate condition. This condition should not exist.\n3. Toilet soap is usually supplied but there is none at present. There is liquid soap and chunks of pink and white Castile soap but the children claim the soap is strong and in hard water it makes their hands rough and sore. A good toilet soap (hard water) should be provided.\n4. The supply of milk amounts to about 80 pounds a day or 32 quarts. The milk is from Holstein cows and after it is put through a separator it looks like milky water. The children do not get the equivalent to a cup a day, in fact, scarcely enough for the morning porridge. Dry whole milk should be supplied to supplement for that produced at the school. All children should have at least a cup at noon instead of cold water and, in addition, enough for their porridge. It should be whole milk\u2014not skim milk.\n\n5. The short supply of food to me appeared as follows:\n\na. No butter\nb. Lard\u2014but spread on too sparingly\nc. Jam, peanut butter etc.,\u2014used too sparingly.\n\nI think the children get enough potatoes, bread and stew with a fair amount of good meat. They get no eggs, canned tomatoes or raw fruit.\n\n6. Two girls ran away from the school and when found it was discovered that the one girl had her foot badly frozen. The toe nails came off but are growing back on and the skin is healed and appears healthy. The other girl's fingers were not frozen enough to require any medical attention.\n\n7. The boy referred to was punished by the Principal and sent to bed without supper. He only missed one meal.\n\n8. Lard is spread on the bread before it comes to the table.\n\n9. One parcel though to be a Christmas present was kept until Christmas and then handed out with other Christmas parcels. This parcel was not meant for Christmas and, of course, should have been given as soon as received.\n\n10. Jam and other spreads issued too sparingly.\n\n11. Clothing is changed each week\u2014on bath night.\n\n12. Boys' sheets washed one week and the girls' the next week. A few pillow cases are missing. I understand the allotment ran short but a new supply is expected.\n\nI think most of the trouble is due to staff shortage and unless a change takes place I am sure many of The Pas Indians will take their children home. Councillor Constant took his four when he left on New Year's day. There should be no delay in appointing:\n\n1. A Principal, who understands and is sympathetic towards children.\n2. A Matron, with practical nursing experience.\n3. A Laundry Matron.\n\nUnless the above staff is supplied I know we cannot please the parents nor can we keep the school repaired and clean.\n\nOn the boy's side one toilet is broken and two others loose and leaking. All the clothes hooks are broken off the wall. The bathtubs on the boy's side are very dirty and the new ones installed a couple of years ago now look as bad as the old ones. Many of the bed springs are sprung and badly broken and should be renewed.\n\nThe Boy's Supervisor, Mr. Stone, is not well and in my opinion physically unfit to stand the work and the strain of his position. He is sincere and anxious to do well but the position demands an active healthy man.\n\nI consider three fire extinguishers necessary\u2014one for the furnace room, one for the engine room and one for the supply room located in the basement.\n\n\u2014over\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 10)\nThe sewing machines number six and all have been repeatedly repaired for years until now they are almost useless. I recommend that two machines be supplied.\n\nThe floors are very bad in the boy's playroom, sewing room, dormitories and in the kitchen. New floors are required - in some instances perhaps they can be covered with Battleship linoleum.\n\nIn the Grade 2 classroom the following is needed:\n\nGrade 2 Readers (W.J., Gage & Co.)\n\n24 Friends and Neighbours\n24 More Friends and Neighbours\n24 Workbook for Friends and Neighbours\n24 Workbook for More Friends and Neighbours\n15 ft. Good Blackboard slating\n\nIn the kitchen sufficient hot water is not available. A second hot water tank should be attached to the range - to do this we will require a water front for a McClary Chief Range and a tank. It will be necessary to engage a plumber to make the installation.\n\nMrs. Scott, the cook, requested that sufficient masonite be supplied to cover the work tables and also requested a new sink for the table.\n\nMr. Stoddart is sincere but I think cannot measure up to the responsibility or is afraid to act, fearing he has no authority. There is some clothing on hand, but he states Mr. Dixon told him it was for next fall. He also has a fair amount of jam and peanut butter etcetera but, again, appeared afraid to make any change such as to use an extra can of jam or extra lard. The dry milk purchased by the Commission has all been used yet no effort made to replace at once - the children go without. There should be supplied at least - 75 to 100 pounds of dry milk per month along with what is produced on the farm.\n\nAs I said Mr. Stoddart is doing the best he can but in my opinion this is not good enough. He was not aware that the horses and cows were all kept in one barn and that the horse barn was not in use. He failed to give me within ten of the total in residence. He was not aware that a girl attending the town High School wrote Christmas exams and, in fact, failed in some of her subjects.\n\nI pointed out a cardboard basket full of paper and waste matter in the boy's dormitory and requested it be removed and a tin container provided. The next morning the box was still untouched. I also warned Mr. Stone of the fire hazard and he promised to carry out my request.\n\nI do not think any school can be run long without a principal, a matron and a laundry matron. Unless these positions can be filled without delay I am afraid some of the present staff, already overworked, will leave and if this happens I fail to see how the school can be kept in operation. I consider the situation serious and the needs listed above must be met and without delay.\n\nI probably should add, not as any threat but merely as information given to me in a statement by Chief Bignell, namely, that if there is no change in two weeks he will take his children home and so will many others. These Indians are fairly intelligent and the Chief reasonable, but I firmly believe he means business and will not hesitate to remove his children.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. Neary.\n\nI was at Elkhorn School yesterday, with Mr. Neale, of the firm of Neale, Stothard & Chapman. We found the Chief McClary heavy duty range in serious need of repair. Both fire boxes need relining and one a new water-front.\n\nThe flat rim sink, located in one end of the work table, is badly chipped, and leaks. This enamel flat rim sink should be replaced.\n\nThree toilet bowls need to be installed. Crane's have just shipped the six complete units, which order was placed by Ottawa last April. The present water closet flush tanks are copper, and placed on the wall near the ceiling. These are past repairing, and this type cannot be replaced. The china watertanks, as you no doubt know, break very easily. I have tried to locate steel, two coat enamel, low-down tanks, hoping to make an exchange, but none are available at present. If Mr. Neale can locate, and supply the steel watertanks, may I allow him to take, in exchange, three of the china tanks now on hand? The steel enamel coated tanks may chip, but will not break, and in my opinion, are the only ones suitable for any of our schools.\n\nYou will note, the cost with board, is given as $275.00. Mr. Neale told me that this may vary slightly, due to the necessity of making changes in material, and unforeseen difficulties in repairing old, out-dated equipment. In view of the amount of money involved, I would like approval by wire.\nThe water front I purchased from General Steel Wares, and that will be extra. It will amount to about $50.00.\n\nIn a repair job of this nature, where the equipment is old and out-dated, it is difficult to get a definite quotation.\n\nI would appreciate having authority to do this work, on the understanding that the total expense will not exceed $325.00, in relation to plumbing, repairing the range, and supplying additional hot water.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncls.\nThis is the water tank supplied in china, but which I wish to exchange if possible, for steel with two coat enamel. If obtainable, may I make the exchange? Cranes have none of this type. General Steel Wares expect some.\nFeb. 4/48.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Industrial School\n\nWe are pleased to quote as follows:-\n\nTo--re-lining two fireboxes for the present Range and installing Owner's water front in same.\n\nTo--install one No. 82, equal to 63 imperial gals.

Archdeacon H.G. Cook,\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI quote hereunder from a letter just received from the Acting Principal of our school at Elkhorn, Man.\n\n\"Your instructions re repairs etc. was a little late as I had already paid for the Motor and one of the grates. However, I will take the matter up with Inspector Hamilton.\n\nThe grate for the Farm Cottage is on the Beaver Lumber account. I will ask them to give me a separate account for it.\n\nI broached the subject of repairs being paid for by the Department to Mr. Hamilton in this manner.\n\nWe require a new Automatic Control on the water pump motor. After getting a line on one with Marshall-Wells Co. at a price of $19.00 I wrote Inspector Hamilton to this effect, expecting him to order it, to which he replied:\n\n\"Small repairs of this nature are usually considered the responsibility of the School Management. If the control is needed, I suggest you order it at once, and in forwarding your voucher, send a covering letter stating the control was a necessity and urgently needed.\"\n\nTo date the control has not arrived though it has been ordered a week or more. From this information I gather it is not quite clear as to who should pay for small repairs, specially as far as Inspector Hamilton is concerned. The forementioned along with the Engineer's requisition, will amount to considerable and I think I should wait your advice on the matter.\"\n\nI am informed by General Turner that in discussions with you it seemed clear that your Branch is prepared to accept responsibility for all essential repairs and maintenance (but not \"frills\") in Government-owned Schools. It appears, however, that Inspector Hamilton is under the impression that this\n\n(over)\nAdministration is responsible for all minor repairs and maintenance services and, as you know, the cost of a number of minor services soon amounts to a considerable sum. I would like to suggest, therefore, that definite instructions to Agents and School Principals on this subject would be very desirable as they would clarify the situation and all parties concerned would know exactly what the Department is prepared to do regarding repairs and maintenance.\n\nIn the meantime, it will be appreciated if you would instruct your agent to look after the account for the grate for the Farmer's Cottage and the Automatic Control for the water-pump, and also if you would be good enough to reimburse us for the cost of the Motor and Grate already procured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nActing Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 10)\nFebruary 11, 1948.\n\nDear Archdeacon Cock:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, file Elk.2, we are writing to Mr. Hamilton with reference to the grate for the farmer's cottage at the Elkhorn School and the automatic control for the water pump.\n\nYou may submit for our consideration the account covering the cost of the motor and grate already secured.\n\nTo the extent that funds will permit, we are prepared to pay for essential repairs and maintenance in Government owned schools. However, we feel that when repairs are required, the principals concerned should either communicate with their agent, the inspector for the province or for that matter, they can write direct to this office, although we would prefer the application to come through either the agents' or the inspectors' office.\n\nMany principals assume authority for repairs and several weeks later forward the account or write to the church concerned regarding the expenditures they have made. This procedure is very unsatisfactory as far as we are concerned.\nWe always try to deal fairly with those applying for authority for legitimate expenditures but I think you will agree that it is impossible for us to control our appropriation if principals or others incur expenditures without first receiving authority.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

She found the children had badly infected mouth condition, and in need of a mouthwash. Dr. Wood supplied the mouthwash, but Nurse Snary stated the children hadn't any cups to use. I have inquired, and can secure from Ashdown's, eight ounce plastic tumblers, at 15\u00a2 each. I would recommend the purchase of 150, total cost $22.50. The nurse considers it impossible to cure the mouth condition if ten or fifteen children are allowed to use the same cup. I believe these tumblers are essential and recommend the purchase.\n\nOpal enamel cups are available at 26\u00a2 each, and heavy plastic mugs at the same price. I mention these in case the Department considers them more suitable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nFebruary 23, 1948.\n\nMr. A.G.

If you were to look up Inspector Moore's report, you would get an idea of the situation. He is the Department of Education's Inspector for this District. Then again we have no Hospital in the Village now as Dr. Johnston has had to close his due to the lack of help, which means that if we have any cases of sickness that require isolation or special attention, we have no ward for them. The Junior Classroom is now in what used to be the Hospital section of this building. Hence we really need a building with four classrooms.\n\nI would be pleased to give you any other information I can on the Matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.A.B.

Our Night Watchman\nhas been off sick twice lately for several days,\nand last night we had to take him home about half\nway through his shift, he will likely be off for\na week at least, I have already paid out $10.00\nfor a relief man. He is an elderly man, lives\nwith his wife in town, and as he only gets $40.00\na month, I feel that he should not have to pay for\nthe relief man. However, I do not imagine the\nAdministration will feel that they should either.\nWould you kindly advise. Possibly he could be\nallowed sick leave as I understand he has been\non this job since 1944, and with the exception of\na few nights in a season, has always been on the\njob.\nOttawa, March 29, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Stoddart:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of March 17th in which you referred to the night watchman at the Elkhorn School.\n\nThe Department has been making an allowance of $40.00 a month towards the salary of the night watchman at your school.\n\nI regret that it is not possible to increase this amount during the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.A.B. Stoddart,\nActing Principal,\nElkhorn Indian Res. School,\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttached please find copy of a letter received from Mr. D. A. B. Stoddart, Acting Principal, Elkhorn Indian Residential School, Elkhorn, Manitoba, which is self-explanatory.\n\nAs Mr. Hamilton's return is indefinite I am forwarding this letter for your information and attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Hamilton,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for the copy of the letter from the Department at Ottawa relating to the Engineer's requisition.\n\nAs I mentioned in one of my letters of recent date, we are anxious to know if we can expect any repairs done to the coal shed, in the near future. We will very soon have it empty, and must shortly order coal to build up our reserve, but if it is not repaired it might collapse before another chance to repair it would come around.\n\nWe have the motor for the Freezing unit to repair soon, as it will require to be put to work again soon. Will it come under the same category as the Stoker Motor? If so will you please authorize me to send it in?\n\nOn point of information too, our night watchman has been off duty through sickness twice this winter and I have paid out $10.00 for a relief for him. Then last night or early this A.M. he took sick again and we had to take him home in the car. I expect we will have to get someone to take his place, possibly permanently. Could you give me any idea of my authority in this respect? I understand he is actually paid by special grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. A. B. Stoddart,\nActing Principal.\nOttawa, March 30, 1948.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, we do not appear to have received any recent correspondence regarding the repairs required to the coal shed at the Elkhorn Residential School.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Elkhorn School\n\nThe newly appointed Principal was expected to arrive in the near future, nevertheless, I visited the school.\n\nIt is rather difficult to describe the atmosphere of this institution - depressing would probably be the suitable word. The only bright spot was the kitchen and the staff room. The toilets were filthy and so were the dormitories. The Acting Principal can hardly be blamed as he could not make many improvements for he was expecting the Principal any day. It is rather an accumulation of many years of mismanagement than immediate negligence. I fear that the attendance will continually dwindle due to these horrible conditions. Toilet and bath facilities are inadequate. There are but four bathtubs for the girls while there are but three toilet bowls for the boys - exclusive of the one in the dormitory. I am satisfied that sanitary conditions of this school are a menace to health and are certainly not conducive to training these young people the importance of health.\n\nClassroom Block\n\nThe classroom is built over the root cellar. It is an old building that has been repaired many times. The foundation seems to be disintegrating, the central portion having dropped several inches. The roof leaks badly; the window sills are decayed; the lighting is unsatisfactory - the windows being placed far apart and are too small.\n\nThe hot-air furnace is in the root cellar. It can readily be imagined the odour being pumped into these rooms both summer and winter.\n\nIf this school is to continue to operate a classroom block of four rooms should be built immediately, while the interior of the main building should be completely done over.\n\nThere is one classroom in the main building. This junior room appeared well organized. The permit teacher, Miss Fry, is enthusiastic and has a pleasant personality. This Indian girl would make a splendid teacher should she take training.\n\nRepairs to the present classroom block would be a waste of money.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-5, part 10)\nWhile in The Pas the Indians seemed to complain bitterly about the condition of this school and apparently refused to send their children. For this they can hardly be blamed. Definitely something should be done and done immediately, to either better the conditions of this school or close it completely.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. J.

Canon\n\nA matter that is upper-most in my mind for immediate need is a small fresh-air unit, for the Principal's Residence.\n\nThe basement is so damp and unsatisfactory that food becomes contaminated soon after it is put therein. Possibly you know that if and when the sewage of the School and buildings \"backsup\" it does so into the basement of the said Residence. A small quantity of good food has already been wasted through warmth of weather and lack of keeping facilities. As an immediate solution; my wife is willing to put up the Cash, for a unit similar to the illustration attached, provided that you will put the purchase order through your channels for best discount. And also refund the purchase price to her in due course.\n\nI am not certain as to whether I should address this matter to you; if such does not come under your department, will you please urge the correct person to deal specially with this item, it is urgent to health and safety, as well as conservation of food.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev.

This work has been put in hand and I understand is nearly completed.\n\nWhen General Turner visited this school recently he found that additional work is needed to put this residence in reasonably habitable condition and he requested the Principal to obtain an estimate on this additional work. The Principal has now submitted an estimate (copy attached) procured from Mr. A.S. George, a local decorator, in the amount of $178.00.\n\nAs the work detailed on this estimate is necessary and by no means extravagant, I would be glad if you would authorize its execution at an early date. You will note that the sanding includes the sanding of floors in the Farmer's Cottage, which are in very poor condition.\n\nThe Principal reports that the kitchen cabinet and range for his residence have been received but that the floor covering for the kitchen and the refrigerator for this building have not yet arrived. Anything that you can do to expedite delivery of these two items will be appreciated.\n\nWill you please advise me as soon as possible of what you can do in regard to the above services.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G.

The present tank would appear to be dangerous. This school has now been closed and it is estimated that to put the school in any kind of shape the cost will be approximately $60,000.00.\n\nAlso enclosed is a fire inspection report which condemns the stairways and also suggests that the electric wiring be inspected by a qualified electrician. Will you please advise with respect to the reopening of this school in the month of September?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nDepartment of Labor\nWinnipeg\n332 Legislative Bldg.\n\nJune 24, 1948.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nAttn. Mr. A. G. Hamilton\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nDuring the course of a boiler inspection at the Elkhorn Indian School, Mr. Moodie, our inspector at Brandon reports that he noted a hot water tank 8' x 44\" dia. was leaking at the bottom back corner along the rivet seam. This has caused the bottom part of the shell to deteriorate.\n\nAlso, the tank and the jacket heater used for heating hot water in the tank is badly sealed. There is no means of entering this tank in order to clean the scale out or plugs in the jacket heater to provide for cleaning purposes. In view of the fact that this tank is approximately 20 years old, it is recommended that it along with the jacket heater be replaced with a new one.\n\nFor your information, there is the possibility of a plate in the jacket heater becoming overheated and if the circulation of the water were to stop, it would cause the pressure to rise in which an explosion may be the results.\n\nI trust that you will give this matter your immediate consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Del Begio,\nChief Inspector\nMechanical & Engineering Branch.\n\nCOPY\nJuly 15, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nWe received your letter of June 29th with reference to the Elkhorn Residential School. A copy of the letter from the Chief Engineer of the Mechanical Engineering Branch of the Department of Labour has been forwarded to the Lands and Development Services Branch, as the latter Branch is doing considerable work at the Elkhorn School at the present time.\n\nIn connection with the attached inspection report, it is considered that items (1) to (8) inclusive can be handled by the school management and that the expenditure involved will not be excessive.\n\nAs regards recommendation (9), the Department is prepared to allow an amount of $60.00 a month for a period of seven months during the heating season, towards the cost of a night watchman's wages. We are also prepared to supply a punch clock for him on receipt of a requisition from you stating the type of punch clock that you recommend be supplied.\n\nBernard F.

The building is not in fit shape to open at the present time. Requisitions will be going forward for this work for your consideration within a few days. The high pressure boiler will need refueling, and may cost in the neighborhood of $270.00. However, this depends on the number of things required when it is pulled down.\n\nMay I have authority to go ahead and get the boiler in shape, as owing to labor, it will take considerable time.\nJuly 30, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter of the 27th instant, file 209-ll A.C.E., the Department approves you making arrangements for the refueling of the high pressure boiler at the Elkhorn School. It is noted the cost will be approximately $270.00.\n\nYou may also arrange for minor repairs mentioned in your letter, namely replacing doors and glass, also painting and patching plaster. It is understood from your letter that this will not involve any heavy expenditure.\n\nWe do not understand your statement that the building is not in fit shape to open at the present time. While we know that the Elkhorn School is not in first class condition, it cannot possibly be in worse condition that it was at the end of June when the pupils were there and certainly it must be in better condition now than it was at that time in view of the work done under the direction of the Lands and Development Services Branch in installing a new heating boiler. You are also aware that the number of children to be accommodated this year is much less than last year. Consequently, we see no reason why the school should not reopen on September 1st and the principal of the Elkhorn School should be so advised.\n\nBernard F.

Neary.\n\nRe your signal dated August 19th regarding the repairs of over $400.00, requested by Rev. Mr. Woods of Elkhorn Indian Residential School. This school certainly is in bad shape, but owing to the fact that we are only going to use it for the next couple of years, we should not spend any more on it than absolutely necessary.\n\nI recently purchased some material for patching and cleaning up the walls, which will come to the amount of $272.54. I reduced Mr. Woods requests by more than half, and I consider the amount of paint and material for cleaning up, which I purchased, will only partly do the work.\n\nWhen ordering this paint I did not realize it would come to this much or I would have reduced it more. The authority to do this work was shown in your letter 106-0-5 (E.l). The voucher for this material is going forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n| Item Description       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| only Guardene Refills  | 6        | $3         | $18   |\n\nCERTIFIED\n\nELKHORN INDIAN SCHOOL\nSEP 4 1948\n\nCOPY\nDear Sir:\n\nThis bill is for Refills of Line Expenditures and I presume it is paid for by Indian Affairs Bc.\n\nKindly approve and send to Ottawa Office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Apparently your Salvage Officer had been labouring under the impression that it could be used elsewhere and for that reason I phoned you. According to my notes you said you would get in touch with the Salvage Officer and explain the situation to him and you intimated that you felt he would proceed with disposal on receipt of that explanation.\n\nI have just been advised by the Principal that this scrap is still lying where it was last August and that he has never been given authority to dispose of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

I shall be glad to be advised of the ruling you obtain in this case.\n\nReferring to the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph of the Secretary-Treasurer's letter of 20th December, I suggest that it can be argued reasonably that the education of Indian children is \"strictly Government business\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n\nGRT/BP\nELKHORN, MAN.  \nDecember 20, 1948\n\nRev. Canon H. G. Cook,  \nSuperintendent,  \nIndian School Administration,  \nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile: Elk-6\n\nI am in receipt of your communication of the 16th instant regarding the notice and demand for taxes for school purposes levied by the Village of Elkhorn against the Indian School Residence situated on part K-L, Plan 76, Village of Elkhorn, and note your suggestion that we send the notice to the Dominion Government as owners of the land.\n\nYou are no doubt aware as well as we are that lands owned by the Dominion Government are exempt from Municipal taxes as such.\n\nBut you should also be aware that the occupier of such lands is liable for taxation for school purposes, and as this point of law has been established for some years in this particular case at least, I am rather surprised to have it challenged in the present instance.\n\nYour files from the School here should show that this tax has been paid each year at Elkhorn since 1940 at least.\n\nAnd further than that, the Municipal Council has not the authority to exempt such property from taxation for school purposes when occupied for any other purpose other than strictly government business.\n\nI am sending the tax notice again to the Principal of the school here and trust that this will clear up the situation.\n\nYours truly  \nVillage of Elkhorn  \n\n(signed) Chas.

Webster, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nTown of Elkhorn,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Tax Notice\nResidence at Elkhorn\nIndian School\n\nReferring to the enclosed Tax Notice in the amount of $29.09, will you please be advised that this residence forms an integral portion of the school property owned entirely by the Dominion Government and I suggest that you send the tax notice direct to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n\nGRT/BP\nMEMORANDUM\n\nW. M. Cox\nLegal Advisor\n\nMarch 3rd, 1949.\n\nAttached hereto please find copies of correspondence between the M.S.C.C. and the Secretary-Treasurer of the Village of Elkhorn, Manitoba, concerning notice and demand for taxes for school purposes levied by the Village of Elkhorn against the Indian School Residence, which we discussed recently by telephone.\n\nIt is understood that where officers of the Crown occupy premises on behalf of the Crown, no tax is payable.\n\nIn the present case, however, the tenant is a teacher in the employ of the Missionary Society of the Church of England and therefore, not actually an officer of the Crown.\n\nThe maintenance of the institution, however, including the salary of the teacher is in fact provided for by a Government grant voted by Parliament as part of the appropriation for Indian education. Furthermore the school is under the general supervision of this Department. In a very material sense, therefore, it is considered that the premises are occupied on behalf of the Crown.\n\nYour advice, and if you consider it necessary an opinion from Justice on the question would be much appreciated.\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nIn March or April 1907 when land was being secured for the new Indian School here, a proposition was made for the exchange of the School farm and town property for other lands nearer the town and a portion of the town-site adjoining the new land, and was accepted. The School farm being considered a fair equivalent for the new lands, and the new townsite property also a fair exchange for the old lots.\n\nThe transfer as to farm lands was duly carried through and so was the townsite property so far as the Departments possession was concerned, but no equivalent has ever been given for it, as was agreed upon, and the old town lots have never been transferred in exchange, and they stand today in the name of the Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs. The town property acquired comprised some 45 acres and was owned by one Cavanagh, he having bought from the CPR Townsite Trustees some time previously, but was still owing a balance on it. I bought out Cavanagh paying him a very substantial figure and intended paying off the balance due the Trustees, when it occurred to me that perhaps if I represented the matter properly to the Trustees and the advantage that would accrue to their property here by the location of such a building on the townsite, they might be disposed to waive any further payment. This was I am sure a perfectly legitimate transaction and a business proposition, and I enclose copies of their letters referring to it. That my suggestion was agreed to is seen by the result and I do not see why the Department has not carried out its part of the agreement ere this.\n\nThe transaction with Cavanagh has cost fully $500, and as the money was borrowed is still increasing with interest, and I am anxious to have the matter closed up and the lots sold so that I can liquidate this debt, which is pressing at present. Had I not been able to affect that transfer from the Trustees, and to get their interest free I could not have come out even on the deal as the town lots were not worth more than the 45 acre land could not have been sold then to realise the amount, but I was so anxious to have everything smoothly so that the new School would be an assured fact that a small loss would not have been considered. It is surely time now that the matter was closed up. As the other land transactions were in the name of W. J. Wilcox and it may be thought advisable to have all in one name the present transfer can be made to him also, lest there may be no further undue delay in completing this, and I enclose a description of the town lots referred to.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant in connection with the transfer of property in connection with the Elkhorn school site. I was under the impression that the whole matter has been disposed of, for I gave instructions to that end in December 1898, and I was afterwards informed that everything had been done. I will at once have the matter looked carefully into; and you will be advised without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Cushing, Esq.,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\n(Signed) Clifford Lipton\nDear Rimmer,\n\nI send herewith a letter from Mr. Cushing of Elkhorn, and a copy of the Minister's reply. I was under the impression that this whole thing had been closed up by action which was taken by the Interior Department. I have looked at the file since receiving Mr. Cushing's letter; and it seems to me that the action of the Department of the Interior only provided for the transfer of certain Dominion land; whereas the agreement with Wilcox apparently provided that there should be also transferred certain lands held in the name of the Superintendent General as a site for the school. Would you kindly go into the matter and let me know how it stands, and take officially such action as is necessary to close the matter up.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\nDear Mr. Smart:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Cushing's letter referred to in Mr. McKenna's note to me below. The action of the Department referred to by Mr. McKenna was correct as based upon your letter of 30th March, 1897, to the former Indian Commissioner and the latter's letter to you of 27th July, 1898, on file 116,823-1. It seems to me to be possible that there has been some misunderstanding between either Mr. Cushing and the late Commissioner, on the one hand or between you and the latter on the other hand.\n\nMr. Cushing's letter of 23rd March, 1897, suggested purchase of 362 acres consisting of farm and town lands from the proceeds of sale of a section and Indian Home Town Lots. Your letter of 30th March, 1897, stated \"It does seem to me, however, that the giving of 640 acres for 362 acres ought not to involve any additional outlay by the Government although the 362 acres appear to be very well located.\" You clearly contemplated\n\nJ. A. Smart, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. Ottawa.\ncontemplated giving only the section for the 362 acres comprised of farm lands and town lands. On 5th June, 1897, Mr. Cushing wrote \"I understand that deed for the farm now held by the Department and the town property except lots 1, 2, 3, Block 3 will be issued in exchange for the other property.\" On 10th June, 1897, the Commissioner was instructed to go to Elkhorn and adjust price of property. He wired June, 25th 1897 \"have arranged for Elkhorn School site satisfactorily.\" On 27th July, 1898, the Commissioner asked to have the usual Order in Council passed vesting the farm in William J. Wilcox.\n\nIt seems to me that the Department was justified in believing that only 640 acres was to be given in exchange for the 362 and that it would be well to know whether you or Mr. Forget had any other understanding with Mr. Cushing.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\nDear Mr Forget,\n\nMr Cushing, of Elkhorn, has written the Minister saying that when land was being secured for the new Elkhorn school, a proposition was made for the exchange of the school farm and town property for other lands nearer the town and a portion of the town site adjoining the new land, and that this proposition was accepted, the school farm being considered a fair equivalent for the new lands and the new town site property also a fair exchange for the old lots.\n\nSuch a proposition was made by Mr Cushing in March '97 but the Deputy Minister does not appear to have agreed to it, as in a letter addressed to you on the 30th March of that year he states \"it does seem to me, however, that the giving of 640 acres for $352 acres ought not to involve any additional outlay.\"\n\nHis Honor,\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.T.\n\nRegina, N.W.T.\nby the Government, although the 362 acres appear to be very well located.\n\nThe Deputy Minister also states that he had no understanding as to any payment in addition to the farm, in either land or money and he has requested me to write and ask you what the understanding was when you visited Elkhorn to arrange the exchange.\n\nBelieve me dear Mr Forget,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSgd J. D. McLean\nDear Governor Forget,\n\nThere has been a misunderstanding as to the nature of the agreement made with Mr. W.M. Cushing, of Elkhorn, regarding the site for the Industrial School. An Order in Council was passed on the 30th December, 1898, setting forth that the Indian Commissioner acting in cooperation with the school authorities had arranged with Mr. Wilcox (for whom Cushing acted) to exchange Section 35, in Township 11, Range 29, West 1st Meridian, which had previously been set apart for the purposes of the Industrial school, for the South East quarter of section 5, Township 12, Range 28 West of the 1st Meridian, and the South West quarter of Section 4 of the same Township and Range, \"saving and excepting therefrom the land comprised in the railway right of way; and that\n\nHis Honor\nLieutenant Governor Forget,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe Commissioner had \"also secured\" for the school \"lots 1,2 and 3 in Block \"H\" and all of Blocks \"K\" and \"L\" in the Town of Elkhorn.\n\nIn accordance with the Order in Council title has passed to Wilcox for the said section 35, and the Department has taken possession of the two aforesaid quarter-sections and of the above described lots as well.\n\nMr. Cushing has again and again urged that Section 35 was taken in exchange for the two quarter sections solely; and that for the above described lots he was to be given in exchange the Town property vested in the Superintendent General for the school and described as lots 4 to 11 inclusive in Block 2, and lots 1 to 8 inclusive in Block 3. I find that in a letter of the 5th June '97 Mr. Cushing stated:\n\n\"I understand the deed for the farm now held by the Department and the town property, except lots 1,2 and 3, Block 3, will be issued in exchange for the other property.\"\n\n(I would here note that this exception of three lots is not mentioned in subsequent correspondence.)\ncorrespondence.)\n\nOn receipt of this letter from Mr. Cushing Mr. Smart wired you suggesting that you go to Elkhorn and arrange for the school site. On the 12th June, 1897, you wired \"have arranged for Elkhorn school site satisfactorily;\" and on the 27th July, 1898, you wrote the Department a letter on the subject, a copy of which I now enclose.\n\nIf you will refer to the copy you will see that you described the land for which you transmitted the titles to the Department as \"Firstly\" the two quarter-sections, and \"secondly\" the lots. And you went on to say that the land described under \"firstly\" had \"been transferred to Her Majesty in exchange for the old Elkhorn farm.\"\n\nThis bears out Mr. Cushing's contention that the section which formed the old farm was exchanged for the two quarter-sections. But you do not mention what the land described under \"secondly\" had been transferred to the Crown in exchange for; and hence the question arises were the\nthe lots described under \"secondly\" a free gift to\nthe Crown, or were they\u2014as Mr. Cushing alleges\u2014\ngiven in exchange for the Town lots vested in the\nSuperintendent General.\n\nThere does not appear to have been any\nformal agreement in the matter; and the correspon-\ndence of record in the Department fails to show\nclearly the terms of the understanding upon which\nthe exchange was effected. Neither does there\nappear to be a complete record in the Indian\noffice at Winnipeg. The inference is that the\nagreement which was made at the conference which\nyou had with Mr. Cushing at Elkhorn was not com-\nmitted to paper, and that through a clerical error\na paragraph was omitted from your letter of the\n27th July, 1898, which would have left no doubt as\nto the terms upon which the lots were secured.\n\nMy impression after carefully examining\nthe records is that the old farm was exchanged for\nthe two quarter sections solely, and that it must\nhave been intended to have given a quid pro quo\nfor the town lots, as a portion of the town pro-\nperty was, it appears, purchased from one Savannah\nby Cushing for the purposes of the transfer. The\n\nDepartment\nDepartment at a certain stage of the correspondence, however, took the position that the old farm was given as a full compensation for the town property as well as for the quarter-sections; and that position having been taken cannot now be abandoned upon the strength of an impression. The only way to dispose of the matter is to have from youa statement of the understanding which you had with Mr. Cushing.\n\nWould you, therefore, have the goodness to give me answers to the following questions:\n\n1. Was the section which formed the old farm given in exchange for the two quarter-sections merely?\n\n2. Was the town property which you also secured for the school a free gift?\n\n3. If not was there to be given in exchange for it the town property vested in the Superintendent for the school?\n\n4. If so, was the whole of the town property so vested in the Superintendent General to be given in exchange, or was there to be excepted from the transfer lots 1, 2 and 3 in Block 3?\nWest Mr. Cushing interviewed him. On his return he asked me to look into the matter, and on acquainting him with the result of my enquiry, he desired me to write you and ask you to kindly put him in a position to dispose of the question once for all.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sd) J.

Of course before we can do so we will require a quit claim from Mr Cavanagh of his interest in the property, also abstracts etc., to show that he has not dealt with it in any way.\n\nYours truly\n\n(signed) L. A. Hamilton,\nLand Commissioner.\nElkhorn Man., Oct. 7th 1906.\n\nSifton, Minister of Interior.\n\nIn March or April 1897 when land was being secured for the Indian School here, a proposition was made for the exchange of School farm and Town property for other lands nearer the town and portion of the townsite adjoining the new land, and was accepted. School Farm being considered a fair equivalent for the new lands, the new Townsite property also a fair exchange for the old lots. Transfer as to farm lands was duly carried through and so was Townsite property so far as the Department's possession was concerned, but no equivalent has ever been given for it, as was agreed upon, and the old town lots have never been transferred in exchange, so they stand today in the name of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The town property acquired comprised some 45 acres owned by one Cavanagh, he having bought from the C. P. R. Trustees some time previously, but was still owing a balance due for buying out Cavanagh, paying him a very substantial figure. I advised paying off the balance due the Trustees, when it occurred to me perhaps if I represented the matter properly to the Trustees, and the advantage that would accrue to their property here by location of such a building on the Townsite, they might be disposed to waive any further payment. This was I am sure a perfectly legitimate transaction and a business proposition, and I enclose herewith their letters referring to it. That my suggestion was not seen by the result, and I do not see why the Department did not carry out its part of the agreement are this.\n\nTransaction with Cavanagh has cost fully $800, and as the money owed, is still increasing with interest, and I am anxious to have this matter closed up and the lots sold so that I can liquidate the balance which is pressing at present. Had I not been able to get the transfer from the Trustees, and to get their interest paid, I could not have come out even on the deal as the town lots were worth more than the 45 acres and could not have been sold then for the amount, but I was so anxious to have everything go through so that the new School would be an assured fact that a small sacrifice had to be made. It is surely time now that the matter be closed up. As the other land transactions were in the hands of the Department, and it may be thought advisable to have it all closed up, a present transfer can be made to him also.\n\nThere may be no further undue delay in completing this matter and the description of the town lots referred to.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW. M. Cushing.\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nReferring to our short conversation in regard to the land acquired for the Indian School in addition to the farm property, I now enclose a copy of my letter to the Minister which I think fully covers the matter. I also enclose a rough draft of the land referred to. The School stands in about the centre of block B.\n\nYou will also find the description of the old town lots and Mr. Forget's letter. Of course I do not know what report he made in the case but I do know that he sanctioned the transfer in the presence of Mr. Wilson.\n\nCavanagh was paid $507.50 for his interest and I made the quit claim deed required by the Trustees and prepared the abstracts etc., and they in due course made over the property to the Queen as represented by etc., etc.\n\nNow that money was borrowed on the note of Mr. Wilson and myself and renewed from time to time for 21/2 years at 12 per cent and was then transferred to another Bank at 8 per cent where it has been for 9 months and is now being renewed for another 6 months. This makes about 3 1/2 years it has been running and with interest the salary is now $406.50 but the land is mighty cheap at that price to the Dept.\n\nAs to the town lots I do not want to touch them now as a transfer because I can't retire that note with them and just now they would not sell readily though easily worth enough to more than cover the cost of the other land.\n\nAnyway I wish you would look into this matter and get it cleared up.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brownlee, P.L.S., registered on the 8th November 1886, No 2939, the purchase price amounted to $1548.64, which was paid out of Parliamentary appropriation and the Deeds for the land were taken in the name of \"The Honourable the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, acting for the Department of Indian Affairs.\"\n\nIn 1895, a fire destroyed the buildings on the above site and arrangements were entered into for the erection of new buildings on a new site, which was subsequently secured, leaving the old site as above described undispersed.\n\nOn the 14th November 1900, the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg was requested to take such steps as he might deem necessary to dispose of the old Elkhorn school site, as the Department had no further use for the land.

The matter went no further.\n\nThese lands are not, strictly speaking, Indian Lands in the sense of having been paid for out of the Indian fund. They were paid for by money voted by Parliament and it is very questionable whether we, as a Department, are in a position to sell them without special authority being first obtained.\n\nWithout committing myself definitely as to our rights to\n\nJ.

Writer was in Winnipeg last week which delayed my reply. However, would say a lease for some years is not just what I would want. In the first place there are two old cellars, these must be filled up so that teams of lumber would drive over them. Then they must be fenced as they are right beside the road on the outskirts of the town and again I must erect a shed for storing mouldings, doors, etc., and would not care to do so on leased property.\n\nI can, however, appreciate your decision but they have lain idle for some six or seven years during which time not likely anyone has ever asked for them, for they are valueless as town property for building purposes but would suit me for a wood and lumber yard and I do not think anything done would be criticised by anyone who knew the property.\n\nNow I am willing to give $25.00 a lot for them and would be pleased to hear from you re same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) G. Silvester.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1903.\n\nDear Mr. Turriff,\n\nThe enclosed letter has been forwarded me but I cannot take action on it without knowing the contents of your letter of the 2nd ultimo.

I find that the Lots are not required for the purpose for which they were originally secured, but in the disposal of any property of this kind by the Department the invariable rule is to sell them by public auction, as you can readily understand that if any other course were adopted, the Department would come in for very severe criticism, as, irrespective of what prices we received for them, it would be made out that they were worth more. I think, however, that we might grant you a lease of them for a term of say, five years, at a moderate figure. You might advise me what you would be prepared to pay for a lease, and I will take the matter up with the Indian Department and endeavour to have it closed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

These Lots were acquired by the Department some years ago for school purposes but at present are not so used or needed. The rule in disposing of this kind of property is to do so by public competition, and this rule will have to be observed in this case.\n\nIt is quite possible that we might be able to arrange for a lease for a fixed period and if this will meet your wishes and you will communicate with the Department, stating such to be the case, I will take the matter up with this in view.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

I beg to say that on the 28th of April 1901, a rough sketch was forwarded to the department showing the proposed site for this residence. This was approved of by the Hon David Laird, Indian Commissioner who personally inspected the site July 22nd 1901.\n\nThe flooding of the basement is entirely due to the excessive amount of water there has been in the country since the house was erected. It was never expected that the water would ever reach the high mark it has done; otherwise we would have had the basement more above ground. The difficulty can be readily overcome by filling in the basement six inches with gravel and laying a new cement floor.

S. G. I. A.\nMr SCOTT.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to our conversation in Mr Wilson's office this afternoon, re certain lots in this Village which belong to the Indian Department & on which the first Indian School was situated; I might say that the lots are numbers 4 to II inclusive in Block 2 Registered Plan 2939 and 8 to 8 inclusive in Block 3 Registered Plan 2939. For a number of years these lots have not been used by the Department of Indian Affairs, and being non-assessable the Village has been losing a certain amount of revenue in the way of taxes each year. A few years ago I had some correspondence on behalf of the Village with the Superintendent of Indian Affairs regarding this, and he promised to look into the matter & write me further; but I presume that through pressure of other business this has slipped from his memory. The Village Council would be pleased to have you take this matter up with the Department & have the lots sold or deeded over to the Village; lots 1 to 8 in Block 3 would make an ideal little park for the Village & lots 4 to II would find ready sale at good prices if placed new on the market.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSecy Treas'\nVillage of Elkhorn\n\nIndian Affairs.

These lots were purchased on March 18th, 1891, by the Department for $1546.64 from Rev. Edward Francis Wilson, and are shown in Plan of Town of Elkhorn, being a subdivision of part of Sections 4 and 3\u00bd, in Townships 12 and 11, Range 28, W. 1st M., Manitoba, made by J. H. Brownlee, P.L.S., and registered on the 5th November, 1886, No. 2939.\n\nThe school building on these lots was burned in the year 1895, and as the new school buildings were erected on another site, an Order in Council was passed on the 23rd April, 1905, authorizing the sale of the said lots. The sale has been delayed from time to time owing to slackness in the demand for lots in the Town of Elkhorn.\n\nAs the trade in town property is now generally brisk in the West, I would suggest that the Department procure a copy of the above plan No. 2939, or a part thereof showing the 16 Lots in question, preparatory to advertising them for sale at public auction.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nRef. No. 116,823/22.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo. No. 116,823/22, re the School Lots in the townsite of Elkhorn which the Department intends to sell by public auction and about which certain information is desired before the property is placed on the market.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as I was in doubt, both as regards the valuation of said lots and the other information desired, I made due inquiry and herewith submit the information received, which I consider is fully reliable.\n\n| Lots   | Description          | Value |\n|--------|----------------------|-------|\n| Lots 4 to 11 | in Block 2         | $100.00 each |\n| Lots 1 & 2    | in Block 3         | $75.00 each |\n| Lots 3 & 4    | in block 3         | $60.00 each |\n| Lot 5        | in block 3         | $50.00 - |\n| Lots 6, 7 & 8 | in block 3         | $40.00 each |\n\nAs the lots are to be sold by public auction, it is likely that some of them may bring a much higher figure than that estimated, but on the other hand some may not sell for quite as much. I am, however, of the opinion that the approximate valuation of the said Lots, as given above, is reasonable.\n\nI would advise the auction sale being held at as early a date as possible, as intending purchasers would likely want to commence building operations as soon as Spring opened and there would be nothing gained by delay.\n\nIt is hoped that reasonable terms will be allowed on the lots to be sold, as it is considered that this would insure a more satisfactory sale in every way.\nIndian Industrial School,\nELKHORN, MANITOBA.\n\nI fully concur with the proposal that the sale should be held in Elkhorn and would respectfully suggest that it be advertised in the local paper \"The Mercury\", in addition to any other that the Department might deem advisable.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n(AUCTION SALE OF TOWN LOTS)\n\nThere will be offered for sale by public auction, subject to an upset price, at Elkhorn, in the province of Manitoba, on Wednesday, the 12th day of March, 1913, at 12 o'clock, noon, the following lots in Elkhorn townsite, namely, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, in block 2; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in block 3.\n\nThe terms of sale will be one-tenth cash and the balance in nine equal, annual instalments with interest at five per cent.\n\nAny information regarding the lots in question may be obtained upon application to the undersigned or to the principal of the Indian Industrial School, Elkhorn, Man.\n\nThe unauthorized insertion of this advertisement will not be paid for.\n\nJ.

H. Miller, who acted as auctioneer at the sale of the Elkhorn lots, I beg to point out that in letter of the 8th ultimo, authorizing Mr. Miller to act as auctioneer, he was advised that he would be allowed as remuneration for his services one-half of one per cent. of the purchase price, not to exceed the sum of $200.00; the total amount of sale is $1425.00, so that at this rate Mr. Miller's commission would be $7.12. On the 15th ultimo Mr. Miller wrote the Department stating that as these lots would not likely sell for more than $1240.00, which would make his commission only about $6.00, he thought he should be entitled to the usual commission of five per cent. on the first thousand, and 2\u00bd\u00a2 on all over one thousand, and he was informed that as regards remuneration for his services, the representations made by him would be given due consideration later.\n\nIn view of the fact that there were 16 parcels of land offered for sale, and all sold at the upset price or over, it is considered that the remuneration offered by the Department is low, and I would suggest that possibly Mr. Miller might be given $25.00 as compensation for his services.\n\nIn Charge Lands & Timber Branch.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Greenwood, Esq.,\nElkhorn,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that Mr S.J. Jackson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, when recently here inspecting the School, considered it advisable that additional land should be secured for cultivation and pasturage purposes and arrangements were therefore made for renting the E \u00a7 32 - 11 - 28 on terms of one-third crop payment.\n\nI believe this arrangement will prove an advantageous one for the Institution in every way, as the half-section in question lies adjacent to our Farm and is admirably adapted to meet requirements.\n\nIn view, however, of extending farming operations, the additional work that will have to be done on the School grounds and vegetable gardens this Summer, also the extra work that will be devolved on the Mechanical Instructor (Mr Goldie) in connection with installing laundry machinery, fitting up the new pumping station, when ready, and in doing numerous other tasks, that it will be advisable to retain the services of a Mr L. Hart this Summer to assist with the work generally, at a salary of $25.00 per month for the year.\n\nMr Hart is at present temporarily acting in the place of Mr S. Gore, who left on the 31st ultimo to accept a remunerative position in Winnipeg, but he has expressed his willingness to remain on the terms above mentioned.\nMr Hart is well educated and a good all-round man. He has had experience in farming, gardening, is a good mechanic and would be an acquisition to the staff.\n\nIt would be decidedly in the interests of both the Department and the School, if we were allowed to retain Mr Hart's services and I am satisfied that the results which would be obtained by having his additional help would more than compensate his salary.\n\nIt is felt by those in touch with the situation that additional help is needed under present conditions and I therefore hope that the Department will kindly consider my recommendation favourably.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n**THE WINNIPEG TELEGRAM**\n\nWinnipeg, Can., March 31, 1913\n\nTO THE TELEGRAM PRINTING CO., LIMITED\n\n| DAYS | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\n|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Daily | \u2713 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n| Weekly |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n\n**DUPLICATE**\n\n| DATE | No. of Lines | No. of Words | No. of Times | TOTAL NUMBER | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|\n|      |              |              |              | Lines        | Words  | $     |\n| March 8 | To Advertising Daily | 38 | 2 | 76 | 15 | 11.40 |\n| \" \" Auction Sale of Town Lots. | | | | | |\n| \" \" Readers | | | | | |\n| \" \" Weekly | | | | | |\n| \" Account Rendered | | | | | |\n| Part of order of Feb 1st 1913 | | | | | |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arrangements were therefore made for renting the East half of section 32, township 11, range 28, West of the first meridian, on terms of one third crop payment. This is the half section referred to in your memorandum and corners on the school property.\n\nIt might be well to see what success the school has had with the extended farming operations on this half section, before dealing with the question of purchasing it. In any event we should await the receipt of Mr. Jackson's inspection report.\n\nWhen making my memorandum on Mr. Wilson's application\napplication to retain the services of Mr. Hart to assist in farming operations I was not aware that the school would require this extra land. If you will be good enough to refer to Mr. Wilson's letter hereunder, dated the 23rd ultimo, you will see that he has given his reasons in full for wishing to retain Mr. Hart.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\nMarch 9, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been recommended to the Department that it would be advisable to purchase the land, namely, the east half of Section 32, Township 11, Range 28, now under lease for cultivation and pasture purposes for the Elkhorn industrial school.\n\nWill you please let the Department know at as early a date as possible who is the owner of this land and what it could be purchased for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA.

Macray, L.L.B. Winnipeg, is the owner of the east half of Section 32, Township 11, Range 28, and that it can be purchased at $25.00 per acre, total $8,000.00, providing the sale is made within a reasonable time.\n\nIt is pleasing to know that the Department is considering the advisability of purchasing this land, which is adjacent to our present farm and is admirably adapted to fully meet our requirements.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nD.C.

J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\ncould be able to work the additional property to advantage. You should also state whether additional expenditure would be entailed in the way of buildings and stock, and if so to what extent.\n\nKindly deal with this matter as fully as possible at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSIR,\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of the 1st inst., to hand and in reply.\n\nI am going up to inspect the Elkhorn Indian Industrial School on the 15th of April and will then be able to make you a full report on the subject of your letter.\n\nI might say now that the 320 acres of land attached to this school is of a very broken character. Without actually measuring I would say that where the buildings are situated say 60 acres there is from four to six inches of soil with solid gravel under for several feet. The back quarter section, 160 acres which is farmed has all the available land 131 acres broken up, the balance 29 acres is made up of small ponds which cannot under present conditions be used for grain. The balance of the land 100 acres is broken with small ponds and is required for the cattle. Most of the farmed land has been used for a number of years and it requires a considerable amount of Summer fallow in each year so they are up to their limit of crop now about 100 acres. That was my reason for recommending the purchase of the 320 acres across the road from the School Farm. The price was not high and the land is required for an Industrial School. If you will look at Statement No.11 attached to my report of May 29/12 you will see the building requirements then wanted and the only thing granted is a cottage for the Carpenter Instructor. About the first of May I will send you a full report on this if the land is still available. The new wing is a credit to the Department and the farm out-building should meet. In connection with this school I would recommend that Mr Wilson be instructed to accompany Mr. Logan and myself on our praying trip in the Manitowah Agency as far as Fairford and Lake St. Martins to get children. There is a good field for this school there which should be worked and neither the Agent or myself have time to do this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-9, part 1)\nApril 4th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson -\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the purchase of additional land for the Elkhorn Industrial School and I shall await the full report which you hope to be able to forward about the lot of Hay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS.

Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonecall, Ills.\nWith further reference to your letter of the 1st ultimo, re the purchase of the East half of Section 32, Township 11, Range 26 West. This half section has been recommended by me for purchase by the Department because they are short of land to properly carry on the work of this Indian Industrial School.\n\nWith a good farmer at the head of this department and with the number of large boys available for farm work the present area of arable land is not enough for the purposes of the school. The quarter section which is not farmed on has on it about 150 acres now broken up and as it is old cultivated land, at least fifty acres of this must be summer fallowed every year leaving only 80 acres available in each year for crop. The 160 acres on which the school buildings are situate has about twenty acres cultivated for potatoes and general farm produce. The school grounds proper consist of about sixty acres and this is light soil with solid gravel subsoil not suitable for general farming or gardening.\n\nThis leaves eighty acres for pasture and this eighty acres is badly broken up with small ponds and brush. Some of this land could be cultivated if pasture for the cattle were furnished by the new land to be bought. There is about 65 acres of broken land on the half section which will be put in crop this year, the same as last, the school paying one third of the crop as rent.\n\nThis school has now got a fine start in cattle having thirty-three head with prospects of increase to forty this year and they require a lot of land for pasture and for raising hay or green feed to keep their cattle fed during the winter months. They would have\nmade a fine showing on this farm last year if it had not been for a violent hail storm which struck their district on the 14th of August last. This hail storm reduced the yield at least one half. The books there show that over one hundred panes of glass were broken in the windows of the school and Principal's residence during the storm. The farmer told me that the land on this half section is of the very best quality and about 200 acres can be used for grain, the balance 120 acres, will come in very handy for pasture for the cattle. In the season of 1913 they had on this place 25 acres of wheat, 20 acres of barley and 15 acres of green feed with a yield of 462 bushels wheat, 233 bushels barley and 60 ton of green feed. Mr Waller who rents this place received in grain as rent to the value of $156.88, leaving the school double that as their share or $313.76, and this amount would have been doubled if the hail storm had not have struck them.\n\nFor some years I have been recommending certain new buildings for the Elkhorn School, new cattle barn, piggery, and cottage for the farmer, and these are required whether this land is bought or not. The only expenditure that the purchase of this farm would make necessary would be about four miles of wire fencing. I am sending you enclosed a rough pencil sketch showing the location of this half section. It lies just south of the quarter section on which the school raises all its grain. I would recommend that this half section be bought for the use of the school at a price not exceeding $25.00 per acre or in all $8000.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent\nGeneral of Indian Affairs,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nR. deW. Waller, Esq.\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter herein.\n\nTo whom is the option to be made? Is it to the King or to the Department of Indian Affairs? I think it would be better if Mr. Scott wrote me a letter stating the Department is prepared to purchase the land at $8000 payable on the first day of June next, and I write a letter agreeing to sell at that figure. I think however that they should pay interest from now till then.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"John A. Macray\"\n20th August 1914\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq'r Dept. Supt. Genl.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs instructed by Mr Jackson I wrote Mr Machray asking him for an option on the East half of section 32 - 11 - 28 at $8000 payable on the first day of June next, and I enclose you a copy of Mr Machray's reply. I think his suggestion is very fair, except the last clause - if you give him the third of the crop I don't see why you should pay him interest till then.\n\nI am writing Mr Machray stating this.\n\nI trust you will be able to settle the matter in this way.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Wilson,\nElkhorn,\nMan.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Additional Land for the Elkhorn School.\n\nI have been instructed by the Indian and Eskimo Commission of our Society to bring to your notice the necessity of having an adequate amount of land for farming purposes set apart for the Indian Residential School at Elkhorn, and to request you to kindly give this matter your earliest possible consideration.\n\nAt the present time this School has approximately 320 acres attached to it, less than half of which, owing to sloughs, bluffs, ground occupied by the scattered location of buildings, etc., is capable of being brought under cultivation. As a farm of this kind and area is quite incapable of producing the amount of grain, hay, and other green feed, roots, vegetables, etc., required for the upkeep of the School, I have been instructed to recommend to you that at least an additional half section of land be secured for this purpose.\n\nIn former years when this School was operated under the direction of the Diocese of Rupert's Land, it was found necessary to rent additional land from year to year. The adoption of a similar course now, however, is one which, for many reasons does not appeal with any favour to the members of our Commission and they hope that the land required may be secured through purchase.\n\nMr. J.A. Macray of Winnipeg owns a half section of land which is situated close to the present School property, and being suitable from the standpoint of grazing and cultivation, might be secured for this purpose. It is known as the East\nhalf of Section 32, Township 11, Range 28, West 1 M. Our Commission understand that the land is for sale on very reasonable terms, and would beg to recommend that steps be taken to secure it for the purpose mentioned in order that fences may be repaired or erected, and due preparation made of the fields with a view to securing a crop next year.\n\nAs Mr. Macray is at present away from the city our Commission are unable to furnish you with either the exact or even the approximate amount per acre which he would expect to receive, but they are of the opinion that $25. per acre would be a fair price.\n\nThe farm which adjoins the present School land on the West was offered for sale last year at the rate of $30. per acre if paid in cash, and at the rate of $35. an acre if paid on time. In taking these figures as a guide to the value at which owners assess their land in that district our Commission feel that the figure they have suggested would be both reasonable and just.\n\nCommending this very important question to your early and sympathetic consideration,\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/IMC.\nOttawa, July 14th, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the purchase of additional land for the use of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. It is noted that a half section of land which is situated close to the present school property and suitable from the standpoint of grazing and cultivation can be obtained for the sum of $25 per acre.\n\nIt will, however, not be possible to provide the amount necessary for the purchase of this half section from the funds at our disposal in the appropriation for Indian education during the present fiscal year. It is regretted, therefore, that the matter of the acquiring of more land for this school will have to stand over for future consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-45, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nAugust 14, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI visited the Kikern Indian Residential School on the 16th of July and was much impressed by the splendid condition of the main building and the principal's residence. There has been a complete renovation and a replacement wherever necessary and these two buildings are practically as good as new. The management has commenced putting the school grounds in shape and working the farm. I was considerably depressed by the nature of the soil on the school farm, and, upon making enquiry, I learned that it was extremely doubtful if any of the neighbouring properties would be of value. I learned that the M. S. C. C. had requested the Department to purchase a half section from a Colonel McRea. Mr. Menilly, the farm instructor of the school, does not consider the land suitable and not worth more than $10 an acre.\nElkhorn, Man. November 13/24.\n\nThe Superintendent Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour Department owns a considerable number of Lots in Blocks 2 & 3 in this Village which I believe you sold quite a number of years ago to various purchasers who made a small deposit and have probably paid nothing since.\n\nThese parties have never paid any taxes on the lots and the Village cannot get title to them under tax sale owing to the Indian Dept. being the registered owner. This causes considerable inconvenience as regards the tax accounts for the taxes are carried forward until cancelled and then start again and so on.\n\nI am writing you to see if there is not some way in which we can deal with these lands in some way by rental or otherwise so that we are not deprived of tax revenue therefrom.\n\nI understand from our Assessor that your Dept. made some arrangement with the authorities at Griswold, Man. along the lines I suggest. If you can suggest some method I shall be most glad to submit it to my Council.\n\nyours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSec-Treas.\n\nIndian Affairs.

P. Leslie\nJ.T. Frazer, Esq.,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI hereby agree to accept the sum of $14000 for my farm, namely the north half and southwest quarter of section five, and the north east quarter of section six in township twelve and range twenty eight west of the first principal meridian in Manitoba.\n\nThere are three hundred acres under cultivation on section five all reasonably clean, and there is eighty acres of summer-fallow in good shape for next season. Of the balance of the land, about seventy acres more could be put under cultivation, and the remaining land is fenced for pasture. The whole farm is also fenced, and cross fenced with two strands of barb wire, and the fence is in fair shape.\n\nThe buildings consist of the following; house with furnace, cistern and cement basement, barn 40 by 60, frame, roofed with shingles, has large mow. Implement shed 35 by 50, frame, shingle roof, hog pen 16 by 30, frame, granary 18 by 44, frame, roofed with shingles.\n\nThere is also a first class well with the best of water, and an abundance of it.\n\nThe north east quarter of section six is fenced on two sides with woven wire fence, and the balance of the fence is\nThe Superintendant,\nIndian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have recently been thoroughly over the farm owned and operated by J.P. Leslie, namely the north half and south west quarter of section five in township twelve and range twenty eight, and the north east quarter of section six in the same township and range. The farm is in a very good state of cultivation, and reasonably clean.\n\nMr Leslie is anxious to dispose of his holdings, and for cash will sell the section for $14000, and could give possession at any time, and in the event of a sale Mr Leslie would of course be given a month to vacate.\n\nMr Leslie prefers to sell the whole section because his buildings are on the three quarters of five. However if the section is too much land for you to handle he would sell the three quarters of section five for $10,800, or $22.50 per acre.\n\nShould you desire any more information in regard to this farm I will be pleased to submit it at any time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.T. Frazer\nDear Sir:-\n\nDuring the recent visit of Dr. Duncan C. Scott, the question of more land for this School was mentioned.\n\nDr. Scott suggested it would be wise to secure the help of a disinterested party to approach Mr. Leslie with reference to the sale of his farm, which joins the present School farm. With this in view, I consulted Mr. John T. Frazer of Elkhorn, and asked him to interview Mr. J.P. Leslie.\n\nI herewith enclose two letters, one from Mr. Frazer, the other from Mr. Leslie to Mr. Frazer. Will you be good enough to let me know if I am in order by sending this to you, or should I send it direct to Ottawa?\n\nAgain thanking you for your kindness and interest.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.

Eley, Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, which I thought you would like to see. Is there anything you wish me to do in connection with this matter? Is there any likelihood of the Department buying this land? If not, at the present time it will not be necessary for me to send an Inspector down to look it over. There is no doubt in my mind that they require additional land at the Elkhorn School, but it may be impossible to have an amount inserted in this year's Estimates to provide for the purchase.\n\nKindly return the enclosed letters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

This question will be given consideration when future estimates are being prepared. I may say, however, that there are many pressing claims on the Vote for Indian Education and I am not hopeful that immediate favourable consideration can be given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Leslie, n.e.section 6, and north half and S.W.5-12-28,\n\nSome time about October the 1st last year I secured from Mr Leslie a cash price on this land, and the same was sent to your office. At that time Mr Leslie gave an option on this land till 1 Dec., last, and this is just to tell you that you can have until the 1st of next December, but Mr Leslie would like to know what the prospects are of his farm being taken over by your department. I presume that you are aware that the S.E. quarter is now owned and operated by your department through the Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nMr Leslie has owned and operated the other three quarters of section 5 for years, and his farm is a bargain at the price quoted. The farm would undoubtedly go well along with the quarter you now operate on the same section.\n\nMr Leslie has now arranged to put his crop in this year but should you care to take it over new, or with crop that he puts in arrangements as to that can be made.\n\nI would be obliged if you would give me some idea as to what the prospects are of the Department taking this farm over. It would certainly work in well with what you now have, and the farm is in a very good state of cultivation, and there is lots of water and abundance of it, and there is also situate thereon a good house and barn, and the place is well fenced.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bell, Esq.,\nAssessor,\nElkhorn, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Grant for Hay Land at Elkhorn School.\n\nIn the list of requirements submitted by our Society last autumn to your Department for inclusion in your estimates for the current year, special mention was made of the need of hay and grazing land for the Elkhorn School. When the Deputy Superintendent General visited this School last year, his attention was directed to this urgent need, and he informed the Principal that he would endeavour to have it supplied. As our Commission are now facing the question of an adequate hay supply for this School for next winter, I shall be glad to know if the additional land is being provided.\n\nAs the haying season has arrived, and until the additional land has been provided, I shall be glad to know if your Department will authorize the rental of a section of hay land near the School, in order that the work of putting up hay may be begun at once. In a letter just received from the Principal he writes on this subject, in part, as follows:\n\n\"With reference to rental of Section 17 for hay land. During the past three years we have put up hay on different places on a two-third share basis. For instance, last year we put up and hauled home our hay a distance of 5 - 6 miles. In addition to the amount brought home we had to leave a large stack in the field as payment. This year we have very few large boys left in the School.\"\nand being also handicapped, as you know, by not having a sufficient number of horses, the hay proposition is going to be a difficult one.\"\n\nWith regard to Section 17 he states that it can be rented for the sum of $50.00 and as the hay land which the School had last year is not again available, he recommends the rental of this Section, and I shall be obliged if you will let me know at your earliest convenience if your Department will agree to this arrangement, and meet the rental charges.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, July 20, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the rental of Section 17 for hay land, in order to obtain an adequate hay supply for next winter's use at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. We note that this land can be rented for the sum of $50.\n\nWe are referring your request to Mr. Commissioner Graham, with the request that he take the action considered advisable relative to obtaining the Section referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 20, 1923,\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., relative to obtaining an adequate hay supply for next winter's use at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. I enclose herewith, for your information, an extract from Dr. Westgate's letter, from which you will observe that Section 17 can be rented for the sum of $50, and as the hay land which the school had last year is not again available, he recommends the rental of Section 17. I shall be pleased if you will enquire into this matter, and if you consider that it would be advisable to comply with Dr. Westgate's request, the Department will approve of your arranging for the rental, for the sum of $50, for the present season only, of the hay land mentioned. If you obtain this land, you may forward a voucher, in duplicate, when considered timely, for the amount due, which should not exceed the sum mentioned. We are informing Dr. Westgate that this matter is being referred to you.\n\nI may add that no decision has been reached with reference to the advisability of purchasing more land for this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nElkhorn, Man., March 3rd, 1927\n\nHon. Robt. Forke,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Lots 5 to 11 inc. in Block 2, and\nLots 1 to 8 inc. in Block 3\nVillage of Elkhorn -\n\nI am instructed by the Council of the Village of Elkhorn to ask your assistance in obtaining an adjustment of title to the above lots.\n\nThis property, the former site of the old Indian School buildings which were destroyed by fire, were sold by auction in 1914. Purchasers paid a small deposit at that time and were assessed the following year, and since, as owners. Unfortunately, no taxes have been or are being paid and as the Village is unable to obtain title through Tax Sale, on account of it being still Crown Land, arrears of taxes are fast accumulating and are shown each year in the Audit as an asset.\n\nThe position has already been brought to the attention of a Government Lands Inspector but without result.\n\nThe desire is that relief be obtained by action on the part of your Department to repossess these lots, or give title to the Village, thus allowing them to appear in the Assessment Roll as exempt.\n\nAny personal assistance you can extend the Council in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCharles W. Crosby, Clerk.\nW. DAVEY, Mayor\nC. W. CROSBY, Secretary-Treasurer\n\nELKHORN, Manitoba, September 12th 1928\n\nMinister of Crown Lands,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Lots 5 to 11 inc. in Block 2 and\nLots 1 to 8 inc. in Block 3\nVillage of Elkhorn\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter to Hon. Robt. Forke on March 3rd., 1927 - with the request that your Department will at once advise us in the matter.\n\nAll this property was sold for arrears of taxes in 1917 and application for title made - in error - the property being Crown Lands.\n\nThe lots are situate on Railway St. and are of no value for business or residential purpose. We are showing each year in the Audit as an asset, arrears of taxes on this property which we cannot collect, and the same applies to our Assessment Roll which gives an assessment total altogether misleading.\n\nIf your Department would either re-possess or give title to the Village, proper adjustment could at once be made and this land placed where it belongs, in the exemptions from taxation.\n\nAgain humbly soliciting your Department to take such action as will at once remedy this false situation in the financial records of the Village,\n\nYour Obt. servant\n\nCharles W. Crosby, Clerk\nOttawa, September 21, 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, addressed to the Minister of Crown Lands, Ottawa.\n\nWith regard to the several lots in Blocks 2 and 3 in the Village of Elkhorn, to which reference is made in your communication, I may say that the attached copy of a letter, dated March 14, 1927, addressed by the Honorable the Superintendent General to Honorable Robert Perke, M.P., Minister of Immigration & Colonization, will explain the attitude of this Department. These lots as well as others immediately adjoining were re-possessed by the Department in 1924, and have not since been re-sold. They should not, therefore, be carried on your assessment roll as subject to taxation.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary\n\nCharles W. Crosby, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nVillage of Elkhorn, Man.\nSir:\n\nThe question of additional hay lands for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School will have to receive immediate consideration by the Department. This school, as you are aware, has not sufficient land, and I do not know that the Department is prepared to buy land at the present time, but I have asked the Principal to locate a quarter section that could be leased. He now advises me that a quarter can be obtained for $50.00, from which they should be able to put up 100 tons. I do not think we should lose a minute in acquiring this land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nRev. F. Eley telephoned this office yesterday regarding a tennis court for the school. He has been trying to make a grass court but without success and he now wishes to make a shale one. A farmer living five miles from the school has a splendid shale court and he will let Mr. Eley have all the shale he requires without any charge. The only expense would be the hauling and it would probably take 12 loads at $2.00 a load.\n\nI would recommend that this expenditure be authorized as it would be a good thing for the pupils to have a tennis court at this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

E. F. Wilson, for the purposes of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, Lots 4 to 11, in Block 2, and Lots 1 to 8, in Block 3, Plan 2939, town of Birtle. (Abstract of Title entered under 314.) The purchase price was $1,548.64. This was the site of the first school which was burned in 1895. Before rebuilding, it was decided to secure a better site.\n\nOn October 6, 1898, an Order in Council set apart Sec. 35, T. 11, R. 29, W.P., for the purposes of the Indian Industrial School at Elkhorn. This section had been relinquished by the C. P. R. for this purpose - the consideration being other lands. It was in error that this section was set aside for the Indian School. It was acquired for a trade with Mr. Wilcox, who owned land which was suitable. P.C. 2914, of December 30, 1898, rescinded the earlier O.C. and set apart, under Sec. 31, of the Dominion Lands Act.\n\n(a) The S.W. \u00bc of Sec. 4, and the S.E. \u00bc of Sec. 5, T. 12, R. 28, W.P., excepting 4-1/5 a. in Sec. 4, which comprised the C. P. R. right of way.\n\n(b) Lots 1, 2 and 3, in Block H. and all of Blocks K. & L., in the town of Birtle.\n\nThe certificates of Title for the parcels in A. and the deed for the parcels in B. were forwarded to the Interior Department with our 116823 of October 31, 1898 (Interior Dept. File 178745). The parcels mentioned in A. had been owned by W. J. Wilcox, who was given a patent, by the Interior Department, to Section 35, which had been inadvertently set apart. The town lots mentioned in B., which are the actual site of the school buildings, were a free gift from the town of Birtle or the C. P. R., or both, on account of the location of the Indian School at Birtle. These town lots were deeded on July 7, 1897, to the Federal Crown and were included when the Department of the Interior set apart lands for the school. It later developed that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the trade with Wilcox, and a Mr. Cushing, who acted for him, having pointed this out, received a special payment of $506.50 in lieu of the fact that the original town lots, which were purchased from Wilson in 1891, were not deeded to his client.\n\nOrder in Council of May 5, 1904, approved of a trade between the C. P. R. and the Department, whereby the N.W. \u00bc of L.S. 14 of the N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 33, T. 11, R. 28, W.P. (20 acres) was given to the Department for the purposes of the Elkhorn School, for a consideration of $150, and for 4.26 acres in the S.W. \u00bc of Sec. 4, T.12, R.28, which was deeded to the C. P. R. as a gravel pit. A description of this gravel pit will be found on this file.\n\nIn 1901, it developed that the old town lots, the site of the original school, were not really required any longer. O.C. of April 23, 1906, authorized the Superintendent General to dispose of these lots. They were advertised for sale in January, 1913, and were sold by auction on April 21, 1917. The sale of Lot 1, Block 3, was cancelled and the land resumed by the Department, and on November 27th, 1924, the sale of Lots 2 to 8, Block 3, and Lots 5 to 11, Block 2, was cancelled and the land resumed by the Department. (The sale of Lot 4, Block 2,\nwas completed and the land patented to the purchaser in August 1921. (19675).\n\nOn October 22, 1919, the property of the Elkhorn Industrial School, excepting those lots in Blocks 2 and 3 (which the Department was trying to sell) was transferred by the Department of Indian Affairs to the Soldier Settlement Board by Order in Council. The property was as follows:\n\n(a) The school farm, containing 311.52 acres, comprising the south east quarter of Section 5, township 12, range 28, west of the 1st meridian (160 acres); and the south west quarter of section 4 of the said township 12, range 28, 160 acres less 4.20 acres for Canadian Pacific Railway right of way through the said southwest quarter of Section 4; and less 4.28 acres for gravel pit for Canadian Pacific Railway in the north-east corner of said south-west quarter of Section 4 described in Order in Council dated the 5th day of May, 1904, (151.52 acres);\n\n(b) Site of school buildings, containing 45.32 acres, being all of Blocks K and L (K containing 9.28 acres and L containing 32.04 acres), and Lots 1, 2 and 3 in block H (4 acres), in the town of Elkhorn; and -\n\n(c) Hay land, containing 20 acres, being north half of legal subdivision 14 of Section 33, township 11, range 28, west of the 1st meridian.\n\nP.

Earlier, it had been deeded to the Federal Crown and deed was forwarded to the Interior Department as for parcels 1 and 2. This parcel also was transferred to the S.S.B. and, by P.C. 1165, of April 7, 1921, returned to the Department of Indian Affairs for Indian school purposes.\n\n4. The N.\u00bd of L.S. 14 of the N.W.\u00bc of Sec.33, T.11, R.28, W.P., containing 20 acres more or less. This was granted to the Department for school purposes by O.C. of May 5, 1904. The consideration was $150 plus the gravel pit of 4.28 acres in the S.W.\u00bc of Sec.4, T.12, R.28.\n\nThis parcel is hay land and was also transferred to the S.S.B. and then, by P.C. 1165, of April 7, 1921, returned to Indian Affairs for Indian school purposes.\n\n5. Lots 5 to 11 in Block 2 and Lots 1 to 8 in Block 3, Plan 2339, town of EKHIWA, containing 1.55 acres more or less.\n\nThese lots were purchased in 1891 from E. F. Wilson for a consideration of $1548.64. Abstract of Title entered under No. 314. This was the site of the first school, which was burned in 1895. It may be advisable to sell these lots in the open market. An effort was made to do so from 1901 to 1917. The lots were all sold by authority of O.C. of April 23, 1906, but the sales were cancelled for non-payment and the land resumed by the Department. (The sale of one lot not included in the above, viz.: Lot 4 of Block 2, was completed and the land patented to the purchaser.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

In 1917, these lots were sold at auction but the sales were cancelled for nonpayment and the land resumed by the Department. I understand that these are not required for the purposes of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, and it is proposed to sell them, if suitable arrangements can be made. I write to enquire if these lots are at present vacant. You might look over the property and let me have a report.\n\nFor your information, I may say that these lots were the original site of the school buildings which were destroyed by fire in 1895.

The above land is under the old system of registration and a Crown grant cannot be registered under that system. Mr. Sterling can file the document and obtain certificate of title by paying the appropriate fee.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDistrict Registrar,\n\nECH/SMM.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 10, 1942.\n\nDear Colonel Pridham:\n\nThe writer is enclosing a copy of a letter forwarded by this office to your Deputy Registrar at Brandon and a reply thereto dated July 7th.\n\nI have not a copy of your Real Property Act before me but from memory I would doubt the soundness of the position taken by the Deputy Registrar at Brandon. It runs in my mind that there was an amendment to the Real Property Act back about 1936 or 1937 which provided for the filing or lodging of a Crown grant in a registry office subject to application by the grantee for a certificate of title which would issue as a matter of course on payment of a fee of three dollars.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise the writer on this point, and to that end we will hold the grant here before complying with instructions from your Brandon office to forward it direct to John L. Sterling the grantee.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\n\nColonel E.G.

Allan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Reserves and Trusts,\nDepartment of Mines and Natural Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch 106-0-9A\n\nDear Mr. Allan:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant enclosing letter of your Department dated 30th of June and copy of letter from the District Registrar at Brandon to your office dated July 7th.\n\nYour mind is evidently relating back to the time when you were connected with the Department of Mines and Natural Resources of this Province. The Real Property Act provides by Sec.28 thereof, for the issuance of a certificate of title upon the registration of a Patent issued by the Minister of Mines and Natural Resources of the Province of Manitoba, the Patentee paying a fee of $5.00 for the bringing of the land under the Act and the new certificate of title. This provision, however, relates solely to the Patents from our own Provincial Minister of Mines and Natural Resources.\n\nIt is suggested that you send the Crown Grant in question to the Grantee and let him attend to the application for title. There is apparently nothing on the Patent to indicate its value, therefore the District Registrar at Brandon was unable to give an estimate of the fees required for the service.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRegistrar General.\n\nEAP.\nOttawa, July 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAdverting to Departmental letter of June 30th last in which we advised you that Letters Patent had issued in your name covering Lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 Block 2, Elkhorn subdivision and were forwarded to the Registrar of Titles, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a letter from the District Registrar to the effect that it will be necessary for you to file the Grant with the Land Titles Office at Brandon, to obtain a certificate of title.\n\nThe Patent is attached hereto for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if I could have from you an expression of opinion in respect to the contemplated change of the highway, to which Mr. Alderwood refers. It has occurred to me that should it be decided to construct the highway through the school property that an opportunity would be given this Department to present its case.

No plan has been made for the location of the highway at this place and you can be assured that no steps will be taken in this regard unless the matter is laid before you for consideration.\n\nWe are also making a survey for a road on the north side of the track and there is a strong possibility that the road will be constructed on this latter location rather than on the south side of the track.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.A. Lyons,\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, February 13, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the road survey at Elkhorn.\n\nMr. Hoey wrote to the Deputy Minister, Department of Public Works, Winnipeg, and for your information I enclose a copy of his reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.

Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nOttawa, January 5th, 1946.\n\nW. Young, Esq., Indian Agent, GRISWOLD, Manitoba.\n\nWe are in receipt of an inquiry from C.C. Dahl, Elkhorn, Manitoba, regarding Lots 9, 10 and 11, Block 2 in the Village of Elkhorn.\n\nOn reviewing our records we find that the above lots were part of the old residential school, were declared surplus to the need of the new school, and were sold at auction in 1914 but the sales were cancelled for non-fulfilment of the conditions about 1921.\n\nThe lots are therefore open for sale but as the only valuation we have of the same was made prior to 1914, we have no idea as to what price should be asked for the lots at this time. I would therefore request that at your convenience you visit Elkhorn and ascertain what a proper price would be at this date. For your convenience I would advise that these three lots were each valued at $100.00 at the date of the auction sale.\n\nIt appears that we have various other lots in the town unsold and you might indicate whether there is any possibility of disposing of them at this time for our files indicate that they have earned no revenue for over twenty years.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeJ. Allan,\nSuperintendent, Reserves & Trusts.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe your letter File 116823-28 dated January 5th, 1946:\n\nI journeyed to Elkhorn yesterday and looked over the lots mentioned in your letter.\n\nElkhorn is a small village and these lots have 33 ft. frontage. Lots 9, 10, & 11, Block 2 are assessed for $495.00. The Municipal Clerk told me that their assessment was high, as lots have been selling in the village from $20.00 up. I do not feel that their value has increased any of late years. Lots in small towns in Manitoba are hard to sell. If a buyer wanted these lots badly enough he might pay $100.00 for them.\n\nThe other property owned by the Department are Lots 1 to 8 inclusive, Block 3. They are facing the railway and might be suitable for a warehouse. The Municipal Clerk advised me that he did not believe there was much chance of selling these lots at the present time.\n\nW. Young,\nIndian Agent.\nCalgary April 4/42\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn 1942 I completed payment on village lots in Elkhorn Manitoba purchased from Dept in 1937. My 1942 payment was $100.00 and I need a receipt for this as income tax Department won't allow it as deduction without receipt. I have written your dept. on two occasions asking for this but have had no reply to date. If you don't see fit to forward a duplicate receipt as requested I will be compelled to write the Auditor General as I do not intend to pay an extra hundred dollars in income tax.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.L.

Your letter of January 20, 1944, in which you made the same request, while received by the Department was not received in this office.\n\nOn reviewing your file it is noted that you made your payment to Inspector Hamilton who issued Receipt No. 33609. We have not a copy of this receipt here at Ottawa. However, we are attaching hereto a copy of our letter of April 16, 1942, in which we acknowledged the receipt of your payment.

G. Webster, Secretary Treasurer, Village of Elkhorn, Elkhorn, Manitoba, requesting the following information:\n\n\"Would you be able to advise if the Department of Indian Affairs would sell any or all of the following Village lots, and if so at what price.\n\nLots 9 - 10 - 11, block 2, plan 2939\n\nLots 1 to 8\n\nPlease advise.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\"\nR. S. Davis, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n338 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 25th, your file 299-6, with reference to unsold lots in the Village of Elkhorn.\n\nThe lots in question were part of the old residential school but were many years ago declared surplus to the needs of the school and some of them were sold at auction in 1914, the sales being subsequently cancelled for non-fulfilment of the conditions. The lots for which the village has enquired are open for sale and, according to the old appraisal on file, Lots 9, 10 and 11, Block 2, were valued at $100.00 each; Lots 1 and 2, Block 3, at $75.00 each; Lots 3 and 4, Block 3, at $60.00 each; Lot 5, Block 3, at $50.00, and Lot 6, 7 and 8, Block 3, at $40.00 each.\n\nIn 1946 we received an enquiry from a resident of the Village with reference to Lots 9, 10 and 11, Block 2, and at that time asked Indian Agent Young to visit the Village and look over the properties. He did so and I am enclosing herewith a copy of his letter of January 17th, 1946.\n\nIt appears rather obvious that we have little chance of selling the properties at the old appraisal and it is almost impossible to say what the proper value of the lots is at the present time. In fact it might be said that the true value is what we can get for them. Under the circumstances, while keeping in line with the original appraisals, I would suggest that you advise Mr. Webster or any interested party to make an offer for the lots. While we\ncertainly do not intend to sell the properties for a very low price, on the other hand we probably would be prepared to accept considerably less than the appraisal values above mentioned.\n\nD. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nThe Superintendent,\nIndian School Adm.,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Canon Cook;\n\nRe: Renting acreage\n\nI acknowledge your telegram of yesterday's date, and note that you have the authority to lease the land.\n\nThere are now three applicants for same:\n\nMr. Walter Miles of Elkhorn, a single man, who has farmed for several years in this district, would like to have the land and one of the cottages for one, or more years, he offers terms of one-third share of grain grown and one-third of hay he can put up. He has very good horses therefore would want barn space. I understand that he would make a good occupant. He wants to hear from you as to details of a lease.\n\nMr. Thomas O'Greysik would put in the breaking and summer-fallow on a one-third share. I understand he lives on a farm East of Town and farms a half of the Section adjoining our West quarter.\n\nMr. Frank O'Greysik phoned to Mr. R. S. Davis yesterday morning asking if he could rent the land with buildings and a cottage. At noon Mr. Davis phoned me to enquire what was happening here. He asked whether the land belonged to the Affairs Br. or to the Church, and said he would make enquiries. He told this man O'Greysik to come to see me. This he has done, and on the advise of Mr. Davis I wrote down O'Greysik's proposition, a copy of which I enclose. I have made enquiries regarding the O'Greysiks and reports are unfavourable; that this last mentioned would be undesirable about the School and buildings. He mentioned that the space of this farm yard would suit him for his machinery business, he is away much of his time in the Trucking Line.\n\nI have briefly outlined the leasing situation to you, and ask you to decide as to which of these men you will lease to.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. J. J. Woods,\nPrincipal\nRegarding the Rental of the land of the above School.\n\nMr. Frank O'Greysik, of Elkhorn, makes the following proposition.\n\nA three year term. Cash Rent of $250.00 per annum.\nWill keep the buildings in same state of repair as when his term commences. Will keep all fences on repair.\nWill keep the rough grass cut around the buildings.\nWould occupy one of the cottages, the smaller in preference and act as care-taker of the property.\n\nOR\n\nA rental on one-third share bases:\n\nThe same Mr. O'Greysik is willing to rent as follows:\nWill deliver one-third of grain to the Elevator for the Renter, and keep the buildings and fences in repair and be care-taker of the property, occupying one of the cottages at above mentioned.\n\nMr. Frank O'Greysik is a married man, with one child.

R. Turner.\n\nP.S.--Apart altogether from the matter of disposal of buildings by War Assets after the School is closed, it obviously would not be in the interest of the School to have lessees occupying school buildings or using school grounds for machinery, etc., yards during the School term. It is suggested, therefore, that any lease arranged be confined strictly to use of the farm land for cropping purposes.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nPlease find hereunder self-explanatory correspondence from General Turner concerning the leasing of the land at the Indian Residential School at Elkhorn. Originally it was intended to have one of these three applicants put in a crop and allow a share to the Department or to the Indian School Administration.\n\nI feel that a lease of this nature might unduly complicate the disposal of the school but am unaware naturally if there is any other complication in these requests.

School Farm - 311.52 acres consisting of SE\u00bc of 5-12-28 and SW\u00bc of 4-12-28 excepting from latter 4.28 acres to CPR for gravel pit given by P.C. of May 5, 1904.\n\n2.

Davis, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRe: Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your Army signal messages of April 28th and May 6th regarding the leasing of the farm lands formerly used by the Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nThe lands in question are public lands of the Dominion of Canada which by Order in Council were transferred to the former Department of Indian Affairs for the purposes of the Industrial School. Now that the School will be giving up the use of these lands on June 30th next, the question arises what use is to be made of the lands.\n\nIf the land is required for any Band of Indians we could seek authority to have the same set aside as a Reserve for such Band, but due to the location of the lands and their small area, it seems very unlikely that they would prove of much use to any group of Indians. Certainly, we could not justify setting apart the land as an Indian Reserve simply with the object of leasing it and crediting the revenue to the fund of any particular Band. However, if you had in mind establishing some Indians thereon, we would be prepared to consider any suggestion to that effect that you care to make.\nIf the land is not to be used for Indian Reserve purposes, then the normal course of action would be to declare the land surplus for residential school purposes and have our Minister transfer jurisdiction thereover to the Lands and Development Services Branch of this Department for such disposition as they may care to make of the same. If the land is so transferred, then it would be within the jurisdiction of the Lands and Development Services Branch to determine whether the land should be leased.\n\nMay we have a report from you regarding the establishment of the land as an Indian Reserve at an early date.\n\nLB/mh\n\nDirector.\n13 May, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nColonel F.

You should be able to see Canon Cook about this when he visits Elkhorn on June 1st. You can then decide the disposal of the furniture which is not required by the M.S.C.C. No doubt the desks, etc., can be shipped to other Indian day and residential schools.\n\nWith regard to the land, I am advising Mr. Allan that all the land owned by the school is not required for use as Indian reserves or otherwise and can be transferred to the Lands and Development Services Branch along with the buildings.\n\nI understand that the only building about which there is any doubt is the hen house. Canon Cook advises that the M.S.C.C. spent a considerable sum in adding to this hen house two years ago. It might possibly be to the advantage of all concerned to have this hen house turned over to the M.S.C.C. for sale locally, in return for their waiving an equity in this building.\n\nI have advised Mr. Allan also concerning the cemetery, and you will be receiving another letter from him concerning this. Is there a land surveyor in Elkhorn who could do this work immediately? If so, wire Mr. Allan to this effect.\n\n- The\nThe information contained in the body of this letter was prepared by Colonel Neary, who is, of course, in complete accord with the instructions indicated above. He informs me as well that there never was any idea of these buildings being handed over to the Knights of Columbus to be used as an Old Folks' Home.\n\nI am marking this letter \"Personal and Confidential\", as it is not really an official letter, and in any reply you may make to it which you wish to be considered official, it should not be mentioned.\n\nKindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of our Department of Industry and Commerce that the Indian Residential School in Elkhorn, Manitoba, has been closed, and that the buildings housing the school are to be disposed of by your Department. At the request of residents of Elkhorn, our Department of Industry and Commerce is endeavouring to locate manufacturers who may be interested in securing the use of these buildings.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch in Winnipeg informs me, however, that all heating and other equipment will be removed from the building at the end of June. It would appear that the buildings would be much better suited to manufacturing purposes if the present equipment were to remain installed. The Department of Industry and Commerce would be reluctant to take any further action with respect to locating other individuals interested in using the buildings unless it had some reasonable period of time in which to work.\n\nIt is possible that the efforts of this Department may result in either the sale or rent of the premises to some interested party. For this reason it would be of considerable assistance if removal of the equipment were to be delayed for some weeks.\n\nShould it be possible to delay action, I would be grateful if you would give some indication of the length of time which you could allow the Department in order that examination of the possible uses of the buildings and negotiations for their occupancy could be carried on. Departmental officials feel a minimum of five to six weeks would be necessary if this were possible without causing any inconvenience to your Department. I should\npoint out that our officials are not particularly optimistic with respect to the prospects of finding an industrial use for these particular buildings but are of the opinion that a reasonable effort should be made.\n\nI would appreciate any comments you would care to make regarding this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

In accordance with previous arrangements made between our respective branches as concerning disposal of former residential school lands, our Minister has signed an Order transferring the management, charge and direction of the said lands and buildings to your branch. I am enclosing herewith original of the said Order and a copy of P.C.1165 dated 7 April, 1921 whereby the said school lands, totalling 376.34 acres and described in Schedule \"A\" attached to the Minister's Order were transferred from the Soldier Settlement Board to the Department of Indian Affairs for purposes of the said school.\n\nIt is thought advisable to bring to your attention that during the operation of the school by the Anglican Church authorities, a cemetery was opened in the south west corner of the south west quarter of 4-12-23-W 1st M. In the beginning, we were somewhat concerned as regards the future care of this cemetery and discussed with the Anglican Church authorities.\nthe possibility of the local Anglican Church taking over the care and upkeep of the cemetery, and I am enclosing herewith correspondence on the subject. It was subsequently decided that as this was not Indian Reserve land, the cemetery was not in effect an Indian burial ground, but rather an Anglican Church cemetery, and it is not considered that this Branch is responsible in any way for the perpetual care of the cemetery.\n\nSince the closing of the school on June 30th we have had a caretaker in charge of the buildings. His employment by this Branch will cease on August 31st, and it is assumed that you will arrange to take charge of the buildings by that date.\n\nDirector.\n\nAll certificates & Title on Eldon School lands are recorded in Lands Development Services Branch.\n\n11/150.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCox Henry\n\nPlease note our memo of August 26th to Lands & Development Services Branch.\n\nThe final paragraph was added following conversation with Mr. Doucette.\n\n1/10/49\n\nLetter Davis\nCopy to Canon Cooks\nSeptember 2, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S.

Shaw, who is the farmer, and with whom I was co-operating, as to the purchase of the following cattle and pigs, as enumerated in your letter, number and date as given above:\n\nCattle.\n- 20 Cows, Holstein preferred,\n- 1 Bull\n\nPigs.\n- 1 Boar,\n- 2 Sows,\n\nI asked when he would like to have these delivered at the school. In reply he stated that he had no feed, for that reason he thought it best to defer delivery until there was a chance for them to graze. Further he named some time in July, not earlier than the middle of that month, as a suitable date for delivery. I deemed it wise to acquaint you with this fact.\n\nThis will afford time and enable the securing of good cows, a good bull can be secured much more readily, all with a clean health record.\n\nHolstein preferred will provide a good dairy herd. In this connection I have talked with Mr. W.W. Fraser, the Provincial Livestock Commissioner, to get his views on this important matter and he expressed his opinion that good grade Short Horns might be the more suitable strain, with a well bred Bull, Short Horn. He states that they will provide sufficient milk, and if anything goes wrong, the animal can be fattened and sold to better advantage than the Holstein. This suggestion I thought it well to mention to you. The cost would be less I am informed.\n\nI asked about the time that the farmer would like to have these delivered, and he has intimated in the fall, when he can readily provide feed for them. The farmer has specified that he would like to get \"Yorkshire\" strain. These can be procured locally.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWINNIPEG MAN 27\n\nTHE ASSISTANT DEPUTY AND SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nHAVE PURCHASED FOR ELKHORN TWENTY COWS AND ONE BULL WHICH HAVE\nBEEN DELIVERED PLEASE WIRE MY CREDIT BANK OF MONTREAL HERE\nNINETEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS TO PAY FOR SAME MAILING.\n\nVOUCHER TODAY\n\nJOHN R BUNN.\n\nThis is a collect message, and\nwill be charged to your account\nunless we are notified at once\nto the contrary.\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\nOttawa, October 29th., 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose cheque for $1940.00 and would ask you to kindly wire this amount to the credit of J.R.Bunn, with your branch at Winnipeg.\n\nI enclose blank telegraph form franked.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

Sims, a man of very wide and matured experience in his knowledge of cows.\n\nI was also careful to keep closely in touch with Mr. W.W. Fraser, the Provincial Livestock Commissioner of Manitoba, another man who is an expert about this cow business.\n\nAs a result I have been able to ship a very fine car of Durham or Short Horn Cows, milk strain, and a very fine young bull, also a Short Horn.\n\nI am satisfied that we have splendid value.\n\nThe Cows will all come shortly, one has already, the calf shown on the voucher being the result; it was a very fine calf. This means that inside of the next 3 or 4 months there will be 19 more calves added, if all goes well, and I feel that the animals will be well cared for and insure this success.\n\nI shall be submitting a report of my recent visit, early next week, I have been busy completing this cow business since my return, the cattle all arrived safely at Elkhorn at mid-day yesterday the 26th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, April 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letters of the 10th instant, relative to the re-opening of the Elkhorn Industrial School.

Am I to understand from this that the school has been led to believe that this number of horses will be supplied? My opinion is that ten work horses is more than is needed at a school of this kind. It is a question to me whether six or eight horses would not be sufficient, and I am going to decide on this when I next go to Elkhorn, which will not be very long.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 4, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 209-11A of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the purchase of draft horses for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. The Rev. Principal was informed on the 11th ultimo that you were being authorized to supply what horses you consider necessary. The principal in his request mentioned that six horses were required, but the Department will expect you to decide how many should be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, BSc\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nJ. H. Malloch,\nDeputy Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th inst. with reference to the purchase of draft horses for Elkhorn Residential School, stating you had written to the Principal informing him that I was being authorized to purchase what I considered necessary. In your letter of the 11th March, to me, you informed me that the Department has already purchased four work horses and one driver for this Institution, and that a further request for six additional horses was made. Is there not some mistake?\n\nMr. Inspector Murison was sent down to the Elkhorn School last week, to enquire into the situation there, and he tells me the only horses on the place are three draft horses\u2014 one team weighing between 2800 and 3000 pounds, and another odd horse, weighing between 1600 and 1700 pounds, which is not a mate for either of the other two, and is the wrong type of horse entirely for this school, in fact there is nothing to mate him. The three horses, in his opinion, are unsuitable for an Institution of this kind, being altogether too heavy; in which opinion, I quite concur. Horses weighing about 1300 or 2600 to a team, is what was needed here; these are known as general-purpose type of horses.\n\nIf you have not made a mistake in saying five horses have already been purchased, I would only have recommended the purchase of one more horse, and sell the big horse; but I feel there is some mistake. What I would suggest, and what I propose doing, is to sell the big horse; that is if we could find anyone to buy him, which I doubt very much, and buy four more horses, making six in all. If he has six work horses and one driver, this is all they require.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI understand there is only 130 acres at present under cultivation on the school property. This, no doubt, will be increased. Six horses will be ample to work this land, because he will always have two-thirds of the land in crop, which means one-third will have to be summerfallowed every year; and all that I feel like recommending at the present time is, as I said before, six work horses. It might be necessary to buy a driver at a cost of say $60 or $70. This will not be necessary, however, if a car is to be supplied.\n\nI am instructing Mr. Eley today to buy four horses\u20142 teams of horses\u2014at a cost of about $175 a team, and to sell the big horse, if he can get a reasonable price for it. I do not know what it cost. Mr. Eley has an Instructor at the School, who ought to be a fair judge of horses, so that he can confer with him before making the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 14, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 209-11A of the 9th instant, with reference to horses at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. I have examined the files and I find that the Department has already purchased four work horses for this school and that we authorized Mr. Inspector Bunn to purchase a driver. I have noted from your communication that there are only three horses at the institution. A driver has not been purchased and apparently one horse has either died or been lost.\n\nYour instructions to Mr. Eley to purchase four horses are approved. It might be well to authorize him to secure a driver as well, as the Department does not contemplate purchasing a car at the present time. Please inform Mr. Inspector Bunn of your action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

In your letter of October 27th, last, covering a voucher for the purchase price of the herd, you stated that you had secured the assistance of Mr. S. G. Sims and that you had kept in close touch with Mr. W. W. Fraser, the Provincial Live Stock Commissioner.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham has reported as follows: \"The most important thing on the list is $2000 for twenty cows and a bull - $100 for each animal. Mr. Murison tells me the cows are the ordinary grade short-horns and could have been bought for $40 a head, and I believe he is right. A saving here of $1200 could have been effected.\"\n\nI am particularly desirous of learning who is responsible for the decision concerning the type and grade of cows selected and who made the actual selection of the individual animals. I have examined the voucher and I note that the purchase price of the milch cows was $65 each. Please inform me also concerning Mr. S. G. Sims, who received payment for the stock and who apparently assisted you in the purchase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, 28th May, 1924.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have your letter, number and date as given above.\n\nI have been so fully engaged in purchasing certain supplies and materials as per instructions of the Department, dated the 14th May, 1924, Letter # 123-1-5B, that I have not been able to submit a reply to your letter of the 17th, and No., as quoted above.\n\nI know that I can meet the allegations made, and submit explanations that will be satisfactory I think.\n\nI wish to get the orders for the materials I have referred to all placed, and these moving, as the season will be shorter than usual on account of its lateness. When this is done I will address myself to this letter of 17th May, 1924.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWinnipeg, 30th May, 1924.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI beg now to submit the reply that I promised in my acknowledgement of your letter, number and date given above.\n\nOn the day I received this I also received instructions about certain shipments of materials for the addition that is being made to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I had to hustle these shipments to catch the first steamer of the season leaving Selkirk for the north.\n\nI will now submit the facts about the purchase of the Cows and a Bull for Elkhorn Indian Residential School by me in October 1923.\n\nIn the letter of the 22nd March, 1923, from the Department, I was told to secure the advice of the Superintendent of the Experimental Farm at Brandon. I went to Elkhorn on or about the 4th April 1923, and my report of the 10th April, 1923 shows what I did. After I had finished the purchase of the Horses, Seed Grain, Feed Oats and Implements &c., I told Mr. G.M. Shaw, the farmer who was at Elkhorn then, that I was instructed to buy 20 Cows for the School, and 1 Bull, tyre Holstein preferred. I wanted an expression of opinion from him; he was candid and stated that he thought the Short Horn milk strain was the type that would best suit the service of the School. I noted this opinion; this animal he stated would be the best type to use for instructing Indian pupils in the care of cattle, which is an important matter in the training and educating of the Indian boys. I then returned to Winnipeg.\n\nI may say that I was at this time endeavoring to determine what would be the best type of animal. I called on Mr. W.W. Fraser, the Provincial Livestock Commissioner, and\nI told him just what I was after, he introduced me to Mr. S. G. Sims, who at the time was officially connected with Mr. W. W. Fraser, this was the first time I had met the gentleman. Mr. Fraser readily and willingly went into the whole matter with me, after talking in a general way about Cows, he told me that in his opinion that a good grade Short Horn milk strain would probably be the best and most suitable type of animal to pick out. Mr. Fraser called Mr. Sims in to the talk, Mr. Sims' desk being right alongside Mr. Fraser's. I was sitting between them. Mr. Sims was associated with Mr. Fraser in handling the Cow Scheme of the Provincial Government, and had been doing this for some years, so that he was intimately in touch with conditions relating to such business. Mr. Sims corroborated Mr. Fraser's opinion as to the type. You will note that I was talking to men of experience with reference to this Cow matter, and I feel certain that these opinions, of these men, must be respected. In our discussions, I was also particular to make clear the matter of cost, and that I wanted to get the best service for the smallest cost, which was in line with my instructions.\n\nOn the 10th April, 1923, I submitted a report about this Cow and Bull business, and I make reference to my interview with Mr. Fraser, the Provincial Livestock Commissioner. On the 25th I received a reply to my report of the 10th inst., under date the 23rd. In this reply I am told to continue my negotiations with Mr. Fraser, and in conjunction with him and Dr. Westgate, of the M.S.C.C., to make arrangements for 20 Cows that would be most suitable. This programme was followed out, I met Mr. Fraser several times. I also met the Rev'd F. Eley, who is now the Principal, at that time he was acting, and he talked with Dr. Westgate I believe, and made other inquiries, which impressed as to the qualities of the Short Horn, of the milk strain. Later I met Mr. Sims again and he reiterated his opinion about the type. I asked him about cost and he said this would run from $75.00 to $100.00 to get good cows in good condition and showing good milk conformation, and at that price I would get animals all in calf and due to freshen very soon. After this I again met Mr. Fraser, the result was that I decided that I would be wise to do business with Mr. Sims, who was now free from the Provincial Government, and in doing so I deemed it was wise to be guided by the opinion of these men who were experienced and had good judgement in this kind of business.\n\nThen Mr. Sims picked up good cows from different farmers, in good condition and in the shape, as to calving &c., that I have mentioned above. In due course he secured the 20 cows, in about 9 or 10 weeks. He assembled them at Stowall.\n\nAt the time arranged, Mr. Fraser was good enough to come with me to examine the animals, after making a thorough examination he expressed the opinion that I had a splendid bunch.\nbunch of Cows, and good value for the money to be paid for them, he also stated that this bunch was as good as he had seen for a long time, and could and would be the basis of making an A1 herd, if they were cared for and handled right, and that he had no doubt as to the service they would give, being satisfactory in every way. This opinion from such a man made me feel that I had procured the best type of animal that I could desire for Elkhorn School.\n\nThe Cows were shipped forthwith and arrived safely in due course at Elkhorn. Rev'd. F. Eley writing to me on the 27th October, 1923, makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am personally highly delighted with them (the cows) and agree with you that we have a fine herd.\"\n\nWith the 20 Cows I shipped a fine young Bull, Short Horn, milk strain, he has his papers, and comes of good stock. He cost $25.00, and is considered to be a fine fellow.\n\nSince these cows arrived at Elkhorn we have added a very fine crop of calves, 19 calves are living, and 1 was born dead, from injuries in transit I understand. These calves are classed as very good, several of them being excellent I am informed. This shows that we had procured good cows of assured motherhood.\n\nI might also state here that Mr. Sims told me that he could get me cows at from $22 to $50.00, but he said that he would not advise purchasing animals.\n\nI have also several opinions as to the cows I bought, one from a pretty large dealer, and he told me, and he did not know what I paid, that the cows I had were worth from $70.00 to 90.00 each, and that they could not be bought for a cent less. The cows I purchased cost $85.00 on an average.\n\nI have made inquiry as to the cost of such animals, as I got today, and I am informed that you could not get them in the same condition in every way, for less than from $65.00 to $85.\n\nMr. Eley, the principal, informs me that Dr. Westgate recently visited Elkhorn, that he has seen the cows and the calves, and has expressed himself to the effect that he was much pleased with the whole outfit.\n\nThe farmer at Elkhorn is a graduate of Guelph Agricultural College, and his opinion is that we have a fine bunch that are very suitable for the service of the School.\n\nI may also state that I inquired about Holstein, but I was not encouraged about them and felt that it would be a risky and doubtful matter to get such type, and the cost was, for good stuff, a higher cost, cheap Holstein is very doubtful stuff to deal in I am informed.\n\nSince I received your letter, to which this is a reply, I have called up Mr. Fraser, and he has reiterated the opinion that he expressed when he and I went to Stonewall to examine the cows I bought before shipment. He also stated that these cows\ncows were worth every cent that they cost, and that for similar animals the cost could not be bettered today. I have faith in this man's knowledge of this business, not because it favors my action, but because I believe that he knows what he is talking about. He is a straight man who is not afraid to state his opinion fairly and clearly, and his opinion is not any hearsay when he speaks in connection with cows or bulls; he speaks from experience and his practical knowledge about such matters.\n\nI hope I have clearly and fully answered your letter. I exercised every care to get a type of animal that was satisfactory to the service to be served. I also exercised care that I would not pay more than what such an animal was worth, and I feel that my action is confirmed by men of experience who know all the facts and the animals I bought; there is no hearsay at all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 7, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your No. 209-11A of the 6th ultimo relative to the stock that was purchased for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. Mr. Inspector Bunn has made a special report, at my request, and I wish to draw to your attention that the purchase price of the milk cows was $85 each, not \"$100 for each animal.\"\n\nI wish to quote from the Inspector's letter: \"I met Mr. Fraser (the Provincial Live Stock Commissioner) several times. I also met the Rev. F. Eley, who is now the principal - at that time he was acting - and he talked with Dr. Westgate, I believe, and made other inquiries which impressed him as to the qualities of the Short Horn, of the milk strain.

As, naturally, the original cheque is not endorsed by Mr. Sims, and the voucher does not bear his receipt, this office has no evidence that this money actually reached him.

The Auditor General has drawn attention to this payment, and has pointed out that as the cheque is not endorsed by Mr Sims, to whom payment was due, and in whose favour the voucher was made out, without being receipted by him, it is necessary to furnish evidence that the money actually reached him.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I have to request that you will be good enough to obtain a receipt from Mr Sims to the amount above stated and forward it to the Department for transmission to the Auditor General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.D.

Bunnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChamber of Commerce,\nPrincess Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., June 30, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nElkhorn Industrial School.\n\nAnother matter where I found an absolute waste and unwarranted expenditure was in the purchase of the milk cows for this institution. We have got 20 very ordinary shorthorns, ranging in age from four to ten years. These cows are only giving a quantity of milk today that one would expect to get from about eight cows, I think the average is about 3\u00bd quarts per cow per day, and this quantity will reduce to about half this amount in a month's time, so you can see the position we are in regard to this matter. The cows can be replaced today for $30.00 each. Bad judgement was also shown there in the purchase of horses, and three prices were paid for them.\n\nIt is a serious matter that this mistake was made regarding the cows, because we are feeding today, 20 cows where perhaps 12 properly selected animals would supply the necessary milk that is required. The hay and feed problem here is a serious one, and I believe at the present time we have got more animals around the place than we can possibly find feed for. Dr. Westgate was up there the other day asking me to provide fencing for a small hay slough that is there. I examined the slough and there is no hay there, it is growing this wire grass which animals will not eat; they might get a couple of loads of hay off it but this would not warrant making a fence.\n\nLong before the purchase of these cows I wrote to the Department, and also spoke to Inspector Bunn, who was instructed to deal with the whole problem, with regard to the importance of buying suitable cows for this institution in view of the fact that the number would have to be limited on account of the shortage of feed.\n\nThere has been a serious blunder made in connection with the re-establishing of this institution and it is starting out under a heavy handicap for which, in my opinion, there is no excuse.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJuly 4th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nRe Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 30th ultimo in which you deal with the purchase of cows, I wish to refer you to my letter of the 7th ultimo from which it would appear that Mr. Bunn took reasonable precaution to insure the purchase of satisfactory stock.

Sims for Live Stock purchased for Elkhorn School.\n\nAt the request of Mr. Sims after the cattle had been shipped and the question of paying for them was discussed by him and me, I asked for his account, which was $1940.00. I wired the Department to telegraph this amount to my credit at the Bank of Montreal in Winnipeg; the bank advised me that this amount was there, in due course. I then had a cheque drawn for this amount drawn and certified and accepted this cheque I mailed to Mr. Sims c/o Bank of Hamilton, Stonewall, by registered mail, the Bank of Hamilton was Mr. Sims' bank.\n\nTo confirm the above statement I am enclosing a letter from the Manager of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, with which the Bank of Hamilton has amalgamated.\n\nI am also enclosing the cheque above referred to, which bears the signature of Mr. S.G. Sims; this will show that the money has reached Mr. Sims all right. I have asked Mr. Sims for receipt when this comes to hand. I will forward same. I thought I would get all the above information and submit it.\n\nIf possible please return the cancelled cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-14, part 1)\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th of July, in which you refer me to your letter of the 7th of June. In reply would say that your letter of the 7th of June did not reach this office until the 2nd of July, and I, naturally, did not have it before me when I wrote you on the 30th of June or I certainly would have referred to it.\n\nI have read your letter of the 7th of June very carefully, and it has not altered my opinion in the very slightest degree regarding the stock at Elkhorn. I have confidence in Mr. Murison's judgement; I have some confidence in my own judgement, and I am quite satisfied that what has been reported to you would be borne out by any reliable stockman. You knew well before you gave the commission to Mr. Bunn to purchase this stock that he was not competent to do the work. The Department were called upon to buy a team of horses for Fisher River, and this purchase was entrusted to Mr. Bunn, and the horses supplied were absolutely unsuitable, one being a heavy horse, almost a Clyde, and the other a pony. He certainly got the worst of that deal, and bought something that should not have been bought.\n\nHe was instructed, at the time he bought this horned stock, to buy horses for the school, and we almost got a team of curiosities there; a horse weighing 1800 lbs. and a mate which died, I am told.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6263, file 578-14, part 1)\nWhy, if a man knew the first thing about stock, would he go and have a deal of this kind put over?\n\nIs it not convincing enough to you when I tell you that during the month of May 16 cows produced only 496 gallons of milk, and that we did not get the quality of cows which your letter of the 7th of June would indicate we did. There is no sense, to my mind, in carrying on a controversy of this kind. If you want this matter investigated I will only be too glad to stand by what I have said and have a thorough stockman go in and make a report.\n\nMy advice to the Department is to let this matter stand, and I am merely pointing this out so that there will not be a recurrence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJuly 28, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the stock purchased for the Elkhorn Industrial School. My only purpose in writing further on this subject was to assure you that as far as we were concerned we had instructed Mr. Bunn to take experienced advice on these purchases, as we were not willing to leave the matter to him. However, we will consider the matter closed, and if at any time you can make some better arrangement for the milk and stock for this school I should be glad if you would do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M.

She had beenailing for three days and the local Veterinary Surgeon could not relieve her. A post-mortem revealed an abscess in her right lung. The Doctor is of the opinion that it was not a tubercular condition, but to make certain a smear was sent to Winnipeg for analysis and we will no doubt have the definite cause in a few days.\n\nAt present eight cows have freshened, and although our feed is of a very good quality, we are not getting a nearly sufficient quantity of milk to meet our requirements. The steer calves are being butchered as we can not afford the milk to do them justice, and the heifer calves we are endeavouring to raise in order to improve our herd. I would like your advice in this matter - shall we continue in this regard, or shall we butcher the whole which would allow considerably more for the school.\n\nThere is one four year old heifer in this herd, that had difficult parturition last year with her first calf. It resulted in a prolonged illness which naturally dried her up at once. This year she has proven sterile, and as she is consuming food feed for which we are getting no returns, are we justified in keeping her. The local Doctor has confirmed my opinion as to her sterility.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Rev. Fred Bley.\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nPrincipal. Per E.G.M.\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter dated the 12th inst. that I received from the Rev. Fred Eley, Principal of the Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nYou will notice that he is not satisfied with the quantity of milk he is getting from the cows that were purchased when this school was opened two years ago.\n\nMy contention, as you know, was that we should never have bought this type of animal, and had we bought Holsteins, which is the type of animal used at almost every public institution, we would have had no trouble.\n\nThe object of Mr. Eley's letter is to ascertain what assistance can be given to them with regard to this matter and I would be glad to know if the Department are prepared to do anything further for this school.\n\nI have advised Mr. Eley to butcher the four-year-old cow mentioned in the last paragraph of his letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to report that the health of your cattle is not satisfactory. Premature births and abortions have become the rule rather than the exception. This condition has materially reduced this year's crop of calves, also the flow of milk has been much lessened. You are consuming milk from diseased animals, which practice, if not actually dangerous, is certainly not to be recommended. I would also point out that your herd has not been subjected to the Tuberculin Test. This constitutes a real menace to the health of the School inmates. I may say I find the feeding arrangements and sanitation satisfactory.\n\nI would recommend the disposal of your entire stock, and the thorough disinfection of barns as certainly the most satisfactory method of eradicating contagious abortion.\n\nIn my opinion you should be provided with a herd of straight dairy cattle, Holsteins preferred, since it is milk production you require, beef being only of minor importance.\n\nThe cost of such a change would not be prohibitive, since the present herd would bring a fair price on the public market.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) J.H. Hennan, V.S.\n\nRev. F. Eley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian School, Elkhorn, Man.\nI beg to inform you that I have received from the Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Industrial School a copy of a report from the Veterinary Surgeon of the town of Elkhorn, giving the result of an examination that he has made of the cattle at the School, which report is enclosed herewith.\n\nThis report speaks for itself. A serious mistake was made in buying these cattle in the first place. You will note that the Veterinary Surgeon now recommends that the school be supplied with a herd of cattle of the description recommended by me, long before the present herd of very inferior cattle were purchased by the Department.\n\nI do not wish to make any recommendation at all with regard to this matter. I knew a serious mistake was being made at the time, and said so on two occasions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

FIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.S.\nMarch 2, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nIt is the Department's practice to replace milch cows at Indian residential schools when they are destroyed by order of the Veterinary General. Such destroyed animals are sometimes sold for beef. The question to be decided is whether the proceeds from the sale should be applied on the replacement of the animals or should be deposited to Casual Revenue.\n\nI consider that the school management has some general equity in the stock at these institutions and that the proceeds could quite properly be considered school moneys. I therefore recommend that they be held to be applied on replacement costs and not forwarded to Ottawa for deposit. This would relieve the Appropriation for Indian Education somewhat.\n\nRussell T.

Some funds are available for the purpose and I should be grateful if you would let me have a recommendation as to what should be supplied, listing the machinery in order of importance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, No. 106-0-14, saying that it has been represented that certain agricultural implements are required for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. This is rather a surprise to me, as I am under the impression that this school is probably better equipped in the way of machinery than any school we have and the Department have been particularly generous to this institution.\n\nYou ask me to give a list of the machinery in order of importance. I may say that I cannot see that any machinery is necessary. As a matter of fact, after I received your letter I called up the Principal and asked him what was required in the way of machinery. He stated that the only thing he knew of was a plow and I am of the opinion that this is not necessary. There is less than 200 acres under cultivation at this school, which means that they should have 150 acres in crop each year. During the summer months they are called upon to summerfallow perhaps 50 acres, and this would be about 10 days work for the gang plow, which they have on hand. The Principal, when he mentioned the fact that he might want a plow, said he would not require it this year, so we have it from the Principal that he only requires a plow. I may state for your information that the following implements are on hand at this school:\n\n1 Seeder\n1 Wagon\n1 Truck\n1 Manure Spreader\n1 Binder\n1 Mower\n1 Rake\n1 Corn Cultivator\n1 Field Cultivator\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\n1 Potato Planter\n1 Potato Planter\n1 Drag Harrow\n1 Disc Harrow\n1 Feed Cutter\n1 Fanning Mill\n1 Gang Plow\n   Several sets of new harness\n1 Harrow Cart\n2 sets Bobs\n1 Grain Crusher\n1 Jumper\n\nIf the Department can think of any other thing that a small farm should have in the way of implements, it is more than I can do. This institution is well equipped and the party who made the suggestion that certain implements are required was not familiar with conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 13, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 8th instant, with reference to agricultural implements at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.

The church authorities had refused to buy the school another team and, as a consequence, there were not sufficient horses to carry on the work. It was therefore decided to buy two more.\n\nAs I have better facilities here for making a purchase of this kind and am able to buy animals cheaper than at Elkhorn, I purchased a very fine team of well matched bay mares, aged 5 and 6, which had been raised on a farm just North of Regina and are well broken and after a while they should weigh 1500 lbs. each.

He has taken up the question of repairing the old separator with the Massey-Harris Agent in Elkhorn who advised him that it would be cheaper to purchase a new one as the old machine has been in constant use since 1923. The local Agent offered to take the old machine on a trade and supply a new one for a cash payment of $70.00.

Hamilton,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCommercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor the past two years I have mentioned in my farm requirements as reported in my annual returns the need for wagons.\n\nWith every indication of a crop this year, this need is the more accentuated. We have over 300 acres of oats and barley coming up and I am wondering how we shall handle the harvesting with our equipment.\n\nWe seriously need two wagons and the binder we have is 17 years old. A new binder would ensure the getting in of our crop.\n\nAs you are aware, we have rented a farm of three quarter sections in the vicinity in the hope of making the school more self-supporting but this of course makes the need of equipment more urgent.\n\nWith the failure of past years on the farm we have naturally not urged such needs. With the signs of a heavy crop this year in this district it will be next to impossible to borrow a binder or wagons at the time we shall want them.\n\nIf you can do anything to supply these needs I should be greatly relieved.\n\nThe Commission has already authorized me to buy two granaries to care for the expected bountiful situation.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) S. J. Wickens\n(Principal)\nWINNIPEG, MAN., July 18th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Rev. Canon Wickens, Principal of the Anglican Indian Residential School, Elkhorn, Man.\n\nI have no doubt that the binder and two wagons requested are needed, especially the wagons. I understand there is one wagon now in use which is the property of the school and that, during the past eight or ten years, extra wagons have been provided by the present farming instructor. However, there is a possibility of him leaving the school, which makes it imperative that other wagons be provided.\n\nI think if the Department could supply the two wagons complete with box, Canon Wickens should be able to provide the binder, especially if the crop turns out as well as he anticipates. If funds can be provided, I would recommend that the above suggestion be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 25, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11A C.E. of the 15th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, in which he requests that two wagons and a binder be purchased, for use on the school farm.\n\nIn this connection might I state that the following amounts are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year:\n\nElectric refrigerator for the dairy - $800.\nPainting and general repairs - $500.\n\nNo funds were provided to purchase farm equipment. If, after you discuss the matter with the Principal, it is considered that the two farm wagons are more urgent than expending the funds provided for painting and repairs, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of two wagons, from a firm on the approved list. If the purchase is made, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the providing of cold storage equipment and any minor repairs and painting, I would request that you inform the Department of the approximate cost of the cold storage equipment, where same could be installed and also that you will state in detail the minor repairs and painting that could be carried out for the balance of the appropriation after the purchase of the wagons.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of a binder, the Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure required, as it is considered that the school authorities should be able to purchase this equipment, especially if the crop turns out as well as anticipated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If necessary, you may expend further amount not exceeding one hundred dollars, purchase paint for outbuildings.\"\n\nIt is noted you have purchased two wagons and boxes, at a cost of $285.70; that you recommend the jacket heater be repaired, at a cost of approximately $75.00, and the machine shed doors rehung at a cost of approximately $65.00. The Department notes, further, your recommendation that the balance - approximately $100.00 - be used in the purchase of paint for the outside buildings. It is thought that, possibly, this will not be sufficient to purchase the quantity of paint required, and, as advised in telegram above referred to if necessary, you may incur a further expense of $100.00 in excess of the $600.00 which you were informed was available, in the purchase of paint.\n\nIt is understood that the staff of the school will perform the labour in connection with the painting, without expense to the Department.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, covering all expenditures, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nWhen you have full information regarding the cold storage equipment, the Department will be pleased to receive particulars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Clifford Sifton,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir,\n\nOur catholic Indians and Half-breeds of Fort Alexander wish me to call your benevolent and serious attention to the following facts:\n\n1o. They have now 41 children below twelve (12), that they would send now or later on to a local Boarding School;\n\n2o. Only fifteen children attend the actual Day-School and the results of this school have proved to be almost null or hardly satisfactory.\n\n3o. The reason why so few children attend the Day-School are the following: (a) Long distance. Some are five miles away from the school. (b) The difficulty of crossing the River Winnipeg. (c) The poverty of the parents.\n\n4o. The parents are quite willing to send their older children to the Industrial School of St. Boniface, and, in fact, there are some now boarding in this school; but they would like to retain near them the younger ones.\n\n5o. They were the first ones to petition for a Boarding School and they started over two years ago.\n\n6o. At a meeting of the interested parties held the 12th of February ult., resolutions were passed re the future Boarding school and a new petition bearing 26 names has been sent to the Hon. David Laird at Winnipeg. The petitioners were the following:\n\n| Name               | Number |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Baptiste Guimont   | 1      |\n| Baptiste Morisseau | 3      |\n| Louison Guimond    | 1      |\n| Augustin Fontaine  | 1      |\n| Louis Courchene    | 2      |\n| Xavier Courchene   | 1      |\n| Elz\u00e9ar Canada      | 2      |\n| Louison Bruy\u00e8re    | 1      |\n| Charles Fontaine   | 2      |\n| Pierre Guimond     | 1      |\n| Jo Morisseau       | 1      |\n| Jo Bruy\u00e8re         | 2      |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Under the arrangement with the Oblate community the site of the Fort Alexander Boarding School is to be conveyed to the Crown. That being so, I see no objection to the request being complied with on condition that the building is placed on a portion of the property to be conveyed, for it will remain our property and will be of advantage in the educational work of the School.

(RG 10, Volume 6264, file 579-1, part 1)\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup-Gen. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nI have just received a letter from Rev. Father Wales of Fort Alexander Manitoba. In it he mentions that the amount authorized for forty-five children does not give everybody satisfaction. He says that he has been obliged to refuse children being admitted and there is great discontent among the parents, because he is unable to take the children in his school. He informs me that they are two-thousand dollars in debt now and there are three persons who receive no salary. From our experience of the Boarding and Industrial Schools we know that an allowance of seventy-five dollars for the Government Schools is very low.\n\nNow if we could as the Father suggested give them the privilege of taking in sixty children they might be able then to make ends meet. The staff would be just the same for sixty as for forty-five.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, May 1, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application made by Mr. Jackson, M.P., for an additional grant to the Fort Alexander Boarding School, I beg to say that this matter was dealt with on No. 6 of this file.\n\nMr. Inspector Semmens recommended increasing the number provided for from 45 to 55 and used the same arguments in favour of the increase that are made by Mr. Jackson. In my memorandum on Mr. Semmens's report I stated that I did not think that the Department should at this early date, the school only being opened on June 1, last, provide for any increased grant, and that the Commissioner was of the same opinion.\n\nOn the margin of my memorandum you wrote the word, \"No\", and the Commissioner was, on the 13th of March, last, advised that the Department was not in favour of increasing the grant to this school at the present time.\n\nThere is no money provided to meet an increased number of pupils and I think they should be held to the arrangement made with the Oblat Fathers when the exchange of the St. Boniface Industrial School was entered into for at least another year.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6264, file 579-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 15, 1906.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th ult., applying on behalf of the Principal of the Fort Alexander Boarding School for authority to increase the number of pupils at that institution from forty-five to fifty-five, I regret to say that the Department cannot at present see its way to meet your wishes in this matter.\n\nThis school has been opened less than a year and under the arrangement with the Oblat Fathers forty-five pupils was the limit agreed upon. There is no provision in the estimates to meet the cost of an increased number of pupils, and the Department considers that it should continue under the present arrangement for at least another year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Supt.

Jackson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 22nd, 1907.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWill you please note for the Supplementary Estimates an increase in the pupilage at the Fort Alexander School from 45 to 60 pupils.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nFort Alexander, Man.\nJanuary 29th 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to ask the Department to grant me a sum sufficient to enable me to pay for the necessary outbuildings that I have been compelled to erect at the Fort Alexander Boarding School. I was obliged to build a store house 43 x 30. This building was very necessary. Under the building I built a basement, full size, where we keep our vegetables for winter. On the first floor is stored other material. Our carpenter shop is in the same building. This building cost $600.00. This is a low price, but the material from the old building was used in the construction.\n\nI built a stable 66 x 22 ft. It is necessary, placed as our school is, so far from civilised conditions for us to keep horses, cows and chickens. In this building is kept the stock. The cost of erecting it was $1000.00, there being used 20,000 feet of lumber.\n\nI have built a cesspool &c., also iron casing on steps of fire escape, and alterations that cost about $150.00 in the laundry and changing size of school rooms.\n\nI have had built a barn 44 x 26 costing $600.00. The building is used to store grain, hay and other fodder.\n\nI have also built a piggery 66 x 32 costing $500.00.\nWe use part of this building to keep our vehicles and implements in, and a portion is left open for stock to run under in stormy weather while out.\n\nThe total cost of these buildings as valued by Inspector Semmens is at least $3820.00. As my deficit is enormous I am compelled to ask the Department to relieve me of a portion of my liabilities which have all been incurred in erecting these necessary buildings. Anyone who has had experience in opening of a new institution and erecting all the buildings and placing everything in working order can appreciate the difficulty I have had, and how impossible it is for me to make an estimate of first cost. The cost of transportation of material has been a heavy item of expense. Waiting at times for material and skilled labor under heavy expense of wages lying idle contributes to increased cost and cannot be placed in an estimate.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Mr Jackson,\n\nSir,\n\nFather Valis has a balance against the Boarding School at Fort Alexander of $3506.29\n\nAgainst this he has constructed buildings which have not been authorized but which were necessary to the effective working of the School as follows:\n\n- Old School Repaired and enlarged: $600.00\n- New Barn and Cow Shed 66 x 22: $1000.00\n- New Piggery and Implement Shed: $600.00\n- New Barn for Hay and Straw: $600.00\n\nTotal: $2800.00\n\nIf in any way the Father could be remunerated for all this as it stands on School Property it would be appreciated.\n\nThe Bank is pressing him and he is at his wits end.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nJohn Summers\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nS: J: Jackson Esq M.P.\nOttawa\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nD.

Father Vales, Principal Fort Alexander Indian Boarding School. It is my desire to see some assistance granted to Father Vales. He is a very fine man, has a good school, and is a personal friend of mine and anything you can do for him would be considered a personal favor by myself. Father Postmes of Winnipeg was here the other day and called on me and I expect he will likely call on me in a few days and when he does I will take him over to see you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Valles, asking for assistance for the Fort Alexander boarding school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a number of applications have come in through the Rev. Father Poitras, of Winnipeg, including this school, and they are at present all under consideration here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nTo the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe extra buildings for the Indian Boarding School at Fort Alexander, Manitoba\u2014\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that Rev. Father Vales, Principal, has been in the necessity of constructing extra buildings for his school at a cost of $2,500.00 It is the valuation put on by Mr. Semmens, Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nTherefore I ask that a sum of $2,500.00 be put in the estimates to cover that expenditure.\n\nI might add that this school had a deficit of $3,506.29 at the beginning of 1907, as certified by Mr. Semmens. This is due to the extra cost of freight, materials and labour in that district.\n\nTherefore I hereby make application to have the capitation raised from $72 to $100 for this school, as well as for all the others.\n\nIt is a fact admitted by all, Inspectors, Agents, even by the Commissioner himself, that the work of the schools cannot be properly carried on with the scanty capitation now granted.\n\nHoping that my requests will be granted,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nExtra Buildings\n\n1\u00b0 a Shed 66x22\n2\u00b0 a Horse & cattle stable\n3\u00b0 a Henney 66x22\n4\u00b0 a Barn 144x26\nOttawa, February 21st., 1908.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th of January asking for certain financial assistance to the Boarding School at Fort Alexander. As you are aware this school was erected, together with the schools at Fort Frances and Sandy Bay, in lieu of the St. Boniface Industrial School, and the transfer of the property was regulated by Order-in-Council of February 8th 1904. If the Department had maintained the St. Boniface Industrial School no increased capital expenditure would have taken place; and it would seem advisable to keep the Boarding Schools upon the scale at which they were taken over.\n\nThe buildings for which assistance is requested were built before the fact of their necessity was represented to the Department and no authority was given for the expenditure. This is not the usual course and in the absence of any funds specially voted for these additions it is difficult to see how they could be allowed.\n\nAs stated in another communication, the Department has under consideration the question of per capita grants payable to schools of this class, and the claims of the Fort Alexander School will not be lost sight of.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Father Poitras,\nThe Juniorate,\nCumberland St.,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je veux faire part de cette visite explicative, j'abonde dans le sens de l'inspecteur MacKenzie qui a trouv\u00e9 insuffisante ma fa\u00e7on d'agir envers le D\u00e9partement en marquant sur ma liste pr\u00e9sente des enfants que j'aurais d\u00fb porter avant l'impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 je me suis trouv\u00e9e pour faire de nouvelles admissions.

Je ne peux pas me prononcer l\u00e0-dessus; seulement je peux dire que lors de ma derni\u00e8re visite en f\u00e9vrier dernier, marquant de feuilles d'admission comme il m'en manque encore aujourd'hui, plus d'une vingtaine de certificats de sant\u00e9 devaient m'\u00eatre envoy\u00e9s de Winnipeg dans un bateau et voil\u00e0 plus de deux mois que je les attends.

Frank Oliver,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI hasten to send you by your agent at Selkirk my returns for the last quarter. I wish to precede them with a note of explanations. I agree with Inspector McKenna, who found my way of acting in regard to the Department incorrect in marking on my pay-list as present children whom I ought to have set down as absent. Being unable to accept new admissions constrains me to act in that manner. Has there been neglect on my part, or on the part of Dr. Steep? I do not wish to blame anyone; only I can say that on the occasion of his last visit in February, last, for want of forms of admission (as I am still lacking them today), more than twenty certificates of health were to be sent me from Winnipeg in a fortnight; now for more than two months I have been waiting for them. In order to obviate such a regrettable inconvenience, especially for my school, I beg the Department to authorize me to ask in some manner for the inspection of the doctor.\n\nIn the hope that this word of explanation will be agreeable to the Department, and that it will be kind enough to accede to my request,\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nPh. Vales, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 4, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to an examination of pupils at the Fort Alexander Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that there was any delay in having these children examined and entered on the roll of the school. Already two lots of reports have been sent you by mail and it seems strange to the Department that they did not reach you as there never have been any complaints in the past in reference to the delivery of mail to the school. A further supply is now being sent you under separate cover by registered mail and as soon as you receive them you will be good enough to see that they are filled in and signed with as little delay as possible. In future it would be well for you, should such a condition again arise, to write out yourself blank forms of application for the doctor's signature, so that there will not be any unnecessary delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

There were about twenty-five cases when I arrived there, a good many of them were convalescing, but there were several very severe cases in the acute stage. There had been forty-five deaths since the epidemic started, on that reserve. There were no deaths while I was there, and all appeared to be getting better when I left, and no new cases had developed, so I think perhaps they have seen the last of it there.\n\nI find that a great many of the deaths have been among the feeble and tubercular cases, and perhaps in a certain sense, it is a kind act of Providence, that they should be cleaned up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO.I.Grain.\nOctober 6th 1920.\n\nSuperintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Indian school at Fort Alexander, Man.\n\nSergius Bruyere, Esq. has requested that I write to you in reference to the above named school.\n\nHe states that he represents a large number of the Indians in the reserve at Fort Alexander and who send their children to the government school. Their complaint is that there is very little or no book teaching at the above school. The priest or teacher compels the children to work all day in his garden, digging potatoes and in the threshing.\n\nThey also complain that there is no discipline outside of the school and that the children swear and use very bad language at persons who pass by the school.\n\nTheir principal complaint appears to be with the teacher in charge of the school as they think that he is incompetent and is not a fit and proper person to be in charge of children.\n\nWould it be possible for you to look into their complaint and let me know if they have any grounds for making same.\n\nMy client appeared to be sincere and did not seem to be acting from an ulterior motive.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you upon completion of your inspection.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R. Bunn, Winnipeg, and has asked him to furnish a full report. Mr. Bunn has also been requested to see you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Ross, Barrister and Solicitor, 408 McIntyre Block, Winnipeg, Man for one Sergius Bruyere, an Indian, #226 of Fort Alexander Band.\n\nI have called on Mr. Ross at his office here, and I have talked over this matter with him, and I have explained to him that I had been requested to look fully into this matter as soon as possible. I also explained to him that I had, at the request of the Principal, on one occasion assembled the older boys before the whole school and the staff, and I did this to tell them that I had been informed that they were accused of being in habit of swearing. I asked the boys if they could claim that they had learned this habit in school, and they acknowledged that they had not, which statement I said must be true, as I was sure that they were taught correct conduct by everybody who was there to teach them. I also told Mr. Ross that the parents interfered about leave, so that I had to ask the principal to reduce the leave to not more than one week end per month at home. I also explained that I had seen the pupils at black-board exercises, and I was favorably impressed with their proficiency in this work, in spelling, writing and arithmetic.\n\nI shall look further into this matter when I visit this school, I told Mr. Ross this.\n\nMr. Ross in turn told me that he took the action he did, so that he might be able to show this man that his complaint\nwas receiving attention, and that he would be able to tell this man, if he called again, that the Inspector had been in to see him, and that the matter would be fully looked into.\n\nThis man Sergius Bruyere is rather a bright man, but his energy is directed along the complaining line. I have met him, and I have told him it would be better if he would help the school by helping the staff to maintain good discipline. He is inclined to be a busybody with wrong ideals as to the functions of the school. This man's claim that he is representing a number of the Indians, is, in my opinion, rather an exaggerated one.\n\nI told this man on a previous occasion that any of his claims on behalf of his own children, would have to be according to regulations and the reports of the School Authorities and the records of the School, and was not in any manner a sentimental matter, that these rewards went to all good pupils without any favors.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Boarding School.\nFort Alexander, Man.\nApril 2nd, 1921.\n\nMr. J.D. McLean, Assistant Deputy\n& Secretary of Ind.Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indian School of Fort Alexander, being situated in the district of the Lake Winnipeg, is altogether deprived of roads in the good season, and it can be reached only by boat, via Victoria Beach.\n\nDuring the past years, we have been using an old gasoline boat, graciously placed at the disposal of the school by our Congregation; but presently that boat is out of order. Besides being unsafe, on account of its shape, it would cost too much for repairs. So now we are facing the necessity of having a new boat, or of undergoing large expenses with many unpleasant and costly delays because there is no boat service of any kind on the lake. The way by land, via Lac du Bonnet, cannot be considered on account of the distance, -60 miles,- and the absence of roads.\n\nI have been making inquiries as to the best and cheapest way to have a serviceable boat, and I submit to your approval the following:\n\n1o. The buying of a three cylinders, 12 H.P. gasoline engine (Canadian Fairbanks-Morse make.) cost $600.00.\n\n2o. The building, by experienced men, of a boat suitable for navigation on the rough waters of Lake Winnipeg. Cost of material & workmanship, etc.,...$300.00\n\nI think, Dear Sir, that there will be no ob\njection in granting this request. The Fort Alexander School belongs to the Department, and, no doubt, this matter of \"transportation\" is a matter of prime necessity for our school; therefore, I feel confident of having your kind support.\n\nTrusting that I will receive an early and favorable answer, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find a communication from the Rev. P. Bousquet, O.M.I., Principal of the Fort Alexander Boarding School, in which he requests assistance to build a gasoline launch for the benefit of the school.\n\nThe Principal called on Mr. Inspector J.R. Bunn in regard to his demand, but being absent he has appealed to me to forward and recommend his request to the Department.\n\nI beg to say that being acquainted with the necessity and difficulty of the transportation to the Fort Alexander Boarding School and the utility of a gasoline boat in connection with this institution, that I concur with the statement made by the Reverend Father and would strongly recommend that his request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Fort Alexander Boarding School, in which he requests assistance to build a gasoline launch for the use of the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable to comply with this request at the present time, as it has no funds from which to pay a grant for the purpose.\n\nIf an advance on the per capita grant, re-payment to be spread over the current fiscal year, would be of any assistance, the Department will, upon a request for the same, make an advance up to $1,000.00, it being understood that this advance will be repaid from the per capita earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1922.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Latulippe, Indian Agent in Selkirk, Man., No. 125-1-1-, dated from Ottawa, 9/4/21, in which you state that you are unable to comply with our wish of helping us to build a gazoline boat for our Indian School at Fort Alexander, because the Department has no funds at the present time, from which to pay a grant for the purpose; and in your kindness you offer to advance $1000.00 on the capita grant of the current fiscal year.\n\nAllow me, dear Sir, to state that your offer is indeed highly appreciated; but here I desire to beg of your kindness, not a mere loan only, but an entire gift to our School, which belongs to the Government, and we are sure that you will not refuse our request as it is of utmost necessity. We are not enlisting the many such favors other schools are receiving, nevertheless we are convinced that if you have favors to confer, you will no doubt bestow them first on the Indian Department Schools.\n\nIf the Department is unable to grant our request this year, kindly, dear Sir, let us be informed that we will be repaid next year, for the expenses of the construction of boat mentioned; and we will try to find the money necessary for the expenses contracted.\n2.\n\nTrusting to have from you soon, and thanking you\nyou in anticipation, I am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nP. Bourque\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed letter (F 15-a) from Rev. Fr Bousquet, re gasoline boat.\n\nI take the liberty of asking the Department to reconsider decision in the matter. A letter from the Department in answer to Rev. Fr Bousquet's request said that it was impossible, at the present time, to comply with this request as there were no funds available. An advance on the per capita Grant of $1000.00 was suggested with the understanding that said advance would be repaid next year.\n\nAs Rev. Fr Bousquet says, his request was not for a loan, but for a free grant. Two years ago, the Department paid for a wharf. Why not be logical and supply the school, (which is a government own-building) with a boat which is an absolute necessity for transportation of freight, etc.\n\nRev. Fr Bousquet, considering that the main reason for refusing his request was a lack of funds, is making a proposal to borrow sufficient money for this expense with the understanding that the Department will repay same when funds for a grant to that effect will be passed.\n\nIn a previous letter to the Department, Rev. Fr Bousquet has given all necessary details and I hope that his demand will meet with serious consideration and will be successfully dealt with.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6264, file 579-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn April last, the principal of the Fort Alexander Boarding School requested that the Department provide him with a grant to help him build a motor boat to be used in the transportation of supplies for the school. He states that the only means of getting in supplies is by boat and there is no boat service of any kind on the lake. He is 60 miles from the nearest railway station, namely, Lac du Bonnet, which, on account of the distance and the absence of roads, cannot be considered in transporting supplies.\n\nThey have been using a motor boat which was supplied by the church authorities since the school was started, but this boat is now unsafe and useless for the purpose.\n\nHe requests that a grant of $900.00 be allowed to enable him to purchase a three cylinder 12 H.P. gasoline engine and in the building of a suitable boat for navigation on the rough waters of Lake Winnipeg. He estimates the cost of the engine at $600.00 and that of material and labour in building the boat at $300.00. The Indian agent strongly endorses this request.\n\nThe agent was informed that the Department was unable to comply with the principal's request as it has no funds for the purpose but, that an advance on the per capita grant of $1,000.00 would be made, repayment to be spread over the current fiscal year.\n\nRev. Father Guy forwards another communication from the principal in which he states that the advance on grant would not be satisfactory and that he considers as this school is the property of the Government, the motor boat should be supplied. The principal also states that if funds cannot be supplied for the purpose from this year's estimates, and he can receive a guarantee that he will be reimbursed from next\nnext year's appropriation he will be able to borrow the money required and proceed with the building of the boat.\n\nThis request, Father Guy and the principal, which is endorsed by the agent, is submitted for your favourable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You have, no doubt, been informed of this increase in pupilage through Rev.

He also stated that there are sufficient children on the neighboring Reserves to keep the enrolment at the Boarding School up to the number for which a grant is provided, and that the attendance of the children living near the school as day pupils would not interfere in any way with the recruiting or work of the school, and besides would provide educational facilities for a larger number than if he were restricted to the grant earners allowed. He also stated that the parents wished to have their children home at night, and that they live near enough to the school to attend as day pupils.\n\nI will be pleased to have your views concerning this request, and whether you would advise that a class for day pupils be continued - it having been in operation since the first of the present year.\n\nMr. Inspector Bunn would, no doubt, be able to supply you with further information regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Aest.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th inst. with reference to the request of the Reverend Father Bousquet, Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Boarding School. Personally I am very much opposed to having day pupils admitted to our Boarding Schools on the Reserves. This will mean that we will be in constant friction with the Indians as they will all request the same privileges. I do not think, therefore, that we should meet the Principal's request in this matter. I am taking the matter up with Inspector Bunn, and I think he will agree with me in regard to same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Bunn in which he states that he quite concurs with me that it would be undesirable to admit day pupils to our boarding schools, stating that in his opinion to allow this \"would play havoc with the proper supervision and discipline of the resident pupils\". He adds further that during Father Bousquet's absence overseas he had occasion to fix the home leave for the resident pupils in this school to once per month as he found the discipline was too lax in this respect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M.

It will not be possible, for the above reasons, to provide a grant towards the payment of a salary for the tuition of Indian children who attend the boarding school as day pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I got\nmy grant in March; so I could expect to receive it just the same\nin June. I was so certain to get my grant, that receiving\nnot on time your letter authorizing Marie Catherine Peitevin\nas grant earner in the Boarding School,-I have put her name\namongst the day scholars. So, having not received notice, in the\nbeginning of June quarter, to discontinue our Day School, and having\nreally done the teaching, I believe to have right to\nask for a salary...\n\nYour remarks in the letter are very wise\nindeed if the day school continues to exist. So it will be discontinued;\nbut I believe I should receive any way a grant for\nJune Quarter, for I deserve it.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am of the opinion that this school should be extended to accommodate at least 80 pupils. The new addition should be placed at the east end of the present main building. I think this question of additional accommodation is very important and should be dealt with as soon as possible. This completes a description of the main school building.\n\nJ. R.

I beg to suggest that they should have these experts without expense to the Department, check up the electric plants at various schools to see that they are working right. This would prevent batteries getting into a condition that practically puts them out of business and this timely attention would save money and much worry and annoyance to the management of schools. This would also be a means of instructing those who handle these plants so that they would be able to avoid mishaps.\n\nJ. R.

I have noted that you are of the opinion that this school should be extended to accommodate at least 80 pupils. As I intimated to you in another communication, the Department plans to make some alterations at the Fort Alexander Boarding School, if funds are voted for this purpose at the present session of Parliament. I have to inform you that we have provided for a pupilage of 76 at this school for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYou have informed the Department that the Roman Catholic Church has a number of expert electricians, and you have suggested that these men could be used to supervise the electric plants at various schools, without expense to the Department. I am afraid that, if we formally intimated to the Church authorities the desirability of such activity, they might look to us for the travelling expenses of the experts. If you could quietly intimate to school principals, or others, that the Department would be pleased to have such supervision, it might result in a better operation of the electric plants in our buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I am pleased that you have taken the matter up in the way you have. I certainly realise that you would be almost sure to experience certain difficulties, if you formally intimated to the Church anything as to such an activity, even if it was only directly connected with plants in institutions operating under their auspices. I have quietly intimated what such action would mean, in efficient operation of plants that required so much technical knowledge as electrical lighting plants, as it was a measure of protection from trouble, such work would always have to be without cost to the Department.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nFort Alexander\nFeb 28th 1923\n\nHon.

I visited the school and surroundings thoroughly, saw the children at work, attended a concert prepared by them under the direction of the Sisters and studied their general behaviour. I must report that everything seems to me to be of the highest calibre and I feel sure that it would be a pleasure for you to visit this institution which I consider a credit to the policy of the Department.\n\nI can state that all the children speak English with great facility and seem to be proficient in their studies. A splendid collection of fancy and plain needle work was on exhibition at the School much to the admiration of the parents and the satisfaction of the staff and children.\n\nThe new addition to the building, though not completed, is a distinct feature and enhances the appearance to a great extent and of course improves the accommodation of the institution.\n\nAfter the concert above referred to and this morning during the Church service I brought to the attention of the Indians the work of the Department and you realize that it was an easy task for me to do so when the improvements made to the school and the results obtained are taken into consideration. It was a good opportunity for me to speak, as I said to the Indians, of matters about which I am perfectly conversant and I must add that it was a real pleasure for me to commend the work which is being carried on here by the Department. The Principal, Rev. Fr Bousquet O.M.I., and the devoted Oblate Sisters came in of course for their share of the praise.\n\nAs a few remarks and requests have been made to me I will enclose them on a separate sheet for your attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Grey\n\n597 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 13, 1923.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with general reference to the Ft.

(RG 10, Volume 6264, file 579-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nOn June 30th and July 1st I visited the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, in company with the Rev. Father Plourde of the Oblate Provincial office, St. Boniface, Man. I was impressed by the splendid site, a few miles from the mouth of the Winnipeg. The buildings were neat, but required proper fencing. The main building was well kept, but the roof and the interior of the old wing require painting. Several outbuildings also should be painted. A boat house for a 32 ft. launch is required. The barn which the Department lately erected and the implement shed erected by the principal complete the outbuildings required.\n\nThe farm is inadequate and I advised the Rev. Father Bousquet, the Principal, to make a report when the institution was prepared to do some clearing and an effort to secure more land from the reserve would be made. The garden and pasturage were very good, but field crops are inadequate.\n\nMechanical plant, house equipment, etc., is in good condition, with the exception of the light generating unit. I advised the principal to correspond with the Department in this connection and I see his letter is already on file. Eventually a washer and an extractor should be provided for the laundry.\n\nI believe a mistake was made when the addition to the building was erected. There are two storeys in the addition, whereas in the main building there are three, the roof over the whole being the same level. It might be possible, without great expense, to turn the addition into a three story structure, thus providing two dormitories and a classroom below.\n\nI purpose purchasing two sewing machines, which are urgently required, and sending authority to the agent to secure 125 ft. of rope, suitable for girls' swings.\n\nI learned that Inspector Christianson visited the school a few weeks before I did, for the purpose of determining what painting should be undertaken. He arrived in the late evening after dark and left about 2 hours afterwards.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., January 22, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nRegarding the report that was brought to the attention of the Minister, the Honorable Mr. Stewart, that, at the time of my visit to Fort Alexander last summer in connection with the painting of the school, I did not arrive there until after dark, and that I requested that the children be got out of bed in order that I might see them - which request was refused by the Principal and Sisters - I might say that in looking up my daily journal I find that I visited this institution on Monday, the 9th of June, at the season when the days are about the longest.\n\nI cannot say at just what time I arrived at Fort Alexander School, but at this time of the year it is daylight until between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and I can well remember viewing clearly the lay of the country, the situation of the buildings and the general surroundings; in fact, there was sufficient light to enable one to carry on a game of golf or any other outdoor game.\n\nI first looked at the out-buildings, and with the Principal I measured them. We then went inside the school and viewed the downstairs rooms of the building.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI made no request to see the children. I had no disagreement of any nature with the Principal, and I must say that when I left the school he acted in a very friendly way and expressed the hope that I would have a chance to visit the school again. Evidently what has been rankling in his mind since is, that he had estimated for $2,000.00 for painting and had been advised that this was allowed, but after my visit the appropriation was cut down to $500.00.\n\nThe foregoing remarks are the true facts of the case. Whoever made the statements referred to in the beginning of my letter did so with malicious intent. I consider that I treated the school very liberally by recommending an expenditure of $500.00 for painting, and if I had to do it over again I would not change my mind in any way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The grades taught range from 1 to 7.\nThe work accomplished in the classroom here is very good, and\nI consider the children are receiving an excellent training\nat this school. The girls are taught cooking, general\nhousework and sewing. The school throughout is in very good\nrepair.\n\nThe crop at the school was very good this\nyear. They seeded a total of 130 acres last spring to\nwheat, oats, beans and peas. The oat crop yielded 98 bus.\nto the acre; this is an indication that a good crop can be\nraised in this part of the country. Of course, a lot of\nbrushing has to be done before the land can be put under\ncultivation. Wheat was also raised successfully, but only\na small quantity was seeded.\n\nThis school own 50 head of cattle; there\nare 15 milk cows in this herd, and 10 cows were being\nmilked at the time of my visit.

Therefore, the older boys receive a good training in stock raising and farming.\n\nSister St. Charles, the Mother Superior, is a very outstanding type of woman, and the girls, in my opinion, receive an exceptionally good training at this institution. I was well impressed with the results being obtained by the school on the reserve. As you are aware, in many cases, we find that after a girl is out of school for a year, she goes back to her old mode of living. However, this is not the case on this reserve. The girls who have attended this school are good housekeepers and keep their homes and children clean and tidy. As I have already pointed out in my general report, the homes on this reserve are exceptionally well kept. No doubt the nurse who was there for a year left a good impression; the Agent also visits the homes regularly, but the main factor in bringing about this condition is the influence of the school, and I am sure it is gratifying to the Department to know that results are being obtained by this institution.\n\nThe children are well cared for and well fed. I heard no complaints. The grounds are well kept, and as a whole, I found everything very satisfactory here.\n\nAt the time the clinic was held at this school several years ago, it was found that approximately ninety children had to have their tonsils removed. Dr. Bissett informed me he had already operated on thirty, with good results. He is doing the balance at the rate of three children per month.\n\nM. Christianson\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith report on the schools in the Glandeboye Agency.\n\nIt would appear that the work at these schools is being carried on in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nFort Alexander R.C. Indian Residential School,\nGlandeboye Agency.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nThe classroom work in this school is supervised by two Sisters. The grades range from 1 to 7. The junior room will accommodate 63 pupils, having 37 single seats and 13 double. The senior room accommodates 44, there being 22 double seats. At present there are about 120 pupils in residence, but a number are under school age.\n\nThe boys' dormitory is somewhat overcrowded, but this condition has been somewhat relieved by the extra small dormitory recently fitted up over the old laundry. This room accommodates 12 to 15, and has plenty of windows for the admitting of light and air. The beds in both dormitories were neatly made, and each child is provided with night clothes and a towel. The toilets and wash basins were clean and in working order.\n\nThe girls' dormitory was neat in appearance and well aired. The beds were tidy and all linen clean.\n\nBathrooms are provided, fitted with both tubs and shower equipment.\n\nHospital wards are provided for both girls and boys, but as there was no sickness, these were unoccupied at the time of my inspection. The children appeared to be\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nFort Alexander R.C. Indian Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nappeared to be in good health and are bright and cheerful.\n\nThe sewing room is well equipped, and the girls do some splendid work. They make all their own clothes and also many required by the boys, such as shirts, nightgowns, and pants. A good training is obtained in this department and one which is very useful in later life.\n\nThe laundry is well equipped. The washing is all done by hand power washing machines, and boys are used for some of this work. This department is well managed, and the work turned out is a credit to all concerned.\n\nThe kitchen was orderly, and the girls appeared to take a keen interest in the work. They are taught all kinds of cooking and also the art of butter-making. The food provided was all well prepared and served hot.\n\nThe school throughout was spotlessly clean and all furniture and school desks have been well kept.\n\nThe fire equipment appeared to be in good order. The fire escape doors were all unlocked and the exits free of snow. Fire extinguishers and axes are kept at the dormitory doors, and in several places, such as the laundry and furnace room, six buckets of water are kept in readiness at all times. The fire hose, except for the one in the laundry, appeared to be in good condition. No doubt the continual dampness, occasioned by the washing and drying of clothes, has rotted this hose and it should be renewed. A night watchman is on duty and makes his rounds hourly.\n\nA herd\nFort Alexander R.C. Indian Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nA herd of 50 cattle is kept, from which milk cows are selected. At present 8 cows are being milked, but a number are due to freshen soon. Butter is made throughout the year in sufficient quantity to supply the school.\n\nPoultry is kept, and at present they have over 100 hens. Sufficient hogs are raised to supply the school with meat.\n\nThe potato crop was very light, yielding insufficient for the school; in fact, the supply of all vegetables was short, due to the dry weather. However, the root house has been replenished from outside sources, and I believe the children are exceptionally well fed.\n\nGood discipline is obtained, and I found the children polite and mannerly. The school is undoubtedly well managed, and the Sisters render excellent service. The Principal, Rev. Father Kalmes, was unfortunately absent on mission work, but his assistant was on duty, as well as all other members of his staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, January 19th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter, dated the 10th instant, from Inspector Hamilton, reporting on the recent visit that he has made to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nHe states that there are about 120 pupils in residence but that a number are under age. He further advises that the boys' dormitory is overcrowded but that this condition has been somewhat relieved by the small extra dormitory recently fitted up over the old laundry.\n\nThe December quarter return, which has just reached the Department, shows an enrolment of 108, or 12 less children than the number mentioned by the Inspector. Are there children in the school for whom application forms have not yet been submitted? If so, you should advise why these children are in the school without the Department's permission having been obtained.\n\nAs you are aware, grant is only provided for 90 children at this school and, owing to lack of funds, it will not be possible to provide grant for a larger number.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you in connection with this matter at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nEdwin Millidge, Esq.,\nClerk-in-Charge,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa, January 19th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your 202-11 of the 10th instant, reporting on your recent visit to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Edwin Millidge, Indian Office, Selkirk, Man., is being written in connection with your report that there are a number of children under school age in residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI discharged seven pupils December 31st. One pupil died since. I sent four away who were not R.Catholics. I will have to discharge about seven or eight more, this present quarter, so I am about the number allowed by the Department.\n\nThe names of the pupils who would be above the number are:\u2014 Louis Johnston, 15 years, supposed to leave in June; Robert Prince, 6 years old; Louise Gagnon, 10 years old; Nora Gagnon, 7 years old; Nora Wheeler, 6 years old.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Signed) M.Kalmes\nSelkirk, Man. 7th February, 1933\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter, No. 125-1-1, of 19th ultimo referring to Inspector Hamilton's report on the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, I beg to report that on my recent visit to Fort Alexander Reserve, I visited the school but was unable to obtain any information, as Father Kalmes was absent.\n\nOn my return to Selkirk I wrote Father Kalmes and have received a reply, a copy of which is attached.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of his letter, giving the names of five children, I wish to point out that three of them, Louise Gagnon, Nora Gagnon, and Nora Wheeler are non-treaty. Their mothers were Indian women married to non-treaty men, and were after their marriage committed.\n\nThere are several children at present attending the school, and applications for them are ready to be forwarded to the Department. The parents of these children are destitute and the Father states it is difficult for him to turn the children away.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Millidge,\nActing Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to your recent visit to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information given in the third paragraph of your letter, regarding the Dagnan children, I beg to say that these three children should be discharged at once, as they are not eligible for admission to an Indian residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEdwin Millidge, Esq.,\nClerk-in-charge,\nIndian Office,\nSelkirk, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nReverend Father M.Kalms, Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, being at the same time in charge of a few Indian Missions, cannot easily attend to the regular administration of the School, and I believe it is in the best interest of the School to appoint a new principal. I wish to nominate Reverend Father Simeon Perrault, formerly Principal of the Fort Frances School.\n\nIf this appointment is approved, Father Perrault will take charge of the Fort Alexander School the 1st of October.\n\nYours devotedly,\n\nRev.

Kalmes, at present Principal of the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School. He will be replaced by Rev. S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 10th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nthis April 14th 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1941.\n\nPrincipal J. Beattie O.M.I.\n\nDated July 5th 1941.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Selkirk this July 7th 1941.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqa.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI, Henry Carty, certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alexander School for the Quarter ended 19.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | SEX | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0194            | Elsie Gourchene      | 14  | F  | Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: J. Beacher O.M.I.\n\nDated January 9th, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Selkirk this 27th June, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Bill Hill this April 27, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nVote No. 76\nClass No. 14-805\nTreaty No One\nVoucher No. 214/12\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 184            | Wilfrid Pierre-Tait   | 14  | 1   |      | Roseau R.        | 1              | 1                 |                          | 25/8/36                     | 90         |\n| 185            | Stanley Nelson        | 13  | 1   |      |                  | 1              | 1                 |                          | 25/8/36                     | 90         |\n| 186            | Bert Gourchene        | 12  | 1   |      | Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pr. Alexander School for the Quarter ended 19.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6264, file 579-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30th 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 1st 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Self-Hood this Oct. 2 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\n[Signature]\n\nVota No. [Blank]\nClass No. [Blank]\nTreasury No. [Blank]\nVoucher No. [Blank]\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 184             | Wilfrid Pierre-Tait   | 14  | 1   |      | Roseau R.      | 1                  |                          | 25/9/36                    | 92         |\n| 185             | Stanley Nelson        | 13  | 1   |      |                | 1                  |                          | 25/9/36                    | 92         |\n| 188             | Bert Courchene        | 12  | 1   |      | Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Alexander School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal: J. Prachett O.M.I.\n\nDated July 10th 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Selkirk this July 10th 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.
