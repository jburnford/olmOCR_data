Miller, one of our most esteemed and re-\nspected citizens. About four weeks ago he was taken ill with an infectious fever which finally developed into ty-\nphoid. No fears were entertained of his recovery, but unfortunately when from a slight draft he took a re-\nlapse and presently set in and although his physicians had been unable to save his sufferings, yet in Sabbath morning \nlast at about six o\u2019clock he passed over to join the great majority. Mr. Miller was one of the first settlers to this settlement, to which he came a number of years ago and took up a homestead a few miles from here. He owned considerable property in the east-\nern part of the town where he resided for past thirty-three years and still followed the avocation of a farmer. He took a deep interest in all matters per-\ntaining to the welfare of the town and his death was chairman of the Board of Trustees Prince Albert East End Public \nSchool. In religion he was devout and constant member and regular at \ntenant of the Presbyterian church. He was known as a kind and affectionate husband and father, a generous and obliging neighbor. He leaves be-\nhind him a wife and six children, three of whom are now living. He died of typhoid fever. His body was placed in a very handsome casket, covered with a beautiful black silk shroud, and left in his office as tyler of a Masonic hall. The funeral took place on Sunday last and the deceased was buried with Masonic honors by the members of the fraternity to which he belonged as tyler of the hall. The remains of the Masonic fraternity assembled at the hall at 12:30 and were driven there to the residence of their late brother and tyler and there remained until noon at which a part of the beautiful and im-\npressive Masonic burial service was con-\nducted. The services were officiated \nby the late Mr. D. M. B. Rev. \nRev. Canon Fleet. At three o\u2019clock the body was placed in the hearse and proceeded to the grave. The P.A.S. \nband, also consisting of the members of the Masonic fraternity, in full regalia; \nthen came the ladies following, followed by friends, members of the St. Andrew\u2019s Society and friends in carriage. On arrival at the grave the coffin containing the body was placed over the grave, and the Rev. Dr. Jardine held the burial service of the Fredrickson family after which the Masonic fraternity closed their eyes and the body of their late brother lay in its last resting place. The funeral, in spite of the severe weather, was attended by a large number of friends and members of the largest\u2014of not the largest\u2014over \nseen in Prince Albert. We are glad that this is the first time ever that a Funeral \nor fellow citizen ever preceded on a similar occasion in this district, and it is need-\nless to say he performed his duties ad \nand well.\n\nDUCHE LAKES.\n\nMr. A.
