You are aware, no doubt, that the school is forty-five miles from the nearest railroad point and the use of a truck is essential for the hauling of the school supplies. When the request for this truck was made, your Department had no hesitation in supplying it as it readily admitted its necessity.\n\nThe truck has now done three seasons. The mileage according to the last information received from the Principal is 28,605 miles. The truck is not at the present time in very good running condition and the Principal is informed by the Chevrolet Service Station at Dauphin, Manitoba, that necessary repairs and replacements would cost about $200.00, and that also a new set of tires would be required.\n\nIn view of the above, the Principal would like to be authorized to exchange the truck for a new one.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Fr. Ruest, principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, in which he informs me that the electrical plant both engine and dynamo must be overhauled as soon as possible.\n\nThe Mumford Medland Co. of Winnipeg have tendered $677.00 for this work. That price does not include transportation of the plant from Pine Creek to Winnipeg and return. As the school is about forty miles from the railroad station and as the distance by rail is about two hundred and sixty miles it is estimated that the total return freight charges would be at least $100.00.\n\nUnder the circumstances it has been suggested that instead of having the old plant repaired a new one might be purchased. The extra cost would not be very much and would be easily made up by the absence of repairs within the next eight or ten years. It is generally admitted that the diesel engines are not only more economical to operate but also last longer. A plant similar to the one now being installed at Sandy Bay would answer the purpose.\n\nWould it be possible for your Mr. Hamilton to get in touch with the Mumford Medland Co. of Winnipeg and ask their advice on this matter and also secure prices on a new plant as well as on repairs to the existing one.\n\nKnowing as you do how important a lighting plant is in a residential school, I hope that you will be able to attend to this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter recently received from Rev. J. O. Flourde, O.M.I., with reference to the electric plant at the Pine Creek Indian residential school.\n\nPlease make immediate inquiries with a view to ascertaining the present condition of the plant and whether or not necessary repairs could be made at a lower price than that quoted to the Principal by the Mumford Medland Company.\n\nYou should also let me have your comments regarding the suggestion contained in the third paragraph of Father Flourde's letter; namely, that a new diesel engine be purchased instead of repairing the present engine. It is presumed that in the event of a new diesel engine being secured a new set of batteries will be required.\n\nIf you decide to recommend the purchase of a new diesel engine you should let me have full particulars regarding the size required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

With this in mind, even though the speedometer only registered 32,269 miles, according to the roads it has gone over, is well equal to 60,000 miles on ordinary driving.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

This was purchased from Western Canada Motor Car Company Limited, Corner Edmonton and Graham Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba. In connection with the purchase of this truck I would refer you to memoranda from your office dated December 11, 1935, December 19, 1935, February 5, 1936, March 2, 1936 and March 11, 1936.\n\nRecently we received a request from the Principal for a new truck to replace the one purchased in 1936. The Principal points out in his request that the Pine Creek school is 45 miles from the nearest railroad point and the use of a truck is essential for the hauling of school supplies. He states that the truck is in very poor condition. The speedometer registers 32,269 miles but due to the poor condition of the roads the first year the truck was in use it is stated to have been necessary to drive it in low and second gear for considerable time and consequently the Principal considers that the distance the truck has travelled is equal to 60,000 miles of ordinary travel.\nWhen forwarding his request the Principal also states that J. N. Bourgoyn, International Harvester Company Dealer, 917 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, offers a new truck in exchange for the old one and $600.00.\n\nIn view of the report received on the present condition of the truck at the Pine Creek school it is considered that it would be advisable to replace it. Funds for its purchase will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMARCH 2nd, 1939.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n5th fl. Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sirs: Attention: Mr. A. G. Hamilton.\n\nFurther to our letter of even date and the writer's conversation with you in connection with same, we will be prepared to deliver the new Plant, f.o.b. cars nearest Railway siding to Camperville, for a definite sum of $50.00.\n\nWe would also be prepared if necessary to send our Service Engineer up to Camperville at the time of installation to check over this Plant. We would not charge you for his time but would expect you to pay actual out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nManager, Electrical Department.\n\nSGH/ELS\nTyped in duplicate.\nMarch 2nd, 1939.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n5th fl., Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAttention: Mr. A. G. Hamilton.\n\nWith reference to our conversation with you yesterday in connection with the proposed change-over of the LISTER Lighting Plant at Camperville from gasoline to diesel, or the alternative of replacing this Plant with a new one. We have pleasure in attaching herewith copies of the following letters:\n\nOur quotation to C. Ruest, O.M.I., Camperville, Feb. 15th.\nLetter to Rev. E. Lamontagne, Feb. 15th.\nQuotation to Rev. E. Lamontagne, March 1st.\nLetter to C. Ruest, O.M.I., Camperville, March 1st.\n\nIn addition to this we could also arrange for replacing your present Engine with a duplicate new Engine for $300.00. This price includes for the time of mounting this Engine in place of the existing one but does not include other expenses.\n\nThere are two alternative ways of handling the mounting of this new Engine, either by sending the complete plant in to us in which case you would pay freight charges both ways, or alternatively we could arrange for our Service Engineer to carry out the mounting at Camperville in which case you would pay for his travelling and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAs we understand you at present do not use the fully automatic features very extensively we would suggest that the Switchboard be reconstructed so as to operate the Plant as semi-automatic instead of fully automatic. This would necessitate an additional expenditure of $83.00. In this instance the Switchboard would have to be sent in to Winnipeg for reconstruction and this price does not include for transportation to and from\nWinnipeg.\n\nIn the event of you deciding to purchase the new belt driven Plant we would be prepared to allow you $50.00 as trade-in for the old 6 K.W. Generator together with the bedplate and heavy flywheels from the existing Engines, this price being f.o.b. Camperville and we would pay the incoming charges.\n\nWe trust the above information is that which you require but we will be pleased to give you any additional data you require.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nManager, Electrical Department.\nFebruary 15th, 1929.\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 4th, and having gone into the matter and also talked the situation over with Brother E. Gauthier, we believe the best arrangement would be for you to substitute a diesel engine for the present LISTER Gasoline Engine for the big Plant, but we would not recommend that you change your Fairbanks Engine to a diesel. This is due to the fact that the smallest diesel is 3 H.P. and therefore too large, coupled with the fact that you only run this Fairbanks engine for very short periods.\n\nThe substitution of a 10 H.P. LISTER Diesel in place of the gasoline engine would save you 75% of your fuel bill and from the information that you gave us in the above mentioned letter we would assume that your present cost for gasoline would be somewhere around $275.00 per year. This would therefore show a saving by installing the diesel engine of somewhere around $200.00 per year. These figures should not of course be taken too definitely as they are based on certain assumptions. If you could give us your present definite cost we can go into the matter more deeply.\n\nThe cost of replacing the LISTER Gasoline Engine with a 10 H.P. LISTER Diesel Engine and also the change-over of the present fully automatic Switchboard to a semi-automatic type arranging for push button starting of the Engine would be $667.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nThis price includes for all the necessary alterations but does not include for transportation of the unit from Camperville to Winnipeg and back again. It would be necessary to bring\nthe unit and Switchboard into Winnipeg in order to make a satisfactory job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nManager, Electrical Department.\n\nSGH/ELS\nCC to Rev. E. Lamontagne.\nRev. E. Lamontagne,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the writer's recent conversation with Brother E. Gauthier. We have pleasure in enclosing herewith our reply to the Rev. Russt's letter of February 4th. We trust you will find our offer satisfactory.\n\nThe arrangement that we have included for would make a unit similar in operation to that recently installed at Sandy Bay with the exception that the Engine would be direct coupled to the Engine instead of V-belt driven. If it was thought necessary to use a magnetic governor on the engine in order to maintain the speed almost constant this could be supplied for $25.00 extra. We would, however, point out that Sandy Bay is not equipped with this feature.\n\nPlease let us know if there is any more information we can supply you with.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nManager, Electrical Department.\nMarch 1st, 1929.\n\nRev. E. Lamontagne,\n240 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFurther to our letter of February 15th and quotation of the same date covering change-over from gasoline to diesel of one of our Lighting Plants.\n\nAs requested we have pleasure in alternatively quoting you on a complete new Plant similar to that installed recently at Amaranth as follows:\n\nONE 6 K.W. LISTER Diesel Driven Generating Unit utilizing V-belt Drive and comprising:\n\n1 - 10 H.P., 3 cylinder, 4 cycle, cold start full diesel engine, 600 RPM, tank cooled less tanks. Complete with day fuel tank mounted on Engine together with exhaust pot and standard exhaust piping.\n\n1 - 6 K.W.

PRICE.................................$1245.00.\n\nWe are sending a copy of this quotation to Rev. C. Ruest at Camperville.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED.\n\nManager, Electrical Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 1st, 1939.\n\nRev. C. Huest, O.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have pleasure in enclosing herewith copy of\nquotation made to Rev. E. Lamontagne which is self-explanatory.\n\nIf there is any further information you require\nplease let us know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nManager, Electrical Department.\n\nSGH/ELS\nEncl.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter No. 126-1-5, dated February 24th, and enclose for your information copies of correspondence re the lighting plant at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nThe present plant is in poor condition and undoubtedly the repair bill will be quite high. In addition, the engine operates by gasoline and, as noted by the enclosed correspondence, costs about $275.00 per year for fuel.\n\nYou will note several options are given by Mumford, Medland, Limited.\n\nNo. 1 - That the present engine be replaced by a new gasoline engine at a cost of $300.00\nFreight charges, approximately $100.00\nReconstruction of Switch-Board $81.00\nTotal $481.00\n\nNo. 2 - Replacing the present engine with 10 H.P. Lister Diesel, changing switch board to semi-automatic\nFreight, approximately $667.00\nTotal $767.00\n\nNo. 3 - Supplying a complete new unit, as per attached quotation addressed to Father Lamontagne and dated March 1st,\nFreight charges, approximately $833.00\nLess allowance on old 6 K.W. generator $50.00\nTotal $833.00\n\nThe No. 1 offer is $400.00 less than No. 3. However, we would still have the old generator which, at any time, might require expensive repairs or replacement and we would have a gasoline engine which is expensive to operate and not in demand. I am told this same engine sold for almost $500.00 more than the price quoted, before the Diesel engine made its appearance. If Mumford, Medland, Ltd., are prepared to make this reduction, it is quite evident the engine is not in demand. The reason for this is the expensive operating cost as compared with the Diesel.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nengine. I am convinced the difference in price can be saved in three years and therefore I am not prepared to recommend the purchase of another gasoline engine.\n\nThe second offer is only approximately $120.00 less than the third and we still have the old generator and a rebuilt switch board. In my opinion, this price is too near the price of a complete new outfit to be given serious consideration.\n\nThe No. 3 offer of a complete new outfit at the price of $883.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg is, in my opinion, the most economical investment, providing the unit is large enough to meet the need and I think this is a matter that should always be decided from expert opinion. Mumford, Medland, Ltd., are prepared, in this instance, to send their man to investigate and report, free of cost except for travelling expenses. No charge will be made for the man's time.\n\nI understand the present set of batteries is in fair condition. I see no reason to presume, if a new Diesel engine is supplied, that a new set of batteries will also be required. The batteries, as you know, are an independent part of the unit and the life of the same depends largely on the care and supervision given each day.\n\nUnless an expert investigates and reports, I myself, in view of all the information I can obtain, would recommend the purchase of a complete new unit as described in offer No. 3.\n\nI would be pleased to know what decision the Department makes regarding this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nMarch 1, 1939.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn a letter dated September 6, 1937, addressed to Rev. Sister Superior, you have kindly noted: \"I regret to advise that the Reverend Father did not renew his request for alterations in the upstairs infirmary.\"\n\nWe wish by present letter to renew the mentioned request. We hope, as you quoted then, that sufficient funds could be obtained for the alterations. I wish to advise that the material required for such would amount approximately as followed:\n\n- Water Installation: $25.58\n- Sewerage Insulation: $60.00\n- Lumber: $159.46\n- Ten-Test: $52.00\n- Door & Drawer Pulls: $7.47\n\nTOTAL: $372.51\n\nThe labor could be provided by our Senior boys under the supervision of our Engineer. Our boys will profit by practical carpentry training and contribute to build this new room at the lowest cost possible.\n\nI beg to draw your attention on a fact that we considered with certain apprehension. We notice that since last fall our school building has settled a great deal. The exterior walls are cracked in three different places. The interior is also working. Floors are dropping. I am informed that two summers ago, the boys' dormitory floor dropped a good two inches during one night. The floor was immediately replaced at its normal level and supported by a strong iron post. Actually we notice that same have dropped a good inch.\n\nThe floor in the Junior class room where we intend to build the partition for infirmary is in bad shape. The level indicates a 3/8 inch slope per foot, from the main wall to the outside. Would you think it advisable to send a competent man to advise us of what could be done and whether the building is safe. We do not figure that there is any immediate danger but before making any alteration, it will be necessary to recondition the floors.\n\nWe must have in mind that this school was built some 40 years ago, out of native wood sawed here by a local mill. Some cross beams are defective. In the last two years we found it necessary to support ceilings with iron posts which are placed in some cases in the middle of a room. Even though we support one ceiling it causes the floor to drop, from basement to roof.\n\nWould you kindly take this matter into consideration and advise at your earliest convenience regarding what should be done.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nG. Ruest, O.M.I.\n(signed)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 5)\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter addressed to Indian Agent Waite and written by the Rev. Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Camperville.\n\nIn view of the information submitted in regard to the condition of the building, I do not think any alterations should be undertaken at present. I would recommend that the Engineering and Construction Branch send a man to make a thorough inspection and submit a report of his findings and recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

The building was completed about forty years ago, the joist and cross beams being of native lumber sawn on the ground. The beams appear to be of 2 X 10s laminated, bolted together with two bolts, and it is my impression that this is where the trouble began. The beams have been jacked up in a number of places and supports erected at different points, but partitions have been built without support below the weight coming directly on the floor joists. I have no idea the cost of this repair and suggest that a building expert be sent out to the school immediately as I believe the condition is urgent and dangerous.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nIn accordance with your request, the writer visited the Pine Creek Residential School and made an examination of the same on April 25th and 26th.\n\nThe main building, 111' x 50', with solid masonry walls, was erected about thirty years ago. It consists of basement and three stories with attic. The structure was erected by the Oblate Fathers Order and there is no record of any plan of the building being retained. There has been alterations throughout the years but no plans were made of the same except in connection with the drains from the building.\n\nThe stone masonry walls of the building are in very good condition, the only cracks of importance being on either side of the southern wall. These cracks do not account for any of the trouble experienced with the settlement of the floors, nor do they at present affect the stability of the walls. There are minor cracks in the vicinity of the windows but these also are of little importance at present.\n\nThe basement floor would appear to be about four feet below the grade and is of concrete construction. The boiler room floor is also of concrete and about eight feet below grade. The other floors are all of wooden construction with plastered ceilings and walls. The attic is unfinished. The floors are supported by six beams extending across the building at 15-foot centres. The floor joists run lengthwise of the building on these beams and support the floor. On all three floors the beams appear to be directly over one another. Some beams extend below the ceiling but have been boxed in to present the appearance of being arched and the type of construction could not be ascertained without doing considerable damage to the existing condition.\n\nThe unfinished ceiling over the boiler room afforded an opportunity of examining the nature of the beams and joists but without tearing up the floor, it was not possible to examine the method of construction elsewhere except in the attic. It would appear, however, that the beams and joists are all made of planking sawn locally at the time of the construction. This planking varied from 2\u00bd\" to 3\u00bd\" in thickness and from 8 to 10 inches in width. The beams exposed over the boilers were built up of three pieces of planking, the planking standing on edge to give a beam size of 9' x 10'. The ends of the beams were imbedded in the masonry walls. The joists were also 2\u00bd\" to 3\u00bd\" thick and about ten inches deep and were spaced about every two feet. However, it was noticed that some of these joists did not extend from beam support to beam support but were spliced. The planking was not bolted in making the beam but simply nailed and it was noticed that where one beam was spliced to another beam, two long bolts were the only fastening. However, at this particular junction, a log up-right had been placed to support this connection.\n\nM.T.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 5)\nis altogether probable that the floor construction became lighter in the upper storeys.\n\nThe partitions appear to have been erected without any consideration being given to having the weight of the same properly supported - even the hallways are not directly over one another. Apparently, the central hallway partitions are required to support the six main cross beams forming part of each of the three floors. In the basement, however, the cross beams are each supported by four upright iron supports, two on either side of each of the partitions. These uprights rest on the concrete floor but whether or not there is any footing below the concrete floor was not determined. The only uprights in the first floor supporting the cross beams were two in each of the two classrooms. Examination showed that these had been placed when partitions had been removed. In the second storey there were uprights in the chapel, in the northeast corner of the floor; two uprights being placed under each of the three beams that crossed the ceiling. The only other upright was one recently placed to support the third beam from the northerly end of the building. In the third floor or dormitories, there were no individual upright supports. The two partitions separating the Girls and Boys' Dormitories, were placed directly over the third and fourth cross beams and evidently a considerable weight of the roof has to be carried by these two partitions. These two partitions were also fairly heavily loaded with wash basins, bath-tubs, water pipes and toilets and at times would have to carry a concentrated load of many children using the common toilet. The stair-ways from the dormitories to the main floor, are in the northeast and southeast corners and between the outer walls and the first cross beam from either wall. Whether or not extra joists were placed to support the stairways could not be ascertained without tearing up the floor but there were no uprights placed except one very recently. These stairways appear to be insufficiently supported on every landing.\n\nThe situation at this school is that there has been a decided sinking of the floors in the northeast section and also in the central easterly section. Everywhere the floors slope inwardly from the main walls of the building; the floors are very uneven, cracking of partitions is much in evidence, doors jam and continually need cutting or additions, radiators tilt; the plumbing gets out of line and in some sections it would appear that structural weaknesses exist, even to the extent of possibly being dangerous. It is quite noticeable that the westerly half of the building shows little of the serious structural weaknesses that have developed in the easterly section. The most noticeable defects have occurred in the northeasterly corner and extend from the attic to the boiler room. The sinking is especially noticeable in the Boys' Dormitory. Another very noticeable defect has developed in the easterly section from the attic to basement in the central portion under the third and fourth cross beams. It would appear as if not only the cross beams have sagged from insufficient support but that the joists have also sagged between cross beams from the heavy partitions and etc. The school authorities claim that the conditions outlined above are continuously growing more serious. The boiler room is in the northeast corner of the building and a support has been placed under the first cross beam and resting upon the top of the furnace.\nThe writer is of the opinion that it will be necessary to provide supports for all beams in the building from basement to attic. It is essential that proper footings under the basement floor should be provided for four uprights under each of the six cross beams and such uprights should be placed directly above one another on each floor to the dormitory ceiling. Undoubtedly, some of these uprights will hit into existing partitions, class rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets and etc., at most inconvenient locations. This may necessitate some of the beams being replaced by I beams or girders. Many joists may have to be cut to an extent requiring their replacement. To make repairs would involve tearing up floors. To place uprights, partitions would have to be exposed.\n\nThe present stairways should be condemned and replaced with fire-proof stairways. An additional fire escape should be provided for each of the two dormitories. It will be necessary to drain around the boiler-room section of the building to prevent seepage into the boiler room, also to provide a drainage ditch under the boiler by means of sump and pumping equipment. The boilers will probably have to be dismantled, proper foundations be provided and the boilers rebuilt. Relining of the boilers should also be carried out at the same time. The radiators, plumbing and etc. will have to be realigned. The masonry walls in the northeast corner of the building, which are not in any dangerous condition, should be underpinned in order to close the cracks. Examination of the roof showed this part of the structure to be in good condition, except that some leakage occurs around the chimneys, ventilators and at the bracing of the belfry. It would be advisable to endeavour to seal these connections and also to give the roof a coat of weather-proofing paint.\n\nThe writer has discussed the situation at this school with Mr. Waite, Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, who has visited the school and reported upon the same. The situation at the school has also been explained to Mr. Parkinson, Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Winnipeg. From these discussions, we have decided that it is impossible to give any estimate of the probable cost of the work that would be involved in supporting the floors of this building. The simplest and cheapest method of support, namely, steel uprights under all beams, involves so much cutting up of partitions, floors, ceilings and etc., that much additional work, redecorating and etc., would be required. It is impossible to estimate at present what limitation could be placed upon the repair work. Mr. Parkinson stated that the wooden stairways to the children's dormitories, should by all means be condemned and replaced by fire-proof stairways and also that two additional fire escapes should be provided. Mr. Waite had no suggestions to make with respect to the fire-proof stairways or additional fire escapes, but appeared to be of the opinion that the whole floor structure of beams and joists might need to be replaced if fire-proof stairways are provided, also additional fire escapes, and the floors are supported by steel uprights throughout and the boilers properly supported, a minimum outlay of $15,000 is involved and the final cost might easily amount to $25,000 or $35,000.00.\nThe cost of levelling up the floors of this building and lessening the hazard in case of fire, is of an amount that would appear to warrant a thorough examination of the building by a responsible official of the Architect's Division of the Engineering and Construction Service at Ottawa. A preliminary to the carrying out of any repair work would be a survey of this school in order to prepare plans of the structure as it now exists and also detailed plans of the floors and partitions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) D.B.

Mr. Desrosiers has been in our employ for quite a number of years and we have every confidence that he could repair the damage to the walls and partitions of the Pine Creek school in a very thorough manner and for a relatively small expenditure.\n\nWould you let me know at your convenience if this would be acceptable to the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In his opinion the general condition of the school is very unsatisfactory and his minimum estimate for repairs is $15,000, which might run to a maximum of $25,000 or $30,000.\n\nOn the 26th ultimo a telegram was received from Indian Agent Waite, advising that the building continues to sink and that immediate repair work is necessary.\n\nNo funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs at this school, and in view of the present set-up of our appropriation I know you will realize how difficult it will be to properly repair this building during the current fiscal year. However, on receipt of the Indian agent's telegram, arrangements were made to have Mr. Parkinson, resident Architect of the Department of Public Works at Winnipeg, visit Pine Creek and report regarding what he considers should be done. As yet we have not received his report and therefore no definite decision has been made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. O.

Parkinson, District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Winnipeg, I may say that Mr. Parkinson's report has been analyzed and compared with a report under date of 4th last submitted by our District Chief Engineer Gow. In this connection I may say that the most violent faults mentioned in Mr. Gow's report have been omitted altogether by Mr. Parkinson and while these officers agree substantially on the major faults and hazards, such differences indicate that the anticipated complications mentioned by Mr. Gow, and to which I refer in my memorandum to you dated May 12th, 1939, will be more extensive and costly than might be understood from Mr. Parkinson's report.\n\nAs closely as possible from the information available, our architect estimates that the expenditure involved in carrying out the obviously necessary repairs, would approximate Mr. Gow's minimum estimate of Fifteen Thousand Dollars, ($15,000.00) and might be listed approximately as follows:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Estimate |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| New Stairs (Mr. Parkinson's estimate)                                       | $4,500.00|\n| Suggested additional required                                              | 500.00   |\n| Jacking up beams, basement to top floor                                    |          |\n| (Mr. Parkinson's estimate)                                                  | 1,700.00 |\n| Possible inadequacy or failure of footings (Mr. Gow's report)               |          |\n| Investigation and possible repair                                           | 750.00   |\n| Fireproofing fuel room and Boiler Room (Mr. Parkinson's report)            | 550.00   |\n| Rebuilding and repairing boilers and diverting artesian spring              | 660.00   |\n| (Mr. Parkinson's report)                                                    |          |\n| Suggested additional required                                              | 340.00   |\n| Possible repairs to floors, partitions, plumbing, doors, planter, radiators, repairs and replacements to fire escapes, and making good (Mr. Gow's report) | 3,500.00 |\n| Engineering and supervision                                                 | 1,000.00 |\n| Contingencies (Minimum)                                                    | 1,500.00 |\n| Approximate Total                                                           | $15,000.00|\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is exceedingly difficult, therefore, to secure from the other appropriations an amount necessary to undertake even temporary repairs.\n\nMr. Desrosiers, who has had extensive experience in the construction of Indian day and residential schools for the Oblate Order, has expressed the opinion that temporary repairs might be undertaken at the Pine Creek school that would enable the school officials and pupils to occupy it with safety during the next school year. He estimates that these temporary repairs might be undertaken at a cost of approximately $3000.00. It is my understanding that Mr. Desrosiers will call and discuss this matter with you in the course of a few days. I am anxious, therefore, to have an expression of opinion from you with respect to the minor repairs that Mr. Desrosiers has in mind. The officials here, not having visited the school, naturally hesitate to express an opinion. It might be well if Mr. Cow also discussed the matter with Mr. Desrosiers.\n\nE. Parkinson, Esq.,\nResident Engineer,\nDept. of Public Works,\nFederal Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI naturally hesitate to trouble you with this problem but the limited funds at our disposal almost compel us to either undertake temporary repairs on the one hand or close the institution for a year on the other. Your co-operation and assistance, therefore, will be very deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nWINNIPEG, August 11th, 1939.\n\n2-- Mr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nAs far as the floor levels are concerned it is suggested that nothing be done this fall except to support the weakest part of these floors by putting in place three inch columns from the basement up to the roof. The school engineer can take charge of this work. Next year, during the summer holidays, iron beams and pillars should be installed to replace such wooden beams and pillars which are of insufficient strength to support the floors and roof of the building.\n\nI wish again to state that the present report is submitted in a spirit of helpful co-operation and not of criticism.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI just received the report of Mr. Pierre Desrosiers, our building superintendent, on the condition of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is not my purpose in submitting this report to you to suggest that previous reports received by your department have no merit. In a matter of this kind there is room for a variety of opinions and Mr. Desrosiers' report is submitted more in the nature of a suggestion than in a spirit of criticism of the report which you already have received from your departmental architect.\n\nMr. Desrosiers reports that there is an alkaline spring in the boiler room that is weakening the foundations of the boiler, causing it also to rust and disintegrating the cement floors.\n\nTo properly close this well, the boilers would have to be removed from the boiler room. This would be a costly operation and certainly cannot be done in time for the opening of the school this fall. The suggestion is made that it would be just as cheap to build a boiler room outside the building in which case the erection of fire proof stairs would not be necessary. The total cost of the new boiler room would certainly be less than the cost of fire proof stairways and repairs to the present boiler room. In any case, our superintendent is of the opinion that the boilers can be used for another year in their present condition.\nAugust 12th, 1939.\n\nMr. Harold McGill,\nChief Director,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing a conversation of this morning with Mr. E. Parkinson, architect,\nWinnipeg, Man., concerning urgent repairs to the Indian School of Pine Creek, Man.,\nI beg to submit the following estimate:\n\nFor the amount of two thousand dollars, ($2,000.00) I agree to install\nten (10) iron columns of three inches (3\") with plate at both ends, as\nshown on the plan made by above mentioned Mr. E. Parkinson, July 18th, 1939, and\naccording to instructions given.\n\nFurthermore, I agree to jack up floor beams, as shown on the plan, in\nthe best possible way.\n\nI am conscientiously convinced that with the above repairs the building\nwill be practically safe.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Pierre Demersiers)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 5)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFROM\nThe Office of the Resident Architect\nDirector, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Department of Public Works\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWinnipeg, August 12th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian School,\nCamperville, Man.\n\nReplying to your letter of August 11th, reference to proposed immediate necessary repairs to the above school, the subject was discussed today with Mr. Desrosiers and Father La Montagne, unfortunately Mr. Cow being out of town was unable to be present, however, he was later reached by telephone and informed of the discussions.\n\nThe immediate repairs for this year, are the replacement of ten wrought iron columns and the jacking up of the floors, where columns are to be introduced.\n\nMr. Desrosiers was advised that $3,000.00 was too high for this amount of work, and has submitted the enclosed estimate of $2,000.00, which I consider fair and reasonable, taking into consideration, the transportation of materials from the rail head at Winnipegosis.\n\nThe work proposed for the present year, may be executed whilst the school is in session, there should be little or no interference with studies and the building will be perfectly safe at all times.\n\nDuring the year 1940, an appropriation large enough to rebuild with fireproof materials two stairways, take down brickwork to two boilers, stop the underground spring and rebuild brickwork, is recommended.\n\nThe fireproofing of the ceiling of the boiler room is advisable, also the removal of wood partition to boiler room stair. An increase of windows to stairways is recommended, some parts are in total darkness.\n\nAt the time of inspection I was impressed with the excellent maintenance of the building; The Engineer in charge of the plant has devised many splendid mechanical improvements and the whole of the engineering equipment is very well attended.\n\nFrom today I shall be away from this office for three weeks, in the meantime Mr. G. Ritchie of this department will be pleased to render any further assistance regarding the subject of the school repair.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. Parkinson,\nDistrict Resident Architect.\n\nEP/B.\nEnc.\nOttawa, August 14, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Manitoba.\n\nI am attaching hereto copies of letters received by this Branch from Mr. E. Parkinson, District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Winnipeg; and Mr. P. Desrosiers, Superintendent of Construction for the Oblate Order - both of which, you will note, relate to repairs at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in Mr. Parkinson's communication, I recommend, for the approval of the Minister, that the church authorities be authorized to proceed with the replacement of ten (10) wrought iron columns at the Pine Creek school and the jacking up and levelling of the floors where columns will be installed, at a cost not to exceed $2,000.

In addition, the engine operates by gasoline and, as noted by the enclosed correspondence, costs about $275.00 per year for fuel.\n\nYou will note several options are given by Mumford, Medland, Limited.\n\nNo. 1 - That the present engine be replaced by a new gasoline engine at a cost of $300.00\nFreight charges, approximately $100.00\nReconstruction of Switch-board $88.00\nTotal $488.00\n\nNo. 2 - Replacing the present engine with 10 H.P. Lister Diesel, changing switch board to semi-automatic $667.00\nFreight, approximately $100.00\nTotal $767.00\n\nNo. 3 - Supplying a complete new unit, as per attached quotation addressed to Father Lamontagne and dated March 1st $883.00\nFreight charges, approximately $50.00\nTotal $933.00\nLess allowance on old 6 K.W. generator $50.00\nTotal $883.00\n\nThe No. 1 offer is $400.00 less than No. 3. However, we would still have the old generator which, at any time, might require expensive repairs or replacement and we would have a gasoline engine which is expensive to operate and not in demand. I am told this same engine sold for almost $500.00 more than the price quoted, before the Diesel engine made its appearance. If Mumford, Medland, Ltd., are prepared to make this reduction, it is quite evident the engine is not in demand. The reason for this is the expensive operating cost as compared with the Diesel engine.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nengine. I am convinced the difference in price can be saved in three years and therefore I am not prepared to recommend the purchase of another gasoline engine.\n\nThe second offer is only approximately $120.00 less than the third and we still have the old generator and a rebuilt switch board. In my opinion, this price is too near the price of a complete new outfit to be given serious consideration.\n\nThe No. 3 offer of a complete new outfit at the price of $885.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg is, in my opinion, the most economical investment, providing the unit is large enough to meet the need and I think this is a matter that should always be decided from expert opinion. Mumford, Medland, Ltd., are prepared, in this instance, to send their man to investigate and report, free of cost except for travelling expenses. No charge will be made for the man's time.\n\nI understand the present set of batteries is in fair condition. I see no reason to presume, if a new Diesel engine is supplied, that a new set of batteries will also be required. The batteries, as you know, are an independent part of the unit and the life of the same depends largely on the care and supervision given each day.\n\nUnless an expert investigates and reports, I myself, in view of all the information I can obtain, would recommend the purchase of a complete new unit as described in offer No. 3.\n\nI would be pleased to know what decision the Department makes regarding this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.)

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to the inspection of our school by Mr. E. Parkinson in July, we are in no immediate danger, and the reparations have been postponed till next year.\n\nLast winter, we had presented a proposition for the exchange of our Electric Plan.\n\nJust lately, the \"Clear out Plug\" in the top Cylinder having loosened caused trouble, as the water was running in the Cylinder. We doubt and fear greatly as to the length of time it could last in that state; so the actual problem is the exchange of the old Plan.\n\nA letter received from the Hon. Mr. Hoey, and dated March 21, 1939, concerning this matter says, \"In view of the possible expenditures that will be required in repairing the floors, we are not prepared at the present time to consider the purchase of the Lightning Plan.\"\n\nAs the said expenditures will not be made this year, I am convinced that with your kind cooperation, we could obtain the new Plan immediately. You have seen by yourself, last winter, the numerous advantages and the necessity of such an exchange.\n\nWe now realize that it could fail at any moment. In the actual condition of the Motor, a real break down occurring, could we possibly manage to go without light and water for the length of time required to secure new pieces from the Old Country?\n\nWith our children back to school, I am sure that you realize the immediate necessity of a new Plan.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your kind help in obtaining the authorization to purchase a new Plan myself, which I could have in operation in a very few days. Hammond Medland Co. can supply the Plan needed on a few days' notice.\n\nWe hope that you will give your kind consideration to such an important problem and your usual cooperation will be greatly appreciated.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

Father Ruest, principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School and quote the following -\n\n\"You would remember, as I do that on this occasion, you and Mr. Waite have kindly agreed on the necessity of a new kitchen stove for our school. The actual one being really too small and wear out. We have hoped that some days would have brought us the agreeable surprise of a new range. A year had passed, time and fire have continued their work on the old stove. The cooking top of the old unit is completely ruined and falling in pieces.\"\n\nI would refer the Department to my report dated November 18, 1938, to the last paragraph on the second page, in which I pointed out that the stove had been repaired several times and that I considered it unsafe as it has burned through in several places.\n\nI would recommend that, if possible, a new stove be provided, as I am quite sure another year of constant use, would not improve the condition of the range and I am inclined to think Father Ruest's request is justifiable. He requests that the range have three ovens and two fire boxes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM.G.

It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding on this is 582-76-12-422.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nNovember 1, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to a request of the Principal of the Pine Creek Indian residential school for a new stove. I regret that funds at our disposal at the present time will not permit its purchase.\n\nI may say that in the last few months the Department has purchased for the Pine Creek school an engine and generator at a cost of $933.00. An order has also been placed for a new station wagon for this school at an approximate cost of $975.00. We were also obliged to expend considerable money to make necessary repairs to the school. Under the circumstances it is felt that the Department has dealt very fairly with this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs the boiler room is in the school itself and is not fireproof, and furthermore as there is a hidden well which is causing considerable trouble every year and which has already undermined the concrete floor and caused the heaving of the boiler brick work, and as it is thought that it would be very difficult to divert the artesian well under the flooring, both our Mr. Desrosiers and your architect are of the opinion that instead of carrying out the repairs mentioned above it would be preferable to build a fireproof boiler room outside of the school but close enough to it so that the present chimney could be used. In this manner most of the fire hazard now existing in that school would be removed and the uncertainty of our being able to remove all danger from the artesian well would be eliminated.\n\nThe sum of $5,000.00 was included in this year's estimate to carry out the improvements mentioned in Mr. Parkinson's report. This sum would be insufficient for that purpose but would be large enough to build a new boiler room and transfer the boilers from their present location to the new building. As in the case of St. Philips the Oblate Fathers will undertake to carry out this work to the satisfaction of the Department and supply, if necessary, the difference between the amount provided and the actual cost of this work.\n\nAgain, also as in the case of St. Philips, it must be pointed out that the season is drawing to a close and that it is essential that the Oblate Fathers should receive authority from the Department as soon as possible to carry out this work. Otherwise winter will set in before anything can be done. I wish to insist once more that the building of this new boiler room would eliminate most of the fire hazard in this school and would contribute to silencing most, if not all, the criticism levelled at the school authorities as well as at the directors of the Indian Affairs Branch against leaving the school in its present condition.\n\nI, therefore, hope that a prompt decision may be reached so that no undue delay will occur in carrying out these very necessary improvements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 6)\nOttawa, September 17, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Repairs at Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nInspections have been made of the above noted school by Mr. Gow, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, who reported on May 4, 1939, and by Mr. Parkinson, Architect of the Public Works Department, who submitted a report to the Surveys and Engineering Branch on August 2, 1938. Mr. Parkinson estimated that the repairs and alterations most urgently needed at the school would cost approximately $15,000.\n\nMr. Parkinson in his report, and after a discussion with the Church Authorities and with Mr. Desrosiers, who has undertaken repairs at a number of schools operated by the Catholic Church, recommended the replacement of 10 wrought iron columns and the jacking up and levelling of the floors by installing new columns. This work was proceeded with last year and has proved very satisfactory.\n\nFrom the standpoint of fire hazard, the most urgent repairs and alterations necessary at this date appear to be the construction of a boiler house. At the present time the boiler room is in the basement of the school. Mr. Parkinson recommends the fireproofing of the boiler and fuel room at a cost of $550 and recommends the construction of new fireproof stairs throughout the building at a cost of $4,500. The suggestion has now been made -\nbeen made, however - and this suggestion appears satisfactory to the Architects - that a fireproof boiler room be constructed outside the school but close enough to it to permit the use of the present chimney. In this way it is claimed most of the fire hazard now existing would be removed. It is pointed out that in the construction of residential schools in recent years the boiler has been installed in an attached building and not in the main building.\n\nThere is in the estimates of this year the sum of $5,000 that might be used for this work. It is altogether likely however that the construction of a fully fireproof boiler room will cost more than this amount. However, the church authorities, in a letter dated September 16, 1940, have intimated that they are prepared to proceed with this work and supply the difference between the amount provided in the estimates and the actual cost of the building.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, subject to the approval of the Minister, that authority be granted to the Church Authorities to proceed with the construction of this building, on the understanding that the work will be subject to inspection by an architect satisfactory to the Department and that the cost cannot under any circumstances exceed the sum of $5,000.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev.

They are not holding the electric charge any more. Even when fully charged at night we find them nearly dead in the morning.

At the present time the Department is considering in what manner the amount provided can best be expended. No specific funds were provided for the purchase of batteries.\n\nPossibly funds can be secured for the batteries later in the year but at the present time we are unable to consider their purchase as we wish to have the very necessary repairs receive first attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The sum allotted should be adequate for this work, assuming much of the labour by local Indian labour, the mechanical work may be supervised by the Engineer, Mr. Patterson, a very capable man. The boiler floor is recommended to be at same level of present floor, and the height of room an existing height, with a fireproof ceiling and 5 ply felt and gravel roof. The height of building above grade will approximate 7 feet.\n\nIt is also recommended to remove and connect each boiler separately so that the heating of the school will be protected until final completion, which if the work is commenced immediately should not be later than November 30th.\n\nThe boilers will be set with new fire brick and the existing drain in boiler room transferred to new boiler room.\n\nAs the boilers are fired with cord wood, the recommended size of boiler room will provide ample space for a good quantity of wood, without the necessity of constructing a separate fuel room.\n\nOwing to the hazardous condition of the present boiler room, the construction of a new boiler room is very strongly recommended, and should be easily completed for the sum of $5,000.00 Meantime I will make a rough sketch, a copy of which will be given to Father La Montagne and a copy forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

The present set was bought in Sept. 1934. It would therefore seem to have lasted 7 years which is more than the average life of batteries.\n\n2- One Kitchen Range (Two fires, Three Ovens, Closet, Water heating equipment)\n\nThe kitchen range is so old and in such a condition that it has become a fire hazard and should be replaced. Your Agent must have written you about these two items and I think that his opinion will coincide with that of the Principal.\n\n3- Three Singer Sewing Machines; one with a new style treadle and another with an old style, and thirdly a shoe patcher.\n\n4- Weaving Looms\n\nWeaving Looms would be a great help to teaching the older girls the art of weaving, and the Principal hopes that you will be able to supply at least one loom this year.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In constructing the East wall of boiler \"A\", the lower part approximately 14 inches high is of concrete, and has cracked through heat expansion, a portion having moved out of position one inch, the crack continues through the brickwork. The building was constructed to that specification and, therefore, the Contractor may be excused for running the rain water from roof over a scupper, instead of hopper end down pipe as originally intended.\n\nIn general with the above exceptions, good value is received for an expenditure of $5,000.00, and the building is a distinct improvement from fire hazard as previously existed.\n\nWhilst in the building, I examined the newly erected interior columns and levelling of floors, and consider the work well done, though the floors are not perfectly level, there is great improvement.\n\nTwo photographs of the exterior of boiler room were taken and when prints are received, they will be forwarded to you.\n\nGenerally the Fathers of the school and the Engineer in charge, are very well pleased with the construction.\n\nI have much pleasure in submitting this report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. Parkinson,\nDistrict Resident Architect.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would return at once the accounts which I sent back to you, giving the detailed information requested in my letter of November 28.\n\nI also attach, for your information, a copy of Mr. Parkinson's report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Various reports and representations have been made in regard to condition of the batteries and also to the kitchen stove which is not large enough for cooking for the large number of children in residence.\n\nThe capacity of the batteries is now so low that it is necessary to run the engine from four to eight hours during the night, and this consumes considerable fuel.\n\nI pointed out to the Principal that owing to a state of National emergency it might be difficult to find money to replace the batteries and purchase an addition to the cook stove. However, he asked me to bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nTo Mr. R. A. Hoey  \nSupt.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversit\u00e9 d'Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nR\u00e8v. et cher P\u00e8re,\n\nLe compte ci-joint fut envoy\u00e9 avec les autres comptes montrant les d\u00e9penses faites pour construire notre nouvelle chambre \u00e0 bouilloires. Ce compte me fut retourn\u00e9 parce qu'il manquait des re\u00e7us. Je me suis fait parvenir les dits re\u00e7us et je vous envoie le tout. J'esp\u00e8re que tout sera satisfaisant. Vous verrez que je charge deux voyages fait \u00e0 Dauphin, le taux r\u00e9gulier est de 15.00 du voyage. Je crois que ce n'est pas trop exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de charger 12.00.\n\nL'architecte, Mr. Parkinson est venu faire son inspection cette semaine, il doit envoyer son rapport imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 Ottawa. Selon lui la nouvelle chambre aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre construite un pied plus longue. Il n'a pas sembl\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement satisfait. Je ne sais pas si c'est sa mani\u00e8re de dire les choses qui m'ont fait croire cela, mais d'apr\u00e8s son expression, je crois qu'il aurait d\u00e9sir\u00e9 que le travail soit plus soign\u00e9. Il y a certain petit d\u00e9tail que Mr. Desrosiers n'avait pas tout \u00e0 fait fini, comme v.E. couvrir les tuyaux avec de l'amiante, il \u00e9tait entendu que Mr. Patterson devait faire ces diff\u00e9rentes petites choses. L'architecte m'a demand\u00e9 pourquoi le contracteur n'avait pas compl\u00e9t\u00e9 son travail. Je lui ai r\u00e9pondu que l'argent \u00e9tait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 et que le D\u00e9partement ne voulant pas que nous d\u00e9passeions la somme assign\u00e9e, nous avons pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 laisser partir le contracteur et termin\u00e9 nous m\u00eame ces petites choses de peu d'importance, plut\u00f4t que de faire d\u00e9penser plus que ce qui nous \u00e9tait allou\u00e9. Il est parti en me disant, que consid\u00e9rant le temps, les circonstances et les lieux en d\u00e9finitive le travail \u00e9tait satisfaisant.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que le remboursement ne se fera pas trop attendre, car les finances sont basses. J'attends ce remboursement pour pouvoir contribuer \u00e0 votre \u0153uvre de Presse, comme il est bien entendu. Soyez certain que je ferai tout en mon pouvoir pour vous faire parvenir ma contribution le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n\nFraternellement v\u00f4tre in Xto Jesu & M.I.\n\nC.

The tank was leaking in quite a number of places, and the Principal suggested that a new tank should be furnished.\n\nThe engineer, Mr Patterson, claims he has repaired the tank on numerous occasions, and that it is now too thin to have further repair work. There is a danger of the tank falling apart, and this would mean that the school would be some considerable time without hot water.\n\nI asked Mr Patterson to let me have a sketch showing the size of the tank, and also the various outlets that would necessarily have to be cut.

Before placing the matter in the office of the Purchasing Agent we secured information from Mr. Waite to the effect that the tank should be 12' long and 3' in diameter and that when in use it lies in a horizontal position.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch now point out that before they can call for tenders the following additional information is necessary:\n\n(a) Gauge or thickness of the steel plate. Ashdown's largest standard tank, extra heavy, 10' x 3' has 1/4\" shell, 3/8\" convex head and 5/16\" concave head. The tank asked for is longer, and it might be well to have heavier plate.\n\n(b) What is the working pressure per square inch?\n\n(c) Is horizontal coil required?\n\nIn discussing the matter with them this morning it appears that the longest standard hot water tank is 10' and due to present conditions in connection with securing steel if we attempt to secure a tank larger than standard we may not only have considerable difficulty but there is certain to be a long delay.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIt would be appreciated if you would take up this matter immediately with Indian Agent Waite and obtain quotations in Winnipeg for a tank which you consider will meet the requirements.\n\nThese quotations should be forwarded as soon as possible to this office for consideration in order that we may submit them to the Purchasing Branch.

This matter has been brought to the attention of the Department in several reports. The store lids are now beginning to fall into the fire and the ovens are about done, being burnt out.\n\nAll fire equipment is in good shape with the exception of the hand equipment. I suggested that the contents of the hand pumps should be renewed. This has now been done, the Principal writing direct to the Department for authority.\n\nThe Principal advised me that at a recent inspection of boilers by the Provincial boiler Inspector it was suggested that a circular reservoir be made to hold rain water as the water at present in use was corroding the heating system. This was supposed to be embodied in the Inspectors' report to the Department. The circular reservoir to be made of cement capable of holding 20,000 gallons. The Principal would be willing to dig the excavation and to furnish the sand and gravel, if the Department would furnish the cement, forms and the labour of building. This would be an expensive undertaking at the present time, and this was pointed out to the Principal.

If possible you should quote a catalogue number. I am not certain that we will have funds for the purchase of this stove but if we have all the information necessary for the Purchasing Branch we will then be in a position to obtain prices and decide if the stove can be purchased now.\n\nI have reviewed our files and can find no recent report from the Provincial Boiler Inspector. Is it only proposed to use the rain water in the heating system? If so, it is considered that the reservoir suggested by the Principal would be very much too large. Presumably the Principal has a copy of the Provincial Boiler Inspector's report and I would like to have an opportunity of reviewing this before making any decision regarding the supplying of material to build a reservoir.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Pine Creek Indian Residential School, at Camperville.\n\nIn regards to a soft water cistern at the school, I would greatly suggest that a soft water reservoir should be built to prolong the life of those boilers. And I would recommend a reservoir large enough to supply all the boilers and the washing in the laundry also, so I would propose that a 1200 or at least a 1000 barrel reservoir be built.\n\nI made a call on this heating system and the high pressure boiler on June 4th, and found that the tubes in one of the heating boilers were eaten out due to hard water conditions in that locality which have been giving trouble for some time. The piping and other equipment is greatly affected by the hard water.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.H.B.\n\nProvincial Boiler Inspector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fathers:\n\nIn further reference to sample of water we are having analysed for your institution. We attach report No. W-16990 which we suggest that you place on file for future reference.\n\nYou will note from remarks typed on this report that the chemists do not recommend a softener for this installation due to the high P.H. Value (8.7) and they consider that this may be due to some chemical treatment you may have used on this water. If this is so, another sample of water will be necessary after pumping this chemical treated water from the source of supply.\n\nThe writer does not consider that you have used any chemicals and consulted our local chemist who gave us the information that we are mailing to Warlo Corporation as per copy of letter attached.\n\nWe will advise further on receipt of their reply. Otherwise the Crane Softener of Standard Make would soften this water as it is only 23 grains hard per U.S. gallon and a standard softener will handle up to 50 grains hard.\n\nWe regret that the report has these restrictions and we cannot supply a softener not approved by the factory.\n\nThis does not mean that we are refusing to sell; but holding same for further advice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCrane Limited\n\nBy E.C.

The correspondence attached is self explanatory.

As a matter of fact our experience with this equipment at other residential schools shows that the matter should receive very careful consideration before installing it. After due consideration I believe that the soft water tank should be built.

I again wrote the Department on October 5th, giving information, forwarded to me by the Reverend Principal of the school, about a water softener that is being held for installation in the school, if purchase is approved by the Department. The purchase of the softener would effect a considerable saving, and the work on the soft water tank is being held in obedience pending further letter from the Department.

If my answer is correct kindly mail it; if not return it to me.\n\nApparently the Department is prepared to send us material required to build a tank. I realize more than ever the advantage of having a softener instead of a water tank. Probably it would be impossible to build an underground tank of that size due to ground condition. The proposed tank will be 22 ft. diameter and 20 ft. deep. A hole measuring 20 ft. deep will be half full of water before we pour the cement.\n\nI wish you would kindly drop a line to notify the Department and ask authorization to purchase the water softener as soon as possible, instead of sending material to build a tank, which I think will not be as satisfactory as a softener.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 8)\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nOctober 31, 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith two letters received this morning from the Reverend Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School. One deals with Department letter 45,250-15-3, dated October 15, the other is a letter from the Principal directed to me. Both are in connection with the proposed water tank at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing two letters received from the Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch has already been requested to defer action on the purchase of the materials required for building a tank until a decision is reached regarding the water softener. We have already submitted to the Purchasing Branch the information that the Principal supplied regarding the latter. I understand that arrangements are being made to have Mr. Gow of the Water Power Branch, Winnipeg, inspect this softener with a view to determining if it is in good condition and is the proper type for the work required at Pine Creek.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nNovember 2, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn September 11, 1942, Crane Limited, 93 Lombard St., Winnipeg, offered Father C. Ruest, O.M.I., Camperville, Man., for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, two only BT 33 Crane Warlo water softeners complete with synthetic Dealso mineral, with necessary valves and fittings to connect same at $493.91, f.o.b. Winnipeg, tax included.\n\nThis quotation is based on calculations that the water contains 40 grains hardness per U.S. Gallon and that each unit will soften 1550 gallons per regeneration or salt period. The firm also states that they had the softeners in stock on 11th September.\n\nWill you please arrange to examine the softeners, if still available, and to give us your opinion as to whether or not they are in good condition and capable of performing the work required.\n\nI would appreciate your reply by return air mail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.J. Davidson\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nMr. D.B. Gow,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDominion Water & Power Bureau,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNovember 7, 1942.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson\n\nIndian Affairs Branch have submitted a requisition for two water softeners which Crane Limited, Winnipeg, Man., offer for immediate delivery at $493.91 net, f.o.b. Winnipeg, Man., tax included. This equipment is for the Pine Creek R.C. Indian Residential School, a Government-owned institution.\n\nMr. D.B. Gow, who at our request examined the water softeners, reports that they are new, and in good condition, and capable of softening a requisite amount of the alkaline lake water which has a hardness of 26 grains per U.S. Gallon.\n\nThe material needed to build a soft water cistern would cost $623.64 f.o.b. Winnipegosis. This alternative would ensure an adequate supply of soft water if there was sufficient rain. The first cost of the water softeners would be about $120 less, but there would be subsequent maintenance expenditures for salt and zeolite mineral. As the requisition calls for water softeners, it is assumed that the school authorities prefer these to the cistern.\n\nThe price quoted by Crane Limited on the softeners is fair and reasonable. We could not obtain them elsewhere without a priority as the steel used in the manufacture of the tanks is not rolled in Canadian mills. Likewise we have not been successful during the past year in obtaining requisite priority rating on water softeners for other western points.\n\nI recommend that authority be granted to place the order for the two B.T. 33 Crane Maxlo water softeners with Crane Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., at their quoted price of $493.91 f.o.b. Winnipeg, tax included.\n\nWMV/HC\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A.

The decision contained in your memorandum was conveyed to the Indian Agent who has taken up the matter with Inspector Hamilton. The latter writes as follows:\n\n\"The hot water has a severe chemical reaction on all metal and once it starts eating into the metal there appears no way to stop the process. Cold water does not have this effect. I saw a heavy 2\" galvanized pipe leading to the washing machine with holes in it like a sprinkler and yet the water does not stand in this pipe; but the water passing through is very hot. In view of the severe shortage of steel and the difficulty in getting galvanized pipe, I think consideration should be given to the purchase of a water softener. I understand a suitable one is available in Winnipeg for about $500.00. I would point out further that the Reverend Father has used very little of the money allotted this year for repairs; and I would say further that this money was not needed due largely to the capable engineer who is interested in his work and is constantly on the job. In view of the saving in repairs which makes money available, I recommend that a water softener be installed. I am firmly convinced the investment will pay for itself over a period of years in saving on plumbing, steam fittings and tanks. I would be pleased to know the final decision concerning this matter.\"\n\nI may add that when Mr. Phelan was in Winnipeg recently he met the Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School and the latter urged strongly that the water softeners...\nbe obtained. In view of the above, it would be appreciated if you could arrange to have the previous decision reconsidered.\n\nR.A.

With regard to the second suggestion, I attach correspondence which the Principal has had with Crane Limited, Winnipeg.

I would suggest that the Department forward a 6\" alarm gong to him. I think this would be large enough for the purpose.\n\nThe matter of the expenditure of the $700.00 was taken up with the Principal in front of Mr. Inspector Hamilton, the Principal advising that he had been unable to obtain prices for the metal stripping for the windows, but that a firm in Winnipeg had been written to, and he expected a reply in the near future. This firm, apparently, manufacture the stripping. At the time the Principal expected the materials for the windows to cost in the neighbourhood of $400.00 - $500.00. He also wants to buy cement for window sills, the approximate cost of cement and forms $200 - $250.00. The above are the Father's estimates and nothing definite can be stated until he obtains prices from the firms he has written to.\n\nIt was suggested that the grant next year should include items for the painting of the school and outbuildings, the repair of the barn and the erection of a new garage of cement and built fireproof according to the Fire Commissioners' approval.\n\nI am writing the Reverend Principal by current mail asking his to expedite matter if possible.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nIndian Affairs.

This bell has been ordered long ago, but has been received lately. I hope it will not be too late to cancel the order you have placed with the Department for this article.\n\nKindly find enclosed list of material which I would like to get as soon as possible. I am sorry that it took so long to obtain quotation of prices on the weatherstrip.\n\nThe weatherstrip could be used at any time of the year as work will be done from inside the building. This material is not as expensive as I thought it would be.\n\nThe rest of the material will be used as early as possible next spring.\n\nThis material being ordered immediately could figure on the current fiscal year expenditures.\n\nThe group proposition is certainly one that I would like to place. To meet the Fire Commissioner's approval steel beams would be required; I am not sure to be able to obtain this article. If permission and funds can be obtained I would forward list of material to your office immediately.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, C.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davidson\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: File 56,004-15-13\n\nWe acknowledge and thank you for your order No. 28290 and also your letter of December 13th.\n\nWe are not exactly certain as to what you require on the first item of your order. We believe from the explanation of it in your letter that the material you wish to return would be 1\u00bd gal. Thermene recharges. Are the five empty Thermene Acid Capsules from the extinguishers for which you require Recharges? If so, we suggest that you forward one of them to the writer at the above address for examination, so that the correct charges may be shipped against your new order.\n\nThe credit made on these would depend upon what they are. As to the 2\u00bd gal. Thermene Recharges, we shall be only too pleased, provided these are in good condition, to accept return of them at our Winnipeg Office less our usual 10% Handling and Recovery Charge.\n\nTrusting this will prove satisfactory and if you will forward the sample capsule, we shall advise you fully as to exactly what we are shipping, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nof Canada Limited,\n\n(sgd) Geo.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that our Diesel Engine, which has been in operation for five years need overhauling. New Cylinders and cylinder block are required as well as many little other repairs. We will have to send the motor to Winnipeg. The Mumford Medland Company will do the work. In the meantime we will have to install a few pulleys and shafts to run our Generator and water pump with the steam engine.\n\nThe approximate cost of repairs to be done on the motor may be as high as $300.00, of course I am not in a position to state the exact amount.\n\nThe new installation to use our steam engine to run Generator and pump will probably amount to $100.00\n\nAll this work must be done as soon as possible. I have already asked a man to install the necessary equipment to operate with the steam engine. As soon as this is done, we will ship our Diesel to Winnipeg to be repaired.\n\nPlease kindly ask the Department to cover these expenses, which are urgent, absolutely necessary and our school is not in a financial position to meet them.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nThe attached letter has been received from the Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, making request for certain repairs to the power plant.\n\nWill you please advise if authority is granted.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJanuary 2, 1945.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1945.\n\nMr. J.

Will you kindly advise in this matter.\"\n\nThe letter from the Principal stated that the whole hot water line in the laundry and part of the basement of the school would have to be replaced, as the pipes were plugged with rust and corrosion. He also stated that the Boiler Inspector had advised that the piping system and the fire walls of the high pressure boiler would have to be renewed. We wrote to the Agent for further information and he replied stating that the Principal was forwarding quotations direct to this office. I enclose these quotations for your information, and you will note that the expenditure for materials alone will be approximately $1,454 and in addition there will likely be a considerable amount for labour.\n\nIn view of the extent of the work requested by the Principal, I feel that Indian Agent Waite should have endeavoured to visit the school and make a definite recommendation regarding his\nviews about the Principal's request. However, he has not done so, and as we may have sufficient funds on hand in the current year's appropriation to purchase the materials if the work is required, it would be appreciated if you could arrange to visit the Pine Creek School in the very near future and let us have a report regarding what is needed.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou would probably remember, that on the occasion of your visit with Mr. Hamilton, in November 1942, you were in favor of alterations to be done to our sewing room. The room being too small for the number of girls working there-in, we wish to enlarge it by removing the North end wall.\n\nThis work has not yet been done due to lack of material and time.\n\nThe following materials will be needed:\n- 1500 sq. ft. of flooring 1\" X 4\" X 12' Fir.\n- 1000 sq. ft. \" Vjoint 1\" X 4\" X 12' Spruce.\n- 1500 sq. ft. 1\" X 10\" X 12' Spruce.\n- 20 pieces of 2\" X 4\" X 12' Fir.\n- 6 pieces of Fir veneer 3/4\" X 4' X 8'.\n- 6 pieces \" \" \" 1/4\" X 4' X 8'.\n\nNails and other material could be supplied by the school. The work will be done by the boys under the supervision of Brother de Grandpr\u00e9, Instructor.\n\nThe above mentioned material could be supplied by Mr. L. Marchenski or J.J. Crowe Co. at Winnipegosis.\n\nI would greatly appreciate receiving this material or authorization to order same as soon as possible as we are ready to do the work immediately.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Pine Creek School in which he asks material to enlarge the sewing room.\n\nI have no doubt Mr. Hamilton took this matter up in his report.\n\nThe room is far too small for sewing operations carried on by the pupils. I beg to recommend it be enlarged.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEncls.\nI wish to report that during a recent visit to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, the following necessary repairs were brought to attention and noted.\n\n1) The high pressure boiler that runs the steam laundry boiler. The firebox will have to be relined with new fire brick and new arches are required. The outside brickwork will have to be checked by a competent bricklayer and it is possible that all new outside brickwork will be required. One new grate is required for this furnace, which is a \"Pascal\" Fort Arthur Shipbuilding Co. Limited.\n\n2) The two heating boilers. These are made by the Vulcan Iron Works, Limited. All inside brick will have to be replaced and most probably all outside brickwork will have to be rebuilt. There is a spring under one corner and this has caused a sinking of the floor. The boiler inspector of the district has commented in regard to the condition of the three boilers. He claims they are not in first class condition according to test but certain brickwork and pipes etc will have to be attended to before another season. He further stated that the boilers at present are resting on the brickwork of the arches and by lugs in the outside brickwork. And that this construction was wrong and he will insist that the three boilers be hung from properly constructed iron standards. This would mean the renewal of all brickwork around the three boilers. He will be visiting the school in the near future and will be accompanied by Mr. Lock, Bricklayer of Dauphin and a complete report on the condition of the brickwork etc. will be furnished. A rough estimation of the brick required would be 2500 to 2700 field brick and 1000 common brick. A further report will be sent to the Department as soon as received.\n\n3) The main drive shaft will have to be reset and babitted. It is also necessary to have the shaft relined. If the shaft is too badly out then a new shaft will be necessary together with eight (8) new sets of hanger bearings. The approximate cost of the new shaft (two pieces - 19' and 24' X 1 end 13/16 inches) would be $33.00, and the approximate cost of the bearings for the hangers - $30.00. A further report will be furnished when the shaft is taken down and its condition noted.\n\n4) The Gurney Jacket Heater, No. 104-4253 requires all new grates. These grates are in sections and 7 sections are required. The total length of the heater is 65\". These grates should be purchased as soon as possible as the heater is in constant use.\n\n5) At the present time the laundry steam engine is being used for pumping water and driving the electric light.\ngenerator, pending the return of the Lister engine at present in Winnipeg under repair. This engine has now a decided \"knock\" in the main bearing and the slide rods are cut and pitted. The engine will require an overhaul as soon as the Lister engine is returned. The work is a machine shop job and it is intended to truck the engine to Dauphin and have the work completed there.\n\n6) By Dept. letter 126-1-5 dated Ottawa, January 5, 1945, $100.00 was authorized for the installation of a countershaft to run the generator. This is expected to be a permanent construction and to date the following is the outlay. Pulley and clutch $83.26 pulley and shaft $21.16. It is estimated that another $100.00 will be required to complete this work. Two (2) hangers will cost approximately $34.00 and the machining of key ways in shaft and the adjustment of bearings etc., the balance.\n\n7) Attention was also drawn to the condition of the batteries. There are 56; these were purchased March 12, 1941, Order No. 6224, File 37,440-15-16, at a cost of $563.75. The guarantee is for 7 years. The Reverend Principal claims they will not now hold the charge and should be renewed before the 1st. of September. Some of the plates are slightly warped, but the jars are free of any undue amount of sediment. I would be pleased if this matter is taken up with the vendor of the batteries.\n\nFurther reports on the boilers etc., will be forwarded as received.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nLETTER REGARDING PINECREEK SCHOOL IN AIRMAIL\n\nA G HAMILTON\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Water Line - Pine Creek School,\nDept. File 126-1-6 dated Feb.14/45.\n\nI was at this school on February 22nd and 23rd and checked carefully into the need for renewing the hot water line and repairing the pressure boiler.\n\nThis pipe line has given constant trouble all winter. The pipes look fairly good but day after day leaks appear. In attempting to put in new pipe it is often found necessary to renew several feet because the pipe is soft. Undoubtedly the pipes are heavily corroded and pitted, and with the condition existing the action of the water softener which was installed around a year ago, has loosened the scale. The result is a thinner pipe badly clogged with loosened scale, lime and rust. This cannot be blown out because the pipe line makes many right angle turns where this foreign matter lodges. I discussed the subject first with Mr. F.W.Bumstead, Plumber, Dauphin, and also with Mr. Bell, the Provincial Fire Inspector. Both men are familiar with the situation; and both are convinced that a new line is required.\n\nThe Department have quotations from different firms, as well as from Mr. Bumstead. I understand Mr. Bumstead has been in business in Dauphin many years and that he does good work and is considered reliable.\n\nI doubt if any firm would give a price on the work but from information gathered I am convinced it will cost from six to eight hundred dollars. Mr. Bumstead expressed the opinion that it would take two men from four to six weeks to complete a satisfactory job. The list of material appears large; but I understand it was carefully prepared after advice from both Mr. Bell and Mr. Bumstead. I would therefore recommend that the material be purchased. I would also recommend that the authority to proceed with the work be authorized as soon as possible so that the plumber engaged will be prepared to proceed with the work at a time most suitable to the Principal of the School.\n\nThe high pressure steam boiler needs relining with fire brick, new arches and one grate. The brick work around the boiler is badly cracked. I would suggest that the Provincial Inspector, Mr. Bell, be requested to give his recommendation regarding the brick work. If this is past repairing and requires re-building, I am sure the Inspector will request that the boiler be hung from a metal frame and then bricked in. This allows for expansion and slight adjustment without breaking the boiler water. In any event, the fire box must be relined with fire brick, the arches rebuilt and grate installed. If the brick work needs rebuilding the same bricks can be cleaned and used again. No doubt a small quantity of...\nnew brick will be required to replace those badly broken.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nIndian Residential School,\nGasperville, Man.\nFebruary 22, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly ask the Department to authorize the purchasing of a small Tractor Unit for our school farm. We have now a herd of 85 heads of cattle of which 12 milking cows and 8 horses. We are actually buying all the feed for our stock even hay.\n\nAlthough the sell condition is poor, I am of the opinion that a good proportion of the feed and hay could be produced on our property providing we have the equipment to do the work on time.\n\nThe season is very short in this part of the country. Doing farm work with horses and old style equipment is a very slow process. By the time the ground is prepared and the seed put in, the season is far advanced; consequently our chances for a decent crop are very slight. With a small Tractor work could done more rapidly with better chances of producing good hay and part of the feed required for our stock.\n\nFor this reason I am kindly asking you to send my request to the Department.\n\nMr. J.O. Carlson, Dealer agent for the Case Co. at Elphinstone has actually on hand a Model V A Case Tractor, cost Price $ 927.50\n\nMr. J. Allard has on hand a Ford Tractor, cost Price $ 865.00 F.O.B. Dauphin.\n\nAny one of these unit would take care of the work to be done on our farm.\n\nPlease kindly give this matter your usual consideration.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, C.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition to the tractor the Principal is asking for two pieces of power equipment; a 14A plow at an approximate cost of $102.00 and a power cultivator at an approximate cost of $127.00. He claims that this machinery is all that would be required at present.\n\nThere are approximately 140 acres of land under cultivation at the school. The land is stony, of poor quality and is costly to farm.\n\nJ.

However, the only account receipted is the one from A. Pelletier, Camperville, Man. Before payment of the account can be made, it will be necessary to have receipts attached from the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works, Fairbanks-Morse and the McArthur Machine Shop.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe. Camperville Indian School Boilers.\n\nLast week one of the inspectors was here from the head office and we discussed the situation of the sitting of the two heating boilers at the school.\n\nAnd we decided that if the proper foundation under the setting was put in that it would not be necessary to have the boilers hung in hangers. I have attached herewith a rough sketch of the foundation.\n\nI also told the inspector to get in touch with Mr. Stewart and send you a report on the matter as soon as possible.\n\nI also saw Mr. Love, and he said he would write to you right away. Hoping the above matter may be cleared up without delay. I remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHB.\n\nInsp.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 2, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian School, Camperville, Man.\n\nOur Inspector, Mr. J. H. Bell, reports that he has made an inspection of the boilers in the Indian School at Camperville.\n\nHe states that the ground condition under the cement floor of the boiler room is very poor as there is a certain amount of water seepage underneath the floor at all times and the boilers and setting have a tendency to settle down at one side or the other, due to the weight, causing the brick work to crack and fall in or out. I would, therefore, recommend that you make arrangements to have these boilers rebuilt, and, when rebuilding, that you put in proper concrete footings for supporting the brick work.\n\nThe high pressure boiler in the laundry room also requires to be rebricked as the firebox walls are in poor condition. Inspector Bell states that the foundation of this boiler is in fairly good shape above the ground level, therefore it would not need to have a new foundation placed under it.\n\nI trust you will make arrangements to have this work carried out as soon as possible so that the boilers will be in good shape for next winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Stuart,\nDeputy Minister.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Agency report dated February 26, on the repair of the boilers, Pine Creek Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith a report received from the Inspector of Boilers in connection with same. Kindly note that the Inspector now claims that it will not be necessary to hang the boilers and a sketch is enclosed, showing the foundation suggested.\n\nI interviewed Mr. Love at Dauphin on the 11th., and he estimates that the cost of labour to re-brick the boilers would be approximately $900.00. He further states he will not be able to do this work. The following are the materials required:\n\n- 3000 fire brick,\n- 1000 common brick,\n- 5-bags high temperature cement,\n- 2- arch bars 36\" X 14\" l-arch bar 36\" X 12\", 20 Bbls. lime,\n- 5-bags fire-clay.\n\nThe cleaning of the old brick and the tearing down of the brickwork could be done by Indians, and I beg to suggest the an accountable cheque in an amount of $150.00 be forwarded to the Reverend Principal for this purpose.\n\nThis work should be proceeded with as soon as possible as the work will take some time to do. There does not seem to be a bricklayer in Dauphin that would accept this work and I would be pleased if the Department would suggest a name.\n\nJ.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the bricking of the boilers at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nThe cost of the labour, namely $900.00, appears high. Probably this is due to the fact that the boilers will have to be bricked both inside and outside. It has occurred to us that before taking any action it might be advisable for you to interview the Vulcan Iron Works at Winnipeg, with a view to ascertaining what they would suggest. Possibly they have a brick-layer to do the necessary work. When discussing the boilers with the firm, I believe it would be necessary for you to know the serial number of the boilers. You should have this information. I would have asked Inspector Hamilton to interview the firm mentioned, but I understand he will be absent for some weeks on an inspection trip in northern Manitoba. Please let me hear from you again, following your interview with the firm mentioned.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure the material, and an accountable cheque for $150.00 for labour in tearing down the old brick-work will go forward to you under separate cover.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nM&S 16277 8462\n\nTO J H ASHDOWN HARDWARE CO LT ATTN: V J GUILBERT WINNIPEG MAN\nFROM H J DAVIDSON DEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT LINES & RESOURCES\nDEPT LANGEVIN BLOCK OTT\n\nREFERENCE YOUR QUOTATION MARCH THE 8TH 1945 YOUR DEPT NO 59 TO\nFATHER PLOURDE OTTAWA ON PLUMBING FOR PINE CREEK INDIAN SCHOOL\nCAMPERVILLE MANITOBA DOES THIS QUOTATION STILL HOLD GOOD.

It was on a washing day. Fortunately the children were having lunch when it happened. Would it happen while the girls were at work some one may have been hurt seriously.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to renew my request to the Department in connection with renewal of the Hot Water and Steam lines. Also repairs to be done to the three boilers.\n\nThe list of material needed has been forwarded to the Department some months ago with estimation of different firms, apparently nothing has been done so far.\n\nPlease kindly give this urgent matter your usual prompt attention.\n\nMay I remind you that this work must be done during Holidays... at once if possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 6, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nEXD.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to repairs to the hot water and steam lines and the boilers at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen the quotations were first received it was not possible to place the order, as we had no funds for the purpose. However, immediately following the opening of the new fiscal year, the Purchasing Branch was advised regarding the materials required. For some weeks they have been endeavouring to secure the articles and I am hopeful that the majority of the supplies will be delivered in the near future. I have no doubt both the Principal and yourself realize that owing to conditions at the present time it has been extremely difficult to obtain the material requested promptly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 11, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the materials required for plumbing and boiler repairs at the Pine Creek School, an order was placed on the 5th instant with the Ashdown Hardware Company for the majority of the articles. A Copy of this purchase order is going forward to you under separate cover.\n\nThere are two items on which we require further information, namely:\n\n2 arch bars 36\" x 14\" and 1 arch bar 36\" x 12\".\n\nWe desire to know if these bars are to be straight or curved and also the thickness of the same. If possible, we would like to have a drawing showing exactly where they are to be used.\n\nIf 36 inches is the actual overall length the bars could be heated and curved, if necessary, by a local blacksmith, but we would still need to know their thickness.\n\n20 barrels of lime.\n\nAs a barrel of lime weighs 200 lbs., or a net weight of lime of 180 lbs., the quantity you request would equal 3600 lbs of lime. This appears a large quantity, but possibly it is required. Instead of supplying barrel lime, we have been recommended to purchase lime in 50 lb. bags, crushed to pebble size. We are advised that lime in barrels is very seldom used now and pebble lime in bags would come considerably cheaper. Consequently, it is our\n\nRev. Chas. Ruest, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nintention to supply lime in bags, but before placing\nthe order we would appreciate your advising if you\nneed the quantity mentioned above.\n\nAn immediate reply is desired in\nregard to the above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJuly 14th, 1945\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have outstanding an invoice dated April 16th - $35.30, against the Indian Residential School at Camperville, Man. - copy attached.\n\nThe Principal of the School referred us to your Department for payment of the item.

The bricklayer has estimated that the amount of lime required will be 3600 lbs. I think the estimation is accurate.\n\nArch Bar.\n\nI wish to inform that I have already received 2 arch bars.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-1-5, Ottawa, June 29, 1945.\n\nAugust 18, 1945.\n\nWith reference to Department letter above noted, I wish to advise that I interviewed Mr. Anderson of The Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg, and was informed that they do not do any brickwork outside of the City of Winnipeg. I was, however, able to ascertain the cost of bricking a boiler of the size at present in use at the Pine Creek school. The cost, including all new material and labour, $844.00, this for one boiler.\n\nMr. Anderson suggested that I make an appointment with Mr. Trefall of the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel. I interviewed Mr. Trefall, went into the matter thoroughly and was informed that costs would be forwarded to me in the course of a day or so. I was further informed that there are only forty competent bricklayers in Winnipeg and work is plentiful. This firm thought the work could be done in a matter of three weeks time.\n\nAs soon as costs are received they will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nJ.

Father Ruest, Principal, Pine Creek School, to install the foundation for the boilers. This will be cement work and according to the sketch forwarded with my report to the Department on June 21st last. This work will have to be completed before a bricklayer goes up there to put up the brickwork of the boilers.\n\nI trust my action in this matter is approved.\n\nI also wish to state that Mr. Trefall is certain that not sufficient fire-brick and clay is estimated for the bricking of the boilers. I would ask that no purchases of this nature be made until Mr. Trefall's report is received.\n\nJ.

Bell, reports that he has made an inspection of the boilers in the Indian School at Camperville.\n\nHe states that the ground condition under the cement floor of the boiler room is very poor as there is a certain amount of water seepage underneath the floor at all times and the boilers and setting have a tendency to settle down at one side or the other, due to the weight, causing the brick work to crack and fall in or out. I would, therefore, recommend that you make arrangements to have these boilers rebuilt, and, when rebuilding, that you put in proper concrete footings for supporting the brick work.\n\nThe high pressure boiler in the laundry room also requires to be rebricked as the firebox walls are in poor condition. Inspector Bell states that the foundation of this boiler is in fairly good shape above the ground level, therefore it would not need to have a new foundation placed under it.\n\nI trust you will make arrangements to have this work carried out as soon as possible so that the boilers will be in good shape for next winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nRAS/MA\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Churchill, Man.\n\nIndian Agent Waite reports that the boilers at this school must be rebricked and in this connection I enclose a letter received by Mr. Waite from the Department of Labour, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nMr. Waite was requested to obtain prices for the work but was unable to obtain any quotations locally.\n\nHe has now submitted a quotation from the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company, Limited, and I enclose this for your information.

This engine had been in continuous operation for five years without any overhauling. New cylinders and cylinder block were required, as well as many other small repairs. It was not possible to secure the services of a competent person residing near the school to do the work, and consequently it was necessary to send the engine to the Munford Medland Company in Winnipeg.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

Ltd., Winnipeg, vouchered under agency number P.415, in which is shown certain purchases of material for the repair of the boilers, Pine Creek Residential School. The invoice is receipted by the Reverend Principal.\n\nToday I interviewed Mr. Trelfall of the Winnipeg Fuel and Supply Co. Ltd., Winnipeg to see if this material could be used and the amount of the invoice, McCurdy account, could be deducted from his estimate of $1,949.00. Mr. Trelfall claims the material can be used, although it is insufficient for the job. That his freight costs were estimated on a car load basis and he will now have to figure on local freight rates, which are considerably higher. He asked for a copy of the McCurdy account, which has been forwarded to him. I trust this is in order.\n\nA further estimate for this work will be forwarded to the Department in due course, showing the deduction it is possible to make in the estimate sent to the Department, dated August 25.\n\nJ.

Bumstead,\nfor $168.58.\n\nOn the above, you quote as authority for\nthe expenditure official letter of August 13, 1945 -\nFile 126-1-5. On reviewing that letter I cannot find\nany authority at all for incurring expenditure. My\nletter of August 13 simply forwarded a copy of a memo-\nrandum received from the Purchasing Branch with regard\nto certain items on Purchase Order No. 4311. This\norder had been placed with the Ashdown Hardware Company\nof Winnipeg.\n\nBefore consideration can be given to\npayment of this account, further explanation is required.\n\nRe: Voucher P 627 - Vulcan Iron\nWorks - $16.22.\n\nThis covers the cost of an arch bar.\nThe account is dated September 1, 1945 - Invoice #6255.\n\nYour voucher No. P 431 included a similar\ncharge and the account for the Vulcan Iron Works\nappeared exactly the same as the account attached to\nyour voucher P 627. Payment of this account will be\nwithheld until we hear further from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec. 1 | To Grant towards salary of night watchman at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School for the month of November 1945. | 40.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

If no authority was issued direct to the Principal, then the work must have been authorized by the Rev. Principal of the Pine Creek School.\n\nReferring to the latter part of your letter, re vouchers P431 and P627, I have to advise that one of these was a corrected invoice and that only P627 in an amount of $16.22 should be paid.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 8)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-1-5, September 14, 1945.\n\nWith reference to the above noted letter, relative to repairs to the boilers, Pine Creek Residential School, I beg to attach hereto a letter received from the Reverend Principal on September 22nd last. I have held this letter pending corroboration by the Boiler Inspector. I have written to him on three occasions without reply. It is assumed he will not commit himself in this matter. To date the boilers appear to be holding up and probably will until fires are discontinued in the spring.\n\nI wrote the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company on Sept. 20th, advising that I would inform them as soon as the foundation was laid and the work of bricking the boilers could be started. I believe they will be well pleased that this work cannot be done at this time, as they had more than enough work for the staff they had.\n\nI beg to request that the sum of $150.00 be made again available by May 1st next year and that 50 sacks of cement be purchased for work on the foundations of the boilers, by that date. Accountable cheque from the Department, No. J1299 - $150.00, has been returned to Receiver General account, December 15, Sheet No.13.\n\nThe Reverend Principal states that the foundation will be ready for the brickwork by July 15th., and I would be pleased to be advised, before that date, if the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company's price for this work is again satisfactory.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian agent.\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nSeptember 22, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering your letter of the 17th instant, I wish to inform you that Mr. J.H. Bell, upon his last visit September 14, 1945 has decided that work on the boilers will be done only next Spring. He is sending you his report giving reasons for postponement.\n\nEssential repairs will be done by the school so that we may operate during the coming Winter. Work will be done according to plans early next Spring. I guarantee that everything will be ready for the Brick-layer on July 15, 1946.\n\nCould you make arrangements so that a Brick-layer may be available and ready to start work on the above mentioned date.\n\nAbout 50 bags of Cement will be needed to build up boilers' foundation according to plans. Would you give me authorization to purchase Cement from one of the Winnipegosis Lumberyard, or would the Department place the order? I wish the Cement will be here not later than May 1, 1946.\n\nX X X\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nOttawa, December 18, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, in which you state that it has been decided to postpone the bricking of the boilers at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School until next July.\n\nBy that time it will have been nearly a year since we obtained the quotation from the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company, Limited. Conditions may be changed by next year and consequently I believe that about the middle of June you should ask the firm to give you another quotation on the work required and submit this for our consideration.\n\nWe will arrange to purchase the 50 sacks of cement and have it sent to the school before May 1, 1946. The sum of $150.00 will also be available, if required, and will be sent on receipt of a request from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAt present oxygen and acetylene is being used at Pine Creek Indian School, Brandon Indian School and Norway House Agency. The supply comes from the Canadian Liquid Air Company, Winnipeg. These people are willing to supply all the above points and any other schools at government prices if the enclosed contract is signed. This would perhaps not make any difference for Agency administration, but would be a great help to any schools using a welding equipment.\n\nI attach the contract and would be pleased to have it returned completed if considered advisable.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, 27th December, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to certain schools that use Oxygen and Acetylene.\n\nI reviewed the contract which you forwarded and I feel certain that none of our officials would sign it. If I understand the contract correctly it would oblige the Department to purchase these items from the firm mentioned at all our schools. As far as our schools are concerned we do not pay for either Oxygen or Acetylene. If these are required at the school, payment is made by the school from its own funds. It is possible that individual schools might like to sign the contract thus assuring their supply of this material at a set price but in that event the contract should be signed by the individual principals.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCredit Advice\n\nDecember 17th, 1945.\n\nMEMO.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from Indian Agent S.

In order to overcome certain local difficulties, the Principal, Reverend Father Charles Ruest, O.M.I., has decided to build two community centers, one for the Pine Creek ex-pupils and one for the White and Half-Breed population of Camperville.\n\nThe center for the ex-pupils can be erected either on the school property or on the Indian Reserve and we will be guided in this matter by the advice of the Department. The school site offers certain advantages, such as heating as I am informed that if built close to the school, the heating plant of the school is large enough to take care of the heating problem.\n\nIt is proposed to build the walls with cement blocks, to the making of which Indians and older school pupils will be asked to donate their time. They have agreed to this already, so no trouble is anticipated in securing this free labour. There is an abundance of good sand and gravel which should render the making of these blocks an easy task.\n\nOf course, a cement block machine will have to be bought. I am informed that there is in Quebec city a manufacture who makes these machines and sells them for $400.00. If the Department could contribute the purchase of this machine and a carload of cement, this project of a community center...\nwould be well launched.\n\nHoping to hear favourably from you I remain, dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, May 10, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the community centre at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I would appreciate it if you would discuss the matter further with me next week.\n\nWe would like to know the approximate size of the building that it is proposed to erect. You request that we purchase a block making machine and also a carload of cement. Would this be the only expenditure that the Department would be required to incur?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Community Center at Pine Creek School.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMany thanks for yours of the 10th instant in answer to the letter which I wrote to you on the 6th, regarding the above subject.\n\nBefore taking up the matter with you again, I shall communicate with the Principal of the school to find out the size of the building and the equipment which they propose to install therein. As soon as I have received this information I shall be in a position to talk more intelligently about the whole project.\n\nThanking you for your sympathetic consideration I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO\n\n16th May 1946.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Concrete Block Machine for Pine Creek Indian School.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThis morning I visited the plant of Mr. Hayley, Hurdsman's Road, Ottawa, for the purpose of securing information on the proper kind of machine to purchase for the above school. I saw Mr. Hayley personally and received valuable information from him. He advises the purchase of a Model C Clipper Stripper as well as a 9 cubic foot concrete mixer and cast iron pallets to handle the blocks. This machine can be operated with a five horse power gasoline engine which the school can supply. It will easily make from 6 to 800 blocks per day.\n\nThe London Concrete Machinery Co. of London, Canada, will gladly supply additional information about this machine and its various features.\n\nI am enclosing along with this letter, the latest catalogue of the London Concrete Machinery Co., with a note at the bottom of the illustration showing the machine which I was advised to buy.\n\nAs the building season is very short in Pine Creek, I hope that you will be able to purchase this equipment in the very near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, June 1 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nPine Creek Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment\n\nSHIP TO Reverend Charles Rust, O.M.I., Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Winnipegosis, Manitoba.\n\nPurpose for which required\n\nNote:\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nconsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Quantity on hand (1) | Quantity needed per month (2) | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 1        |                     |                               |            |       |\n| Model C Clipper Stripper | as shown on page 2 of catalogue of the London Concrete Machinery Company, Limited. |\n\n1 9 cubic feet Concrete Mixer with cast iron pallets to handle the blocks.\n\nNote:\u2014\n\nIt is the intention of the management of the Pine Creek School to erect a recreational centre for ex-pupils. It has been found by experience that such a building is extremely necessary in order that the teen-age Indian boys and girls may enjoy supervised recreation. The management of the school is providing the labour and it is proposed to erect the building of concrete blocks. In order to do so quickly and economically, the machinery mentioned above is necessary. As the building space at Pine Creek is short, it is hoped that the building equipment can be secured in the near future.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\n\nForm 37\n\nIndian Affairs.

He made a complete inspection and I attach hereto his reports.\n\nYou will kindly note that one of the heating boilers is condemned and a new one will have to be purchased. The particulars regarding this boiler are shown on the report. The Rev. Principal makes request that a new boiler be furnished with a steel fire box which will eliminate rebricking from time to time. It is further recommended and necessary that new tubes be installed in the other heating boiler and that two extra flues be furnished for repair purposes.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that the high pressure boiler be reset farther away from the wall and that the walls be covered with fire resistant material. Regarding this boiler, I wish to refer to my report of the 26th of February 1945, in which a new set of grates was requested for this boiler. These grates are still required.\nI also wish to refer to the above-mentioned report in connection with paragraph four relative to the jacket heater. A new jacket heater of the upright variety is very necessary. The tank for this heater is 12' by 3' tubular with a capacity of 3000 gallons. The water in the boiler room which has been responsible for the sinking of the boilers is evidently heavy seepage and it is recommended that a sump hole be dug and an automatic sump pump installed. This installation will require a two horse-power engine.\n\nThe heating of the School has not been satisfactory and the Rev. Principal has suggested that a vacuum system be installed.\n\nThe brick work of the boilers has been torn down and the heating boilers have been removed to the outside. The new excavation is approximately two feet deep and at the time of my visit this excavation was full of water. This will have to be filled with stone and cement to a height of four inches above the boiler room floor. All this material will have to be hauled. The reinstallation of the high pressure boiler will necessitate the tearing down of the old boiler cement foundation, possibly cutting the cement floor to put in new footings, and a request is made for a further advance of $500.00 in an accountable cheque so this work may be proceeded with immediately. The Rev. Father states that his staff is not experienced enough to refit the boiler connections after the installation of the three boilers is made and requests that the services of Mr. Bumstead, Steam-fitter of Dauphin, be engaged to do this work.\nI wish to refer to paragraph seven of my report of February 26th 1945 calling attention to the batteries, a new set should be installed before winter sets in.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 29, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nI attach for your information a copy of a letter from Indian Agent Waite, in connection with the above school.\n\nI would appreciate it, if you would arrange to have one of your Officials visit this school and submit a report on what is required.\n\nEnclosure\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Des Goutteaux of St. Boniface. Mr. Descoteaux was recommended by the Rev. Fr. Ruest, Principal, and I believe he would be the cheaper man if paid on a hourly basis. Railway fare would have to be paid from Winnipeg to Winnipegososis and I have no doubt the Principal would meet him at that point without charge.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Pine Creek Recreation Center.\n\nOn your last visit to Camperville, I have brought to your attention the project of building a recreation and training center for our ex-pupils. We have already submitted a plan of building to the Department through our representative at Ottawa, Rev. Father O. Flourde, O.M.I.; 100' X 35' X 18' made of Cement blocks. We have added since to the plan presented a full basement. Part of the building will be an amusement center the other part a training center for both boys and girls.\n\nThe following list of material has been produced with the plan:\n\n- 138 pieces 2\" x 6\" x 22' spruce for rafters.\n- 138 \" 2\" x 4\" x 22' \" \" \"\n- 5500 sq. ft. 1\" x 10\" x 12' spruce shiplap, for roofing.\n- 5400 sq. ft. 1\" x 4\" x 12' spruce Vjoint for ceiling.\n- 4480 sq. ft. asphalt shingles.\n- 40 rolls of building paper, insulation of roof.\n- 40 pieces 2\" x 12\" x 10' fir, window frames.\n- 10 pieces 2\" x 12\" x 14' Fir, doors frames.\n- 45 pieces 2\" x 12\" x 12' plates.\n- 600 ft. 1\" x 6\" x 12' fir trimmings.\n- 800 sacks of Cement.\n- 100 sacks of pebble lime.\n- 38 ft. chimney flues.\n- 2 kegs finishing nails 2 1/2\".\n- 10 rolls of wire for forms.\n- 50 pieces 2\" x 10\" x 12' spruce for scaffolding.\n- 50 pieces 2\" x 4\" x 12' \" \" \"\n- 500 sq. ft. 1\" x 8\" x 16' \" \" \"\n\nThe windows and doors we hope will be obtained from the War assets Corporation at reasonable price. We have already made some 750 blocks &f actually we are stop due to the restriction on Cement.\nNow Mr. Ab. Sanoffski is offering us 5500 sq. ft. of No. 1 Spruce shiplap at $60.00 per M.M. F.O.B. Camperville. At that price we are at least saving the transportation. Would you kindly interest the Department into this offer and obtain authorization to place the order with Mr. Ab. Sanoffski immediately.

This building was talked about at annuity payments, but I have not been advised concerning the matter by the Department. I would consider the 5500 feet of lumber an especially good buy and if the Department consider buying this material, I would request that I be telegraphed. I can then get in touch with the Reverend Principal by telephone. There is no doubt this lumber will be picked up quickly, as it is selling at $70.00 per M. locally.\n\nJ.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Pine Creek School Boilers.\n\nKindly find enclosed Return of Labor done on Boilers. Also Statement covering 50 yards of Gravel partly used for the boilers' foundation, the balance of which will be used for the brick work.\n\nThe heating system foundation is completed. The footing of one boiler made, before making the footing of the second boiler, the size of the new boiler will be needed. The sump hole is ready to receive the sump pump.\n\nThe brick work and footing of the high pressure boiler has been torn down and a new footing has been built up.\n\nDue to the fact that our Boilers will be moved two feet ahead and away from the wall, we consider that an other 2000 common bricks will be needed. Kindly ask the Department to place the order immediately in order to have all material on hand when the brick-layers will be here.\n\nNo sign yet of Flues, Grates for high pressure boiler nor of other items mentioned in your report of June 20th. I hope all this material will reach in a near future, as the work must be completed before the children returned to school.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

The grant received is $40.00 per month for seven months. You know that it is impossible today to find a man who would consider the job at such low wages. It is also impossible for our school to pay an extra $30.00 or even $40.00 towards this salary.

A raise of 75% may seem high. However, I do feel that the wage of $40.00 per month was very low in the first place for a responsible man, even though board and room was provided.\n\nI might mention that the Principal's of Portage la Prairie and Sandy Bay schools' claim they cannot obtain the services of a night watchman who would be at all reliable, for $40.00 per month.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nJ.

Attached to his report of June 20th are three reports covering the inspection of boilers made by the Provincial Boiler Inspector, dated June 5th and June 14th.\n\nAn analysis of points raised by the Indian Agent and the Boiler Inspector indicates that:\n\n1. High Pressure Boiler (No. 1) should be relocated to reduce fire hazard. This boiler needs new brickwork. Adjacent partitions should be made fire resistant and new fire doors installed to seal the boiler room.\n\n2. Heating Boiler (No. 2) is condemned and is not recommended for further service.\n\n3. Heating Boiler (No. 3) needs all new tubes and a new brick setting along with a new set of grates.\n\n4. The jacket heater is worn out and is no longer serviceable.\n\n5. A seepage of water in the boiler room has caused the floor to settle and work is now being carried out to replace the floor. The heating boilers have been moved outside the building to facilitate new floor construction.\n\n6. A new sump pit with sump pump to keep boiler room drained, appears necessary.\n\n7. New batteries were requested in Mr. Waite's report of February 26th, 1945, but no action to date has been taken.\n\n8. The Heating system does not function satisfactorily.\n\nY. M.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Pine Creek Recreation Center.\n\nOn your last visit to Camperville, I have brought to your attention the project of building a recreation and training center for our ex-pupils. We have already submitted a plan of building to the Department through our representative at Ottawa, Rev. Father O. Plourde, O.M.I.; 100' X 35' X 16' made of Cement blocks. We have added since to the plan presented a full basement. Part of the building will be an amusement center the other part a training center for both boys and girls.\n\nThe following list of material has been produced with the plan:\n\n- 138 pieces 2\" x 6\" x 22' spruce for rafters.\n- 138 \" 2\" x 4\" x 22' \" \" \"\n- 5500 sq. ft. 1\" x 10\" x 12' spruce shiplap, for roofing.\n- 5400 sq. ft. 1\" x 4\" x 12' spruce Vjoint for ceiling.\n- 4480 sq. ft. asphalt shingles.\n- 40 rolls of building paper, insulation of roof.\n- 40 pieces 2\" x 12\" x 10' fir, window frames.\n- 10 pieces 2\" x 12\" x 14' fir, doors frames.\n- 45 pieces 2\" x 12\" x 12' plates.\n- 600 ft. 1\" x 6\" x 12' fir trimmings.\n- 800 sacks of Cement.\n- 100 sacks of pebble lime.\n- 38 ft. chimney flues.\n- 2 kegs finishing nails 2 1/2\".\n- 10 rolls of wire for forms.\n- 50 pieces 2\" x 10\" x 12' spruce for scaffolding.\n- 50 pieces 2\" x 4\" x 12' \" \" \"\n- 500 sq. ft. 1\" x 8\" x 16' \" \" \"\n\nThe windows and doors we hope will be obtained from the War Assets Corporation at reasonable price. We have already made some 750 blocks but actually we are stopped due to the restriction on Cement.\nNow Mr. Ab. Sanoffski is offering us 5500 sq ft. of No. 1 Spruce shiplap at $60.00 per Mf. F.O.B. Camperville. At that price we are at least saving the transportation. Would you kindly interest the Department into this offer and obtain authorization to place the order with Mr. Ab. Sanoffski immediately. We intend to build as soon as possible, this Fall if we can get material.\n\nWe are purchasing material according to our means, and I feel sure that with the co-operation of the Department it will be possible to realize our plans in a very near future.\n\nYou have many a time mentioned that a recreation center as well as a training center would be a wonderful help to keep the influence of the school upon our ex-pupils.

(RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 8)\nOttawa, August 16, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to recent letters received from you in connection with the Pine Creek Residential School, I wish to supply the following information:\n\n1. Your letter of July 15, regarding the boilers -\n\nArrangements have been made to have a representative of the Surveys and Engineering Branch visit the school. At the present time we understand that it will require an expenditure of approximately $1,000.00 for labour and in addition we will have to purchase a new boiler. We may have considerable difficulty in securing this, and even if we do obtain it, it will involve a large expenditure.\n\n2. Your letter of July 24 with reference to the project of building a Recreational and Training Centre for Ex-pupils.\n\nI regret that in view of the very heavy expenditures that we have to make at this school, as outlined above, it will not be possible to consider making any expenditure on this building during the current fiscal year.\n\n3. Your letter of July 24, regarding high pressure boiler -\n\nYou may purchase 2000 additional bricks if you consider that these are required.\n\n4. Your letter of July 24, regarding the nightwatchman's services - It was never our intention to pay the full amount. We have only made a grant towards the night\nwatchman's salary. Due to the many demands on our appropriation this year, it is not possible to increase the amount previously allowed at the Pine Creek School for this service.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAug. 19, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville - Manitoba.\n\nIn connection with your memorandum of July 26th, 1946 in which you approved of an inspection of the above by our Mr. Hergreaves, you are advised as follows:\n\nA complete inspection of the Plumbing, Heating, Domestic Hot Water and Laundry Services was carried out on August 7th, 8th and 9th, 1946 and the following report outlines the conditions.\n\nIn the first place, the 2 low pressure heating boilers had been disconnected, dismantled and moved to the yard and a new concrete floor slab laid in the boiler room. This new work seems to be satisfactory and the seepage seems to have been localized into one corner of the building, where a pit has been left. Some type of sump pump will be required to dispose of the water which will be dealt with later in this report.\n\nThe high pressure boiler also has been dismantled and disconnected and is stored in the laundry, pending alterations to the space wherein it is to be set up. The brick settings for all 3 boilers have of course, also been torn down and this material is of very little, if any, further use. It is pointed out at this stage that the low pressure boilers are located in the extreme north end of the original school buildings, while the high pressure boiler is located in an added wing in the east side of the building or Service Wing. No fault is to be found with either of these locations.\n\nThe Provincial Boiler Inspector in his reports dated June 5th and June 14th has approved of a 100 lb. operating pressure for the high pressure boiler. This appears to be in order. He has condemned one low pressure heating boiler and called for a complete re-fit of the other one before it can be used again. Actually, both low pressure boilers are in such poor condition that they should be thrown away if repairs were attempted and it is strongly recommended that this Service accept no responsibility if repairs are ordered.\n\nAs regards heating, the school is in a state of dire emergency and a telegram was dispatched to the Chief Engineer of Engineering and Construction Service, asking for authority to institute immediate action to cover temporarily, the heating requirements. Authority having been granted, up to the sum of $1000.00 a steamfitter, Mr. Frank Rumstead, of Dauphin, Manitoba, was called in and asked to begin work immediately, as outlined below.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nContinuing with the report, it was found, as mentioned above, that the radiators are all too small. Evidently the job was originally calculated for too small a temperature range and the design was not consistent with good practice. This building should have been figured from 30\u00b0 below zero outside to 70\u00b0 inside.\n\nAs it is a one pipe system, most of the radiators can have sections added if matching patterns are obtainable. Otherwise, new additional radiators can be connected. The main appears to be satisfactory for the most part but some adjustment is necessary.\n\nThe Domestic Hot Water system needs a new jacket heater. The present unit is worn-out and ready for collapse. A new unit is strongly recommended.\n\nThe plumbing is in very bad condition throughout. Lead waste pipe, installed many years ago, is in very bad shape, being taped and repaired in many places. No traps are provided on individual basins in the dormitories and the venting is poorly arranged.\n\nOnly ingenious maintenance, brought about under almost hopeless conditions, has kept the system in operation and it is evident that a major breakdown is not far distant.\n\nThe ceiling over the top floor should be insulated. The roof should be re-shingled. Many leaks were noted.\n\nSummarizing, it is recommended that the following work be done:\n\nAs pointed out before, the heating boiler must be purchased and installed at the very earliest moment and too much stress cannot be placed on the serious results that will certainly occur if this boiler is not provided.\n\nThe following work should be undertaken at an early date:\n(a) Provide enough new radiators or sections to properly heat the building.\n(b) Make necessary adjustments to the piping. This can be kept to a reasonable minimum.\n(c) All plumbing fixtures to be provided with individual traps where such are missing and new wrought iron waste pipe and new wrought iron or cast iron vent pipe installed.\n(d) A new shingle roof is required and where sheathing and tar paper has deteriorated, replacements to be provided.\n(e) Windows to be checked and made tight. It is felt that this item can be handled by the school staff.\n(f) One new jacket heater required.\n(g) A list of small items which the school staff could undertake to be made out for their guidance.\n\nIt is estimated that in addition to the authorized cost of the emergency heating hook-up amounting to approximately $1000.00, the cost of installing a new low pressure heating boiler with attendant installation cost and repairs to the building, including additional redistillation, piping and plumbing revisions, will cost in the neighbourhood of $8500.00.\n\nT.S.

The high pressure boiler can supply only 65% of the proper load for the present inadequate radiation. This existing radiation is only about 50% of the surface needed to heat the school properly.\n\nIt will also be noted that the additional repairs and renewals are estimated to cost $8,500 and that immediate steps should be taken to purchase a new heating boiler of the type referred to in the last paragraph of page 2 of Mr. Mills' memorandum of August 19th.\n\nKindly advise of your wishes in this matter and the amount of funds that will be available for the project.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1946     | August 1 To Repairs to boilers at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School as per account attached | $2.00  |\n\nCode: 76-10-691\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Hesey,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur representative called at the Pine Creek Indian School at Camperville, to check the battery and reports as follows.\n\nType GEL 56-cell, 110-volt 180 Ampere Hour Globelite battery, Serial No.10145, purchased in April, 1941, groups spreading and positive plates breaking away from group; considerable sediment in the bottom of the jars; recommend replacement in the course of six months.\n\nThe battery is too small for the work required of it and it is our suggestion that it should be replaced by a much larger capacity battery and as a minimum our type WL7 110-volt 350 Ampere Hour battery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED\n\nSales Manager.\n\nWESTERN CANADA'S LARGEST BATTERY MANUFACTURERS\nOttawa, August 30, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Manitoba.\n\nI have your memorandum of August 23, with reference to the above, and note that you estimate the cost of installing a new low pressure heating boiler, with attendant installation cost and also the repairs to the building, including additional radiation, piping, etc., at approximately $8,500.00.\n\nSubsequent to the receipt of your memorandum, Mr. Buck phoned the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, and during the course of the conversation we ascertained that to supply the new heating boiler that is required and to install same would involve a cost of about $4,000.00. Mr. Buck was informed that we could find this amount but that the other repairs required would have to wait until next year.\n\nMr. Buck then stated that your Branch had made enquiries with regard to a new heating boiler and that you had been informed it would be approximately seven months before this could be secured.\n\nAs you know, our residential schools are due to open early in September, and if a new boiler cannot be obtained it would involve closing this school for practically the whole of 1946-47.\n\nSubsequently we phoned Reverend M. Lavigne, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, under whose jurisdiction this...\nschool is operated, and informed him of the condition that had arisen. We asked him if he knew of any place where a boiler could be secured.\n\nOn the afternoon of August 29 Father Lavigne phoned from St. Boniface to say that he had been in touch with the Port Arthur Shipbuilding and Boiler Company, Port Arthur, Ontario, and that they had informed him they could build the boiler required within four weeks.\n\nI would therefore appreciate it if you would let me have immediate specifications for the boiler that is needed, in order that we may have the Departmental Purchasing Agent endeavour to secure it.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Manitoba.\n\nIn connection with your memorandum of August 30, 1946, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe are enclosing four copies of a specification for the new heating boiler for the above for the use of the Departmental Purchasing Agent. The Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company, Limited, mentioned in your memorandum, make the unit we have described, and we consider it advisable to have them deliver the boiler to the school.\n\nWe might point out that the nearest railway stations C. N. R. are at Winnipegosis and Pine Creek, Manitoba, and that these points are approximately 35 miles from Camperville.\n\nWe recommend that Indian Affairs Branch advise Reverend Principal Ruest to make arrangements with F. W. Bumstead, steamfitter, to install the boiler, in accordance with drawings and instructions which will be prepared by this Service.\n\nWhen the order is accepted by the boiler manufacturer, we should have 3 prints of shop drawings forwarded to us in order that we may make a foundation drawing for its erection.\n\nMr. Bumstead should also be authorized by the Reverend Principal to arrange for the condensation pump and receiver as discussed with our Mr. Hargreaves on his recent inspection trip.\n\nWe also suggest that all accounts should be certified by the Indian Agent and forwarded to Indian Affairs, Ottawa, for payment.\n\nR.

He claims he could obtain all the dimension and rough lumber this winter, at prices considerably lower than those being charged by lumber merchants, at a local mill. He further stated that he no doubt could have the lumber cut to size. He would require a barn to stable approximately 30 head of cattle and 8 horses.\n\nI requested that he forward a plan of the barn and the matter would again be taken up with the Department.\n\nHe further stated that there is no heat in the school and that the temperature in the school was below 45 degrees. If this condition lasts for any length of time, I beg to suggest that the children be returned to their homes, until such time as the boiler for heating has been received and set up.\n\nWill you please advise concerning the latter paragraph.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please inform the Principal of the Pine Creek School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\nENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICE\n\nSpecification for the Installation of\nNew Low Pressure Steam Heating Boiler,\nPINE CREEK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n1. SCOPE OF WORK:\nThis specification and the accompanying plan are intended to provide for the installation and connecting up of a new low pressure steam heating boiler at the above. The Contractor shall take all measurements at the building, set out all work and be responsible for the quality of same. Except for the boiler, which will be delivered to the job by others, he shall provide all labor, transportation, material and plant and shall give his personal and constant attention to the work and be responsible for any damage done to other work, incidental to the execution of his own.\n\n2. VISIT THE SITE:\nThe Contractor shall visit the site and thoroughly acquaint himself with the conditions under which the work will be done and govern himself accordingly.\n\n3. MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP:\nAll materials shall be new, except as hereinafter noted, and the best of their respective kinds, sound and free from defects.\n\nWorkmanship shall be of the best and all work shall be done in a neat manner, with due attention given to the grading of pipes and making connections. All connections shall be made so as to permit free and unobstructed flow at all times and adequate provision shall be made for expansion.\n\n4. VALVES:\nAll valves shall be gate valves, 2\" and under, all brass; over 2\" iron body, bronze fitted, or an approved type.\n\nThe Contractor shall examine the existing valves which were formerly in use in the boiler room, and if any valves of the proper sizes are found fit for service, he may, at his discretion, and with the approval of the Principal, use same after having thoroughly cleaned and repacked valves where necessary. If any old valves are used, they must be refitted so that they will be equal to the demands of service.\n5. Drip Traps:\n\nThe low pressure header in boiler room shall be dripped through a 3/4\" float and thermostatic trap, complete with valves, strainer, unions, scale pocket, etc., to ensure complete and rapid elimination of the condensation.\n\n6. Piping:\n\nAll steam and return piping shall be standard weight black steel pipe put together with cast iron screwed fittings, or flanged where required. All pipe shall be carefully reamed before assembly and pipe compound shall be applied to pipe threads only.\n\nPiping shall be run substantially as shown on plans, with swing joints to compensate for expansion where indicated or required and tested to 100 p.s.i. before covering is applied.\n\nAlternatively, pipe may be welded, using approved welding fittings, and conforming with the best pipe welding practice, but if welding is contemplated, this must be so stated by the Contractor. Sufficient flanged connections or unions shall be left for convenient assembly and dismantling for repair and cleaning. Welding shall be done only by recognised skilled pipe line welders, and satisfactory evidence of the skill and experience of each welder employed shall be submitted to the Chief Engineer, Engineering Construction Service, Department of Mines and Energy, his accredited representative, for approval before work is commenced.\n\n7. Hangers:\n\nThe low pressure header shall be supported by means of adjustable ring type hangers on 3/8\" pipe, spaced to ceiling and spaced equi-distant on not more than 24\" centres.\n\nAny brackets used shall be spaced not more than 8'-0\" apart on the smaller lines.\n\n8. Covering:\n\nAll steam mains shall be covered with asbestos air cell sectional pipe covering, carried down and fitted around hangers, where such occur, and fitted around elbows, tees, valves, etc., and be covered with long fibre asbestos cement and cotton, as specified for pipes. Flanges and unions shall not be covered, nor return mains, unless so noted.\n\nBoiler shall be covered 1\" thick with 4\" mesh firebrick blocks wired in place, and plastered 1\" deep with long fibre asbestos cement, applied in 2 coats, the second coat to be tempered with 10% Portland cement and allowed to dry to a smooth finish. Paint 2 coats with heat resisting waterproof paint of an approved colour. Colour to be approved by the Reverend Principal.\nOctober 29th, 1946.\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville - Manitoba.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of October 22nd, 1946, in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe are in receipt of the manufacturer's shop drawings outlining the characteristics of the new low pressure steam heating boiler for the above, and have also received a wire from Frank Bumstead, Steamfitter, stating he has now obtained a condensation pump.\n\nThe above information has been acted on and we have prepared a plan and specification covering the operations involved in connecting this equipment to the existing heating system.\n\nIt is our belief that, owing to the nature of the work involved, and in consideration of the measures taken to provide temporary heat, Indian Affairs would be well advised to arrange for this work to be carried out by F. W.

Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 2, 1946.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe received your telegram of October 22nd, in which you stated that you expect to ship the boiler for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School Camperville, Manitoba about November 6th.\n\nWe appreciate the co-operation you have given us in manufacturing this boiler and we trust that you will be able to ship it on the date mentioned above. This boiler is intended for one of our Residential Schools and at the present time the existing radiation is at least fifty percent low. If the weather becomes extreme before the boiler is installed it may be necessary to send the children home, which would involve considerable inconvenience to the Indian children concerned.\n\nAs soon as the boiler is shipped, it would be appreciated if you would telegraph Mr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, so that he can give any assistance possible in having the boiler delivered from the railway station to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

This brickwork was only recently finished and it is badly cracked in several places.\n\nWill you kindly look into this matter as soon as possible and advise when it has been satisfactorily repaired.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. F.W. Bumstead,\nSteamfitter,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThe Pine Creek school is badly in need of a new roof, and I would request that an amount of $3,000 (three thousand dollars) be placed in estimates 1947/48 for the purpose of renewing the old school building. I understand that the department engineer, Mr Hargrave has made a report to the Department on the roof, and the information will probably be found in his report.\n\nThe wash bowls in both the girls and boys dormitories are connected in series of 4/5/6 bowls. Only one trap is fitted to each series of bowls. In all there are fifty two fittings, and a trap for each bowl should be installed. Under present conditions if one bowl becomes blocked the whole series is out of commission and considerable work is entailed in the cleaning of the one trap. I have asked the Reverend Principal to have Mr Bumstead furnish a price for new fittings, and as soon as this is received a report will be forwarded to the department.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 4 December 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ultimo requesting that $3,000.00 be provided in the estimates for 1947-48 for the purpose of renewing the old roof on the Pine Creek School.\n\nOur estimates for the next fiscal year have already been submitted. However, your recommendation will be kept in mind and you should write to us again about the matter in April or May next at which time we will be in a position to decide if funds can be provided.\n\nIn regard to the second paragraph of your letter, we will not make any decision until we hear further from you. In view of the very heavy expenditure that we have had to incur at this school during the past few months, we were hoping that it would not be necessary to spend any additional large amount during the balance of the current fiscal year.\n\nBernard V.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to report that our New Boiler has been temporary installed on the Church heating system for Xmas. The complete installation has been impossible, lack of material. We are still heating the school with our high pressure boiler. Mr. Bunstead expect to complete work immediately after New Year's Day.\n\nThe New boiler has been operating two days and two nights, it is working perfectly.\n\nAs you know the return water is pumped back in the boiler by an automatic condensation pump operated by a one H.P. electric motor.\n\nAs I have already pointed out and as you have already reported to the Department our actual set of batteries are very well done. So well done that it would be unsafe to depend on same to operate the motor of the new boiler. This motor failing would cause the ruin of the boiler. While heating with the new boiler we have kept the Diesel engine running so that there would be enough juice in the batteries to take care of them after operating the pump. You know that it is impossible to run this Diesel engine day and night for the rest of the Winter.\n\nMay I also point out that we have had trouble on Xmas day with our high pressure boiler; a flue has been leaking. For a while we were in serious trouble, but we manage to repair the flue without further damage.\n\nNo heat during four long hours and a terrible cold wind outside. The school was near freezing point when we were ready to start fire again.\n\nThis shows that we are really in need of the new boiler at most and in absolute need of a new set of batteries to operate same. It is urgent.\n\nOn August 22, 1946 Mr. Jack Cooper, Inspector of the Globelite Co., has inspected our batteries. The following is his recommendation: \"When batteries replaced they shall be Type W 21 or G 19 for 40 amp discharge. This shows that the actual batteries are way too small for the work to be done, specially with one more motor to increase the load.\n\nWhen a new set is installed ask the Company who will supply same to send a man to see that the Installation, connection, etc. are done properly.\n\nKindly give your immediate attention to this serious matter, it is urgent, may I once again insist on the recommendation done by Mr. Cooper for a larger set of batteries.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School, relative to certain requests for new batteries, and a new high pressure boiler.\n\nThe report is self explanatory and deals with requests made in previous reports.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\n126-1-5\n\n18 January 1947\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nJanuary 24, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing the conversation we have had with Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector and yourself, Re: alteration to be done to our sewing room, namely removing one wall and cupboard in order to give more room; the following material will be needed:\n\n500 sq. ft. 1\" X 10\" X 12' Spruce lumber.\n500 sq. ft. 1\" X 6\" X 12' Fir.\n300 sq. ft. V-joint 1\" X 4\" X 12' fir if possible, if not spruce.\n200 linel ft. quarter round 3/4\"\n2 sheet three ply wood 1/4\" X 4' X 12'\n1 length of black iron pipe 3\" X 20' to support ceiling.\nLabor on taking actual wall down, patching main walls, buildin' new cupboards approximately $150.00\n\nPlease kindly obtain for us authorization to get material and do the work as soon as possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose an estimate of material and labour, submitted by Rev. Fr. C. Ruest, O.M.I., Principal, Pine Creek Residential School, for the enlarging of the sewing room at the school.\n\nAt the present time the room is far too small for the purpose required. On the north side the wall is composed of cupboards four feet in depth. The room adjoining the south wall is composed of cupboards, which means that the partition between the two rooms is eight feet wide, composed of cupboards.\n\nDuring the visit of Mr. Inspector Hamilton and myself to the school, the matter was brought to our attention, and the suggestion recommended. The removal of these cupboards would make the sewing room a useful size and considerably brighter. The room at present is far too small. The enlarging of the room would allow cupboards, already built on the north wall to be used for the storage of sewing materials. These would not be sufficient for that purpose and it is proposed to build new cupboards on the west wall between windows, and on the east wall, where they would be out of the way.\n\nI beg to recommend that this improvement be carried out.\n\nJ. Weite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 18th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th inst., with reference to enlarging the sewing room at the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nIt has been decided to authorize the expenditure and the Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure the material. It is noted that the cost of the labour will not exceed $150.00.\n\nThe Principal of the Pine Creek School should keep in mind the fact that we have been under very heavy expense at this school during the current fiscal year and consequently we feel that we will not be able to make any further expenditures during the balance of the current fiscal year.\n\nI wish also to draw your attention to official letter of January 21st. We have not yet received any reply to that letter giving the information required about the high pressure boiler.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nFebruary 12, 1947.\n\nMr. J.

Length of boiler 10 ft. Diameter 36\". H.P. 25, Pressure 100 lbs. Now a new set of tubes will be needed for this boiler, as already reported.\n\n20 tubes 3 in. diam. outside measure and 10 ft. long:\n1 only Roller tube expander for tubes 3 in. Prices $18.00\n1 only Beading tool 8 in. long. ....... Price $1.50\n1 only tube cleaner type combination....... Price $3.75\n\nThis set of tubes and the three above mentioned tools should be placed on order immediately so that we may replace these tubes during the next Summer Holidays.\n\nIt may occurred that you mentioned High Pressure Boiler and had in mind Jacket heater; if so here are the specifications:\n\nThe actual jacket heater is a Gurney No. 104-4253 has been installed in 1929. Length 64 in.; width 28 in.; height 50 in. Water inlet and outlet 2 1/2 in. Smoke stack 9 in. Hot water tank size: 12 ft. long, 36 in. diameter.\n\nWe have no catalogue number, probably the actual Jacket heater has been supplied through the J. H. Ashdown-Hardware Co., Winnipeg. Probably the mentioned Company may be in position to supply the needed Jacket heater.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

Rumstead of Dauphin, Manitoba amounting to $2,295.30 is acknowledged.\n\nThe accounts have been certified by the school principal and after a close check, we are prepared to recommend them for payment.\n\nThe Principal, however, has drawn attention to a fault that has appeared in the new boiler setting to which Rumstead has already made repairs. However one of the considerations applying to this project was that before the work was accepted by the Department, and final payment made, an inspection would be carried out and a report submitted.\n\nWe have already written Mr. Gow to arrange for the inspection as soon as possible and have instructed him to give Rumstead any instructions that may arise therefrom. Mr. Hargreaves, when recently in Winnipeg discussed this job with Mr. Gow, and was informed that until road conditions improved, it would be impossible to reach the school. It is unlikely therefore that we will receive Mr. Gow's report before the first of May.\n\nIt is understood however that Indian Affairs are prepared to make a payment of $1,200.00 on this account now, and final payment when any corrections arising out of Mr. Gow's inspection have been carried out.\n\nBoth copies of the account which were forwarded by Mr. Hoey, are returned herewith for their further action.\n\n(Sgd.)

Doors do not remain closed. The top is leaking badly. The engine is pinging and leaking oil. Front wheel bearings are worn out. The complete steering equipment is loosed and worn out so badly that it is unsafe to put such truck in circulation. The speedometer indicates a mileage of 65,158 miles. The truck has operated since date of purchase, October 1939. Considering the condition of roads over which it has operated we may be satisfy to see that it stood up so long.\n\nUntil now the Department has favored us with mean of transportation, due to the fact that our school is situated 35v miles away from the nearest Hospital and railway station.\n\nI am kindly asking the Department to exchange the old truck for a new one, as the old one is not worth repairing.\n\nThe General Motor Co. and the Dominion Motor Co. are offering a Station Wagon, 1/2 ton truck, steel body, at an approximate price of $1735.00. Probably the sum of $500.00 would be allowed on the old truck. These figures are given approximately.\n\nPlease kindly present this request to the Department. It is urgent, mean of transportation is needed to take children home by the end of next Month for Summer Holidays.\n\nIf a new truck cannot be obtain before Summer Holidays, I will be force to hire the Camperville Taxi, operating a Jeep Station Wagon, to take children home, the expenses will as follow:\n\n1 trip to Winnipegosisis ........................................... 7.00\nWinnipegosisis to Skownan by boat ......................... 10.00\n1 trip to Bradberry Via Mafeking, 306 miles .............. 30.00\nFrom Bradberry to Shoal River by boat .................. 20.00\n1 trip to Rolling River & Gamb Lizard Pt.

No reply has been received to date. Please advise.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nJune 7, 1947.\n\nRe: Pine Cree Indian Residential School,\nGamberville - Manitoba.\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum dated May 29th, to which is attached Mr. Rose's inspection report, along with the Contractor's guarantee covering materials and workmanship.\n\nWhen our Mr. Hargreaves visited the school, the heating boilers had been removed and the high pressure boiler had been dismantled, as you will no doubt recall. Since the heating boilers were deemed unfit for further service, and owing to the lateness of the season, it was considered advisable to authorize the immediate setting up of the high pressure boiler, and to make temporary connections to the heating mains until such time as a new heating boiler could be procured and installed.\n\nActing on this authority, Mr. Bustead was instructed to carry out the work and to employ competent brick setters to enclose the high pressure boiler. Mr. Hargreaves met the brick setters and having previously investigated their record, which included over 100 such installations, thoroughly discussed the installation with them, leaving a sketch covering the essential requirements. Mr. Bustead was given to understand that he was to be the general contractor and the only organization with which the Department would deal. A drawing was supplied, on which the necessary specifications were noted.\n\nThe school operating staff was repeatedly advised not to start off with a roaring fire, but rather, to carry small fires for several days until the brickwork was thoroughly dried out, which is always the procedure to be followed in such installations.\n\nMr. Rose intimates in the last paragraph of his report, that the instructions issued at that time were evidently disregarded, and that too heavy a fire was started initially, which in our opinion would certainly cause such cracks to appear. Under the circumstances, and in view of the very good reputation of the contractors concerned, we are not inclined to hold them responsible for the cracks.\n\nHowever, before the work is accepted for final payment, the cracks to which Mr. Rose has drawn attention, should be well packed, using asbestos rope and plastic asbestos cement as required, and we would request that you issue the necessary instructions to Mr. Bustead, and assign one of your engineers as soon as possible to make a final inspection before a fire is started.\n\nHe should be authorized to instruct the school authorities to start a slow drying out fire and maintain this for several days, pointing out to them that they are not free of this responsibility.\n\n(Sgd) T.S.

If so, the account will be certified by our officer and forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nEncl.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

In fact we are advised that they are not even receiving answers to their tenders.\n\nIt has been suggested that a Willys jeep station wagon might be sufficiently large and powerful to serve the needs of this school. Would you please advise us as to whether such a station wagon would be acceptable. It must be clearly understood that this does not mean that such a station wagon will be provided, as they are of American make and rather difficult to have authority obtained for their purchase through the Treasury Board.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

A 1939 Pontiac Station Wagon was to be traded in on this deal. We informed you at that time that the Ford Motor Company of Canada Ltd were not manufacturing Station Wagons and therefore could not make a tender.\n\nThis morning the principal of the Indian School requested that we write you to the effect that they would prefer a Ford one Ton Express Truck. We believe that we could supply with one of these from four to eight weeks time.\n\nWe would be pleased to receive from you regular forms for completing the tender on the above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAllard & Dicks Motors.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We believe that we could supply with one of these from four to eight weeks time.\"\n\nCould we please be advised by return air mail whether you are willing to accept a Ford one ton express truck in place of a station wagon, as stated in the above letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It would seem that the Principal has expressed a preference for a Ford one ton express truck. Therefore, would you drop all enquiries with regard to the provision of a station wagon at this school while we communicate with the Principal to ascertain if this is his desire.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering your letter of the 1st instant, Re: Station Wagon for our Pine Creek School, I wish to inform you that the Willys Jeep Station Wagon would meet our needs for the time being, although my humble opinion is that the Jeep Station Wagon will not stand what the other models would. I may be wrong.\n\nI have been at the Consolidated Motors Co., Winnipeg, this morning I am informed that the Company could supply us with a Station Wagon immediately, Price complete $2450.00. The same company could also supply one (1) ton truck, which could be accommodated to meet our needs; Price $1769.00.\n\nThe same Company would give approximately $300.00 in exchange on our old Pontiac Station Wagon. The estimates on the old machine are given on my verbal description of the conditions of the said Pontiac. The dealer has not seen the Wagon and consequently can only give approximate figures on what our old machine is worth in exchange on a new.\n\nEither the Station Wagon or the one ton truck would meet our actual needs. The Station Wagon is a better looking and more comfortable machine. The truck is of larger capacity and a more powerful machine.\n\nI hope it would be possible to obtain a new mean of transportation before the 26th of the present month, so that I may have same to take the children back to school.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

In your letter of August 12th you state that a one ton truck would meet your actual needs. By this do you mean a one ton express truck or panel truck?\n\nAs the Jeep station wagon is made in the United States, authority for its purchase is rather difficult to obtain. However, we can obtain a panel truck or an express truck if you will state your preference. I may also add that an express truck is easier to obtain than a panel truck.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C.

But if I have to wait two months before delivery of same I will be two months without a mean of transportation.\n\nI have already reported that a Jeep Station wagon or a Jeep one ton truck could be supplied immediately by the Consolidated Motors Co. at Winnipeg.\n\nThe best mean of transportation for us would be a One ton truck Jeep four wheels drive which will cost approximately $2000.00.\n\nI am prepared to accept any truck 1/2 or 3/4 or 1 ton, or a Jeep Station Wagon, because our needs are urgent.\n\nThe best as already mentioned would a four wheel drive truck capacity one ton.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI windily find enclosed estimate on material and equipment needed to put up a new barn according to the enclosed sketch. Kindly note that all articles listed are quoted F.O.R. Winnipeg. Probably some $700.00 will have to be added for transportation on material. An other $200.00 for installation of electricity.\n\nThe gravel is quoted but will be supply by Mr. J. Desrocher or an other local truck driver, at prices quoted.\n\nWe will have to tear the old barn down to build the new one on the same spot, reasons: water and electric lines and sewer. If we built at another location a new waterline will have to be installed which I estimate will cost about the same as tearing the old building down. I am not in a position to estimate the expenses for tearing down and cleaning the old place. Work could be done by the Indians at the rate of .40 per hour. It may cost some $800.00 or more.\n\nLabour on new construction will have to be added to the enclosed estimates. I am inform that it will amount to about $3000.00\n\nMay I suggest that the order for material and equipment be given as soon as possible, so that all material be shipped on time for transportation during Winter fishing season.\n\nNext Spring the new building could completed early, so that we may store our hay supply in the new feed shed.\n\nThe Manager of the Cusson Lumber Co. guarantees that if the order is placed early this Fall, his Company could delivered all material needed during the Winter months.\n\nI am sorry that I could not obtained these quotations any sooner.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nG. Ruest, O.M.T.\nPrincipal.\nPortage la Prairie\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-1-5 (W.T.l), October 22, 1946.\n\nReferring to the above noted letter, I beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal, Pine Creek School, together with bill of material submitted by The Cusson Lumber Company, and prices for stalls, stanchions etc., submitted by Beatty Bros., and a plan of the ground floor of a barn.\n\nThe letter is self explanatory. It would appear from the bill of material, that a one storey barn is planned, with a feed room attached. This would seem an expensive type of building. It would seem that the barn proper is 60 X 34, with a twelve feet stud. The feed room adjoining would be 50 X 30, also with twelve feet studs. The cost would be approximately $10,000.00.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 18th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant enclosing communication from the principal of the Pine Creek School with reference to the erection of a new barn. It is noted that the expenditure involved would be approximately $8,000. No funds for this purpose were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation, and consequently it is not possible for us to authorize the expenditure.\n\nI infer from the last paragraph of your letter that you do not approve the type of barn suggested by the principal. I would appreciate it if you would consult him again on the matter with a view to ascertaining if a barn suitable for their purposes could be constructed at less cost. If so you should let me know as soon as possible, giving an estimate in order that we can consider the matter when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nWe will likely have to submit this to the Minister's office before the end of October and consequently we will require an answer before that time.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nIndian Affairs.

September 18, 1947.\n\nIn reply to the above noted letter, I beg to advise that the Reverend Principal of the Pine Creek School was consulted this date in connection with the proposed barn for the school. With him was a lumber merchant from Duck Bay, which is in the vicinity of the school. The proposal that the barn be constructed with a loft instead of a feed shed did not meet with favour. The material for the barn, proposed by the Principal, is all 2 X 4 dimension. The feed shed is the same. To put on a loft, heavier material would be required, and the cost would be approximately the same. The feed shed, as proposed, is possibly more suitable for the district, as no moisture from the barn can penetrate and spoil feed. It would be possible to use local lumber, and a saving of between $500.00 and $600.00 effected. The lumber dealer, accompanying the Principal, stated that rough lumber was selling at $50.00 per M., and would cost $2.00 per M., delivered at the site. For the siding and inside shiplap, the rough lumber would have to be taken to a planer, situated at Winnipegosis. The cost of making siding and shiplap would be $8.00 per M., plus $4.00 per M. freighting. This would mean that the siding and shiplap could be delivered at the building site for $62.00 per M. Rough lumber could be used for the dimension and sheeting. This would mean that only shingles, nails, windows, paper, hardware and doors would have to be shipped in. The lumberman suggested that the order be placed as soon as possible so that the 6 X 6 needed in the construction could be cut this winter. The Principal figured\non using three 2 X 6, laminated, for beams. The cutting of 6 X 6 would be a saving in labour and material.\n\nThe suggested barn is only of a size to accommodate the following stock. Six horses, sixteen cows, a calf pen and a bull pen.\n\nThe prices quoted to the Department for material were from a lumber yard in Winnipeg.\n\nIf it is intended to build the barn next summer, the gravel for the foundation should be hauled before freeze-up this fall. If allowed this fall, I beg to request that I be advised immediately, just now trucks are not busy. In a month's time all available trucks will be on the fish haul. If not hauled this fall no building can be done next summer, as it will be June before the gravel pit will thaw enough to allow digging.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant with further reference to the erection of a new barn at the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nAt the present time the Department is not in a position to state definitely if it will be possible to provide funds for the erection of a new barn at this school during the summer of 1948. We will have many demands from various parts of the country and we are not yet aware of the total amount of funds that will be placed at our disposal.\n\nWith the above in mind you may purchase the gravel at a cost of $337.50 but it must be distinctly understood by the principal of the Pine Creek School that in authorizing the purchase of the gravel, the Department does not commit itself to providing funds for the erection of a new barn next year.\n\nIn surveying the correspondence in connection with this matter, it is noted that in neither your letter of September 9th nor October 1st do you express a definite opinion regarding the necessity for a new barn at the Pine Creek School.\n\nWe would like to know the size of the barn at present at the school and its condition.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, October 7, 1947.\n\nDear Father Ruest:\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th ultimo with reference to purchase order 13494.

May I suggest that while repairing the roof it would be also necessary to repair both dormitories. We have often pointed out that both dormitories are cold; lack of insulation, both should be insulated. Leakage of the roof has caused considerable damage to both ceilings. Also the wash bowls fittings and connections are completely done and will have to be renewed.\n\nAlthough I am not an expert in estimation, I would say that the above mentioned sum will not be sufficient to do such essential and substantial work. I would suggest that at least another $2000.00 be placed in estimates for that purpose.\n\nThe actual roof leaks like a basket, causing plater to fall from the ceilings.\n\nCould a contractor inspect our roof and give a complete list of material needed so that it may be purchased as soon as possible to ensure possibility of doing the work early next Spring. It must be done, the sooner the better.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nOctober 29, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn May 22, 1947, I reported that a Jacket Heater have been received from the Crane Limited. A couple months after we discover that the heater was received by mistake on the part of Crane. This article was to be shipped to an other party. The Company gave informations to the Camperville Freighters to ship the Jacket Heater to an other point.\n\nSo I am forced to bring back the question of purchasing a new Jacket Heater for our school.\n\nYou have already asked us by letter dated May 16, 1947, if the Jacket heater on which Vulcan Iron Works, had quoted prices would be satisfactory. It would not due to floor space, it is too wide. And a little short. We would like one approximately the same size as the old one, which is 65\" long, 50\" high and 30\" wide.\n\nPlease kindly give this matter your usual Attention.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nReport on Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nA one horse power motor is being used for pumping the return to the heating boiler. This motor makes a terrible drag on the batteries and a one quarter horse power motor would do the job satisfactorily. I would suggest that the one horse power motor and pump be kept, in case the smaller motor should break down. The breaking down of this unit would mean that the school would have to be closed until such time as the motor or pump could be repaired. This would mean a trip to Dauphin, approximately 100 miles. The unit required would be a 60 cycle motor, D.C. power 110, also one centrifical pump 7 lbs. pressure. The approximate cost of this unit $75.00.\n\nThe Reverend Principal claims the Lister engine, 10 H.P., is not powerful enough to charge the batteries and feels that a 20 H.P. engine should be provided. The batteries are sulphating to some extent and I beg to suggest that an electrical engineer from Munro-Edwards Ltd., Wall St., Winnipeg be instructed to visit the school and check the system. It is my opinion that there is a leak in the system and the present charge is not getting through to the batteries. The switch board was installed and built by the firm mentioned above.\n\nA new wood-shed has been built immediately adjoining the pressure boiler. In its present state it is dangerous. It is within a few feet of the boiler, and the wood wall has been exposed. I requested the Principal to purchase 7 pcs. of 4 X 10 and 5 pcs. of 4 X 8 galvanized No. 22 iron to cover the wall and the door jambs, which were also exposed. The account for the galvanized iron to be forwarded to the Department. I trust my action in this matter was in order. It would have immediately come to the attention of a fire inspector and some criticism result.\n\nThere were two washing machines at the school, both installed in 1929. One machine was in pieces and cannot be repaired. This means extra work and strain for the washer still in use. This machine is also about done. The Reverend Principal suggested that one large washing machine be installed in place of the two that are practically finished. A 42 X 54 manufactured by the Beaver Merit Washers, Beaver Laundry Machinery Co., Limited, Toronto. I might state that both the washers installed in 1929, were according to the Principal, second-hand at that time.\n\nI wish to refer to agency report dated November 28, 1946, and Department reply thereto, 126-105 (W.T.I.) of December 4th. My report refers especially to the condition of the roof and the wash bowls in both dormitories. Nothing has been done in either case. I would now suggest that some improvement be made to the dormitories. The whole roof down to the plate will have to be torn off and a new roof put on. At very little extra cost, a great improvement could be made to the dormitories, which are dark and depressing. I would suggest that the third storey, which consists of sheeting and shingles, lath and plastered inside, be entirely removed and re-built of brick or similar material. More and larger windows should be installed. The present windows are of the casement variety, giving very little light except in the immediate vicinity. All the frames and casements will have to be renewed in the very near future as\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthey are badly rotted. The ceiling of both dormitories are gradually breaking down, due to water leaking through the roof. This means that both ceilings will have to be renewed and possibly a lot of the lath will be found to be rotted. The condition of the ceiling in the girls' dormitory is dangerous, but I hesitate to insist that the Principal tear off the plaster. If the plaster were torn off, it would mean the ceiling would have to be insulated. A photograph of the school is attached hereto, showing the roof and the proposed new construction. I would suggest that a flat roof be built. However, this whole matter should be surveyed by an engineer. The cost of roofing the building will be high; the difference in the cost of the new construction would be the brickwork, instead of shingles. There is a lot of timber in the roof, in supports and braces that possible could be used in the new construction.\n\nThe fire escapes should also be a matter for consideration. Sliding poles are at present in use from the two upper floors. It seems terrible to contemplate children sliding down these poles in night attire, in 40 below Zero weather. And 40 below is quite common in the vicinity of Lake Winnipegos. I would strongly recommend that the chute fire escape be installed.\n\nThe new truck, recently purchased by the Department is standing outside, because of lack of garage space. The garage at present in use is of lumber construction and cannot be made fireproof. I would suggest a concrete garage sufficiently large to house all the cars at the school. This would mean a concrete structure, fire-proof, 24 X 24. This size was suggested by the Principal. The suggestion was that the building would be erected next to the fireproof boiler room. One wall of the boiler room would have to be raised three feet and would constitute one wall of the proposed garage. This again is a matter for consideration by an engineer.\n\nI beg to refer to Department letter 126-1-5 (W.T.L) of February 18th, last, in which I was advised that certain materials would be bought by the Purchasing Branch for the improvement of the sewing rooms. The material has not been received and I beg to request that the Principal be allowed to purchase locally.\n\nAttached hereto are a number of letters recently received from the Principal relative to other requisitions etc.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nference in the cost of the new construction would be the brickwork, instead of shingles. There is a lot of timber in the roof, in supports and braces that possibly could be used in the new construction.\n\n\"The fire escapes should also be a matter for consideration. Sliding poles are at present in use for the two upper floors. It seems terrible to contemplate children sliding down these poles in night attire, in 40 below Zero weather. And 40 below is quite common in the vicinity of Lake Winnipegosis. I would strongly recommend that the chute fire escape be installed.\"\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would have one of your engineers visit this school at his earliest convenience and submit a report regarding what he considers is necessary and also supply us with an estimate of the cost.\n\nAt the present time we cannot promise that we will have funds available in the current year's appropriation to do any extensive repairs, although we might find the money for minor repairs.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nNovember 19th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: File 30-39 New Barn at Pine Creek School.\n\nAnswering your letter of the 17th instant, I wish to inform that the actual barn building measures, 130 ft. long, 52 ft. wide and 16 ft. studding. Out of this 62' x 52' x 16' is the barn properly the rest is a feed shed, with an underground shelter for cattle.\n\nYou know the condition of the actual building, it is simply falling into pieces. Some 27 years ago it has been question of building a new one, since then mostly every fall considerable repair and patching has been done to the old building. It is terribly cold, water freezing even when full of cattle. The studdings are rotten at both ends, so are the joists. Above the barn there is a hay loft which collects all the moisture and dampness of the barn. The ceiling and floor are rotten so badly that we have to walk on the joists to prevent falling through. It is simply and completely done for.\n\nThere are only two alternatives, either build a new barn next summer or sell the stock next fall. Selling the stock in such a cold and damp barn is far from being a paying proposition, unfortunately I was forced to do it for the past 9 years.\n\nPlease kindly find from the Department what they wish me to do; either build a new barn next summer or sell the stock in the coming fall.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

I visited the reserve recently, and strongly recommend that a new barn be built at the school as soon as money is available. The building has sunk into the ground at least three feet, has a bad lean to the north and west, and from the information I was able to gather, is in the neighbourhood of fifty years old.\n\nJ.

Gow, Winnipeg, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"This Indian School is situated about twenty miles from the railway and is inaccessible by car during the winter months. Mr. Waite has suggested rebuilding of the roof, amongst many other things. I do not believe that an inspection at this time, with the roof covered with ice and snow, would give us information upon what we would require in order to outline roof alterations.\n\nFurthermore, in view of the isolated nature of the school, it would be impossible to carry out any repair work before the end of the present fiscal year or even to get any material to the site. We will arrange to discuss the situation with Mr. Waite and ascertain what arrangements, if any, can be made to visit the school at this time but we would strongly recommend that the inspection, for best results, should be postponed until spring.\"\n\nYou will note that Mr. Gow, for reasons stated strongly recommends that an inspection of the school should be postponed until the spring, and we concur in this recommendation.\n\nIf, however, after further discussion of the situation with Indian Agent Waite, Mr. Gow should offer any practical suggestion for carrying out necessary minor repairs during the present fiscal year, we will advise you accordingly.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nB.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, the principal answered our letter by stating that the jacket heater would be supplied and apparently we inferred at that time that the tubes were not necessary and consequently they were not ordered.\n\nThe quotation that we received from the Vulcan Iron Works shown in a letter forwarded to you on May 8th was as follows:\n\n28 only tubes, 3\" diameter outside measure, 10 ft. long $135.\n1 only boiler tube expander for 3\" tubes $40.\n1 only beading tool, 6\" long $9.\n1 only tube cleaner type of combination $11.\n\nTOTAL...........$195.\n\nI suggest that you communicate with Vulcan Iron Works, Sutherland Avenue, Winnipeg and ascertain if they can supply the tubes at the same price as quoted last year. If not, you should obtain their price and submit same to us by air mail and we will arrange to have a purchase order issued.\nWith reference to your second letter of March 4th, the Department does not supply cups, saucers, plates, etc., to Indian residential schools. If these articles can be obtained from the War Assets Corporation, the school should communicate with the Branch of War Assets Corporation from whom the quotation was secured and make the purchase direct.

Waite, Superintendent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to draw the attention of the Department on a matter which is urgent and most important. Re: New roof for our Pine Creek School.\n\nOn November 28, 1946, your report states a leaking roof and you were asking the Indian Affairs Branch the sum of $3000.00 for repairs. By letter of October 29, 1947, I was also asking an extra $2000.00 for the same purpose. I was also suggesting that a competent man be sent to give estimation of total cost.\n\nSo far absolutely nothing has been done. The roof is leaking worst than ever. During the last rain the water was so abundant that it penetrated in one of the electrical line, causing short circuit, which would have certainly cause fire, if not discovered on time. It was discovered by luck. We had to take off one fuse plug to cut off electricity from dormitory to prevent fire hazard.\n\nI hope the Indian Affairs Branch will realize in what serious predicament we are in and take immediate steps to have the roof replaced at once.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC. Ruest, O.M.I.\nJune 2nd, 1948.\n\nMr. G.R. Russell, for Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing letter from the principal of the Pine Creek School regarding the roof.\n\nWe are submitting the contents of the principal's letter to the Lands and Development Services Branch and we are hopeful that one of their engineers will visit the school in the very near future.\n\nBernard F.

During the last rain the water was so abundant that it penetrated one of the electric lines causing a short circuit, which would have caused a fire had it not been discovered in time. I hope the Indian Affairs Branch will realize the serious predicament we are in and take immediate steps to have the roof replaced at once.\"\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we have an amount of $5,000.00 provided for a new roof on this school. I would appreciate it if you would again bring the matter to Mr. Gow's attention so that he may visit the school as soon as possible and submit a report regarding what is required.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe attached letter and quotation has been received at this office from the Rev.

We carefully went into the matter of overcoming this problem in the most economical manner, and our proposal or recommendation to them to which they agreed, was that we supply an additional Type 10/2 Lister Diesel Engine, radiator cooled, which they could install with their present generator. Then we would overhaul their old engine which they brought in and return same to them, and this engine could be used to drive the water pump. This would split up the load, and would also give them two identical engines which could be used either for the pump or the generator in the event of failure of one of the units. This plan would also have the advantage in that all parts for the two engines would be identical; this would effect quite a saving.\n\nWe are, therefore, pleased to quote as follows on the above engine:\n\nONE - \"Lister\" Type 10/2 radiator cooled diesel engine, rated 10 H.P. at 600 RPM or 12 H.P. at 650 RPM.\nThis engine would be equipped with heavy electric type flywheels, standard equipment and spares.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

The principal of the Pine Creek School visited Mr. Davis recently and Mr. Davis writes as follows:\n\n\"Father Ruest, Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School was in the office regarding the installation of a new engine for the above mentioned school. Apparently they are having trouble charging the battery and pumping water. The matter has been taken up with Medland Machinery Limited and they recommend that a new unit be put in to take part of the load and the old engine overhauled.

I recommend that this new engine be purchased if funds are available.\"\n\nWe understand that Mr. Hargreaves is going west in the near future and as he is familiar with conditions at Pine Creek, I would appreciate it if you would bring this memorandum to his attention before he leaves.\n\nPP/MGD Director.\nMemorandum\n\nRe Pine Creek Indian Residential School\nCamperville, Manitoba\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Mr. Hoey under date of July 14th, 1948, to which was attached three memoranda covering inspections of the above, carried out by Mr. Wallace of Mr. Gov's staff.\n\nThe first memorandum deals with the conditions of the roof. This phase of the work is being studied by our Mr. Rankin and will be reported on at a later date.\n\nThe second memorandum, relating to the condition of the high pressure boiler and jacket heater, and the third memorandum referring to the bread mixer, have been analysed and the following report and recommendation is submitted for your information and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nFollowing an inspection of the mechanical services at the above by our Mr. Hargreaves on August 6th to 8th inclusive, 1948, our recommendation dated August 19th, 1948, was forwarded to Mr. Wardle. This memorandum contained a general report with reference to the boiler and jacket heater and definite recommendations were made.\n\nActing on the recommendations in part, the high pressure boiler was set up on a concrete base which was prepared by the members of the school staff and bricked in to directions left with the bricklayers by our Heating Engineer. The school authorities were advised to keep a very low fire in the boiler for drying out purposes for at least a week and then to commence at the brickwork would fail if a heavy fire was started and maintained before a thorough drying out had taken place. Evidently this warning was not taken seriously and the brickwork cracked within a short time of its installation. The bricklayers were recalled to the job and made repairs which were considered satisfactory by the Indian Agent and the school authorities. Mr. Wallace reports that the brickwork is again badly cracked and that escaping smoke and flue gases are causing a great deal of trouble. He also reports that the tubes are leaking and suggests that they should be replaced. The Provincial Boiler Inspector in his report dated October 6th, 1947, states that the condition of this boiler is good but that a complete new set of tubes should be installed.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIf the brickwork in this boiler setting has not buckled, it is likely that satisfactory repairs can be made. Since no mention is made by Mr. Wallace to the effect that buckling has taken place, it is recommended that Mr. Wallace's suggestions for repairing the present setting be carried out. They are as follows:\n\n(1) A high temperature cement with negligible shrinkage qualities equal to \"Demon Air Set\", as manufactured by the Plibrico Jointless Firebrick Company Limited of New Toronto, be applied to the interior of the brick setting in addition to an insulating cement made by the same people known as \"Eagle Cement 66\". A thick pliable mixture of the two cements should be thoroughly applied and forced into the cracks of the interior brickwork and the outside of the setting should be treated with a liberal coating of \"Demon Air Set\".\n\nIt is again pointed out that no matter how satisfactory a repair job is made, the same cracking of the walls will occur if a heavy fire is started and maintained before the new work has thoroughly dried out. It is felt that the school authorities should be forcibly reminded of their obligations in this regard.\n\n(2) It is recommended that the Provincial Boiler Inspector's advice be followed with reference to a complete set of new tubes for this boiler. There are approximately 28 tubes ten feet long and at an estimated price of fifty cents per lineal foot with a likely $300.00 installation charge, the cost would amount to approximately $450.00.\n\n(3) It is suggested that a new jacket heater be purchased and installed to replace the existing unit which was found to be practically burnt out at the time of the inspection made by our Heating Engineer in 1946. The new jacket heater should be equal to that made by the Gurney Manufacturing Company of Canada Limited, high test type No. 18-5 H.T. 2, having a tank capacity of 560 Imperial Gallons with an hourly capacity of approximately 100 gallons through 100 degrees temperature.\n\n(4) Mr. Wallace's suggestion with regard to replacing the 5 H.P. gasoline engine located in the bakery, with a 1-1/2 H.P. electric motor, is concurred in and it is recommended that this be carried out.\n\nA summary of the approximate cost:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| New tube for high pressure boiler         | $140.00|\n| Installation charges                      | $300.00|\n| Repairs to brick setting on high pressure boiler | $150.00|\n| New jacket heater                         | $175.00|\n| New 1-1/2 H.P. motor                      | $200.00|\n| 10% for contingencies                     | $96.50 |\n\nTotal - $1,061.50\n\nChief Engineer.\nAugust 18, 1948\n\nMemorandum\n\nA.M.\n\nRe: Pine Creek Indian Residential School\nCamperville, Manitoba,\nProposed Fire Escapes.\n\nIn your marginal note on Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you dated November 28, 1947, and further to our letter of the 6th instant, we have now received a report from Mr. Gow covering an inspection by Mr. Wallace of Mr. Gow's staff.\n\nAs Mr. Hoey indicates in his memorandum, the existing pole fire escapes are unsatisfactory. Mr. Wallace suggests two alternatives, namely, tubular steel fire escapes or wrought iron stairways.\n\nWe concur with his recommendation that the former are preferable. Being completely enclosed their efficiency is unaffected by weather, snow, ice, flame, smoke or falling objects. They provide faster and safer removal of personnel from the building. Two escape tubes 30 in diameter sloped at 30\u00b0 would be placed on the rear wall of the school. Entrances to the tubes would be from dormitories on the third floor and from a bedroom and classroom on the second.\n\nMr. Wallace has obtained a preliminary estimate of $3300.00 from Westeel Products Limited, for the two units installed complete. It is recommended that Indian Affairs give consideration to the installation of these fire escapes; if agreeable an amount of $3600.00 would be required.\n\nFor your information and consideration,\n\nDirector.\n\n16/8/48.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.

Davis, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur heating and electrical engineers have studied the proposal submitted by Mumford, Medland Limited, and it would appear that their recommendation to install a new Lister type 10/2, 10 horsepower radiator cooled diesel engine and to repair the existing engine so that it may be used to drive the water pump, is sound, provided that no additional load is to be taken care of by the existing generator.\n\nFrom data gathered at the school during an inspection trip made by our Mr. Hargreaves in August, 1946, it would seem safe to assume that no additional load will be imposed on the existing generator and it is our recommendation that Mumford, Medland's proposal be accepted.\n\nIt is felt that it will not be necessary to have our officer visit the above school in connection with this work.\n\nEncl.

This would overcome the necessity of purchasing a new engine. The Fort Alexander School does not require this engine as they are obtaining Hydro power.\n\nWe intend to communicate with Regional Supervisor Davis and find out the size of the engine at Fort Alexander, and its horsepower, also the cost of repairing it.

Crowe Co.\n\nKindly note that the first part of Invoices, dated July 8, covers the items ordered by the Department and amounts to less a few dollars less than the amount quoted on in June.\n\nAt the time estimations where made, I have asked for Plywood and Masonite but at the time it was not available, the Lumber yard could not quote prices at the time.\n\nOn July 31, I was notified by the Crowe Co. that a few pieces of the material wanted was available. Would I have referred to the Department for authorization, by the time I would have an answer this material would have been sold out, consequently I have taken the authority to place the order as it was absolutely needed and thinking that the Department would not refused.\n\nThen I asked the Crowe Co. to include this material with the other previously ordered.\n\nI am sorry to admit that it makes quite a difference, but I also knew at the time that my estimations of expenses for the repair of our Diesel Engine were above the mark and I was sure that the Department would be willing to use what was left from the estimation for repairs of the engine on this material.\n\nI am assured that the Department will find that I am not exceeding in expenses the total amount authorized.\n\nI hope that you will as well as the Department understand that I have done for the best and for the interest of both our school and the Department.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

(RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nLAUNDRY MACHINERY\n\nBeaver MERIT Washer\n\nTHE Beaver Merit Washer represents a combination of the highest washroom efficiency it is possible to obtain, with the lowest possible cost. We claim for this machine that it will do as much work, as good work and as quickly as the most expensive washer of equal size. The construction of this machine is a Monel Metal cylinder that is the last word in cylinder design, in a high grade Cypress tub, with every worth-while feature, such as dump outlets, added.\n\nThe Cylinder is the important part of the wash wheel and, if this embodies correct modern washing principles, the construction of the outer case is not so vital, and when to this cylinder is added the latest time-saving devices, the result is a washer equal, in the amount and quality of the work it will produce, to any machine made, no matter how high the price. In addition, the Merit Washer is a machine of pleasing appearance that is a credit to any washroom.\n\n(Over)\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\n\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP & CHEMICAL CO. LTD., WINNIPEG\nLAUNDRY MACHINERY\n\nThe outer case of the Merit Washer is of all heart stock clear Cypress. This tub is good for from ten to fifteen years' service, and is cheaply renewable. With two such tubs the Merit Washer will last twenty-five to thirty years. The doors and doors fronts are of Monel Metal, making a handsome, easily-cleaned machine. The doors are of a new design, close-water tight and free from objectionable dripping over. The machine is equipped with one eight-inch Rapid Discharge Valve, operated by foot lever, and one or more Rear Inlets connected to one three-inch header. Any inlet valves up to three-inch may be used. Other equipment includes Auxiliary Soap Doors, Loading Apron, Thermometer, Water Level Indicator, Rapid Hand Turning Device and Cylinder Lock. Blue Siphon can be supplied as an extra. There is a new design flat bumper bar to protect the tub from damage by loading trucks.\n\nThe Cylinder is made entirely of Monel Metal. Absolutely no other material is used in its construction, and it is, therefore, entirely free from rust or verdigris. The cylinder is constructed after the manner of a high-pressure steel boiler or tank. The heavy end plates and partitions are flanged on the circumference and securely riveted to the cylindrical side sheets. In addition to this there are Monel stay bolts at each end. There are three large open back perforated lifting shelves so that the load never falls across them\u2014an important point in net washing, as it tends to constrict the nets. The cylinder sheets are closely perforated with small double embossed holes. The embossing greatly increases the strength of the plates and makes a perfectly smooth inside to the cylinder. The small holes offer no chance for the smallest button or pin to get caught and torn off. The large number of perforations gives very rapid circulation. The cylinder doors are sliding, with neat removable locks. When closed, the doors are in positive engagement on all four sides, so that it is impossible for them to be distorted by the load.\n\nThe frames on which the machine is mounted are extra heavy rigid castings, and on them are mounted the bearings, which are roller type throughout. The gears are heavy, machine cut, with two-inch face, completely enclosed by gear guards. The trunions are extra heavy cast steel, operating in roller bearings. All bearings are always lubricated except the travel bearings for the reverse drum, which is run either with a deep oil well. In addition to being roller bearing, all bearings are adjustable so that wear may be taken up. A special arrangement of the gears ensures a quiet-running machine at all times.\n\nWe are confident that no other washer ever offered to the laundry trade combines so much in value and productiveness, at anywhere near the price, as the Merit Washer.\n\n| Size          | 36 x 36 | 36 x 54 | 36 x 72 | 42 x 40 | 42 x 54 | 42 x 84 | 42 x 96 |\n|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Compartments  | One     | One     | Two     | One     | One     | Two     | Ten     |\n| Gearing       | Single  | Single  | Double  | Single  | Simple  | Double  | Double  |\n| Centre Leg    | No      | No      | Yes     | No      | No      | Yes     | Yes     |\n| Pulleys and Speed | 2\u00bd and 2 | 2\u00bd and 2 | 3 and 2\u00bd | 2\u00bd and 2 | 2\u00bd and 2 | 3 and 2\u00bd | 3 and 2\u00bd |\n| Belts          | One     | One     | Two     | One     | One     | Two     | Two     |\n| No. of 6\" Outlets | One     | One     | Two     | One     | One     | Two     | Two     |\n| No. of 2\u00bd\" Inlets | One     | One     | Two     | One     | One     | Two     | Two     |\n| Floor Space   | 54 x 66 | 54 x 84 | 54 x 108 | 54 x 70 | 54 x 84 | 54 x 120 | 54 x 132 |\n| Weight        | 2300    | 2700    | 3500    | 2500    | 2700    | 4000    | 5000    |\n\nThe above are our standard sizes, on which we are equipped to give prompt delivery.

Nous pr\u00e9tendons que cette machine fournira autant de travail, et tout aussi bon et aussi rapide que n'importe laquelle des machines \u00e0 laver des plus co\u00fbteuses de m\u00eame grandeur. La construction de cette machine est un cylindre en M\u00e9tal Monel, c.\u00e0.d. le tout dernier mot en fait de construction et mod\u00e8le de cylindre, dans une cuve de Cypr\u00e8s de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure, et la machine est \u00e9galement munie de tous les derniers perfectionnements, soupapes pour videment rapide, etc.\n\nLe Cylindre est la partie importante de la roue de lavage et si ceci comprend les principes de lavage modernes corrects, la construction de la coque ext\u00e9rieure n'est pas si importante, et quand \u00e0 ce cylindre sont joints les tout derniers perfectionnements pour \u00e9conomiser le temps et le labeur, l'on a comme r\u00e9sultat une machine \u00e0 laver qui est \u00e9quivalente, en ce qui concerne l'ouvrage et la qualit\u00e9 de l'ouvrage fourni, \u00e0 n'importe quelle machine fabriqu\u00e9e, peu en importe le prix. En plus, la Machine \u00e0 Laver Merit est une machine qui a une belle et agr\u00e9able apparence, et qui fait honneur \u00e0 n'importe quelle salle de buanderie.\n\n(Tournez s. v. p.)\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nMONTREAL - TORONTO\nLe cylindre est construit selon le principe d'une cuve \u00e0 haute pression. Les fortes plaques aux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s et les cloisons sont brid\u00e9es \u00e0 la circonf\u00e9rence et bien riv\u00e9es aux t\u00f4les de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cylindriques. En plus de cela il y a des entretoises en Monel allant d'un bout \u00e0 l'autre. Il y a trois grandes traverses perfor\u00e9es, \u00e0 dos ouvert, plac\u00e9es de sorte que jamais la charge ne p\u00e8se sur elles un point central pour le lavage avec filet car cela a tendance d'\u00e9pargner les filets. Les t\u00f4les du cylindre sont perfor\u00e9es, avec les trous tr\u00e8s rapproch\u00e9s et doubl\u00e9es repouss\u00e9es. Le repoussage augmente la solidit\u00e9 des t\u00f4les de beaucoup, et donne une surface parfaitement unie \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du cylindre. Les petits trous n'offrent aucune occasion au plus petit bouton ou \u00e0 une \u00e9pingle de s'accrocher et d'\u00eatre arrach\u00e9s. Le grand nombre de trous donne une circulation tr\u00e8s rapide. Les portes du cylindre sont \u00e0 coulisse avec des serrures d\u00e9montables ayant belle apparence. Quand elles sont ferm\u00e9es, les portes sont positivement engag\u00e9es des quatre c\u00f4t\u00e9s, de sorte qu'il est impossible de les d\u00e9former par la charge.\n\nLes cadres sur lesquels la machine est mont\u00e9e sont des pi\u00e8ces coul\u00e9es extra-lourdes et rigides, et sur elles les paliers sont mont\u00e9s, qui eux sont du type \u00e0 rouleaux de toute part. Les engrenages sont solides, coup\u00e9s \u00e0 la machine et ayant une surface de deux pouces, en plus ils sont compl\u00e8tement entour\u00e9s de gardes-engrenages.

En plus d'\u00eatre des paliers \u00e0 rouleaux, tous les paliers sont ajustables de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre de faire face \u00e0 l'usure. Un arrangement sp\u00e9cial des engrenages assure que la machine fonctionnera sans bruit tout le temps.\n\nNous sommes persuad\u00e9s qu'aucune autre machine \u00e0 laver qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte aux buanderies combine autant en valeur et productivit\u00e9, \u00e0 un prix se rapprochant un tant soit peu du notre, que la Machine \u00e0 Laver Merk.\n\n| GRANDEUR | 36 x 36 | 36 x 54 | 36 x 72 | 42 x 40 | 42 x 54 | 42 x 84 | 42 x 96 |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Compartiments | Un Simple | Un Simple | Deux Double | Un Simple | Un Simple | Deux Double | Dix Double |\n| Engrenage | Non | Non | Oui | Non | Non | Oui | Oui |\n| Pied Central (Support) | 2\u00bd et 2 | 2\u00bd et 2 | 3 et 2\u00bd | 2\u00bd et 2 | 2\u00bd et 2 | 2\u00bd et 2 | 2\u00bd et 2 |\n| Poules et Vitesse | Une | Une | Deux | Une | Une | Deux | Deux |\n| Courroies | Une | Une | Deux | Une | Une | Deux | Deux |\n| Nombre de Sorties de 6 pouces | Une | Une | Deux | Une | Une | Deux | Deux |\n| Nombre d'Entr\u00e9es de 2\u00bd pouces | 54 x 66 | 54 x 84 | 54 x 108 | 54 x 70 | 54 x 84 | 54 x 120 | 54 x 132 |\n| Terrain Occup\u00e9 | 2300 | 2500 | 3500 | 2500 | 2700 | 4000 | 5000 |\n\nLes Machines ci-dessus sont nos quelques types et nous sommes \u00e9quip\u00e9s pour une livraison rapide.

It may be inferred that Frank Bumstead is not in a position to quote, due to other commitments.\n\nIt is pointed out that this school is quite inaccessible in the winter months either by highway or railroad, and if an immediate inspection was considered necessary, it would involve the use of a snowmobile at considerable expense.\n\nAlthough the work projected is necessary, it is considered that no actual emergency exists. Consequently we have requested Mr. Gow to advise the firm of Messrs Neale, Stothard and Chapman that he is prepared to receive their quotation as soon as it is possible for them to visit the school. He has also been requested to forward their price to this Division for consideration and analysis, as soon as it is received by him. At that time you will be further advised.\n\nR.A.

It was simply advising you that authority had been given to the Lands and Development Services Branch to make expenditures at the Pine Creek School.\n\nWere the items which you included on Voucher 168 purchased by Mr. Gow? If so, we would like to have a letter from him to that effect, so that it will assist us in obtaining a Purchase Order.\n\nWith reference to Voucher 201, you quote as authority letter dated 28th November, 1948.

Our recommendations based on Mr. Gow's report embraced work to the approximate value of $12,000.00.\n\nMajor MacKay replied under date of October 6th, 1948, stating that no funds had been provided in the Indian Affairs 1948-49 estimates for the work, but asked for a further recommendation before the 1949-50 estimates were prepared.\n\nA memorandum to you under date of January 15th, 1949, stated that Mr. Gow's latest information showed the building to be safe for occupancy, and justified carrying out the proposed repairs. No comments or further instructions have been received from Indian Affairs, until the present.\n\nWe assume that Major MacKay's memorandum is authority for further action, and staff will be assigned to the project as soon as possible.\n\nWhen structural data is ready, we will ask Mr. Gow to invite tenders.\n\nChas.

They requested paint last January but did not receive same but were under the impression that the paint would be forwarded after the 31st of March. The Reverend Father and the Sisters are very anxious to get started on the painting as soon as the school closes as in a month they will be going on Retreat.\n\nRegarding the requisition for Battleship linoleum. The halls and some of the floors, especially the sitting room floor, are in very poor condition. The flooring is only spruce and it is necessary to cover them either with Battleship linoleum or put down a new floor. I consider the Battleship linoleum would be the best and less expensive. The floors would then be much easier to keep clean.\n\nI strongly recommend that the attached requisitions be granted as Rev. Ruest, The Principal, is one Principal that looks after everything he receives. If you could rush these requisitions it would be appreciated.

This particular boiler was bricked in several years ago and the work failed to stand up. Since new setting is required it is proposed to take advantage of the latest and most up-to-date method of carrying out this work. With the plastic fire brick setting most of the individual fire bricks are eliminated, and a \"Flibrico\" plastic material having equal or superior refractory qualities is now in general use. This material has one important advantage over the individual fire bricks, in that any handy man can effect a repair and the repair can be bonded in satisfactorily. This is not true of settings which are wholly comprised of individual fire bricks.\n\nWe have examined the price quoted by the aforementioned firm and while somewhat higher than anticipated, it is felt that their proposition should be accepted. The only other alternative is to install a new steel fire box type boiler requiring no brick enclosure at a cost of approximately $3,500.00.\n\nWe are therefore recommending that this work be awarded to the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company on the basis of their quotation in the amount of $1,566.00. When the Indian Affairs Branch indicate their approval, we will instruct Mr. Gow to have the work started.\n\nIt is understood that a number of tubes in this boiler will have to be replaced. This work will cost an additional $300.00 to $400.00.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nfor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A.

This matter was taken up last year. However, I felt that we had better wait and see if the power would go into the school this past summer. I have now been advised that there is a possibility of the power going as far as Winnipegosis this spring and probably further. Therefore, I do not feel that we should spend money on an engine at this time.\n\nFort Alexander School have a good 10 H.P. Lister engine that is not in use. This engine I understand is the property of the school - not the Department. However, I feel if you took the matter up with the Principal that he would be quite willing to let us have this engine. This engine could then be used at the Pine Creek School until such time as the power reaches that point.\n\nR. S.

Ltd. of Winnipeg, a copy of which is attached. Also attached is a copy of Mr. Gow's covering letter which is self-explanatory.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Gow appears to be having considerable difficulty in obtaining additional tenders. In a project of this size where considerable urgency exists and many indeterminate factors are present, it seems advisable to have the work undertaken on a basis of cost plus a fixed fee.\n\nThe lump sum tender of $13,700.00 quoted by the Bolton Construction Co. Ltd. includes overhead and profit and is considered reasonable, but the actual cost may be reduced when work is commenced, since some material from the existing roof may be salvaged and re-used, the actual amount of which, neither the Bolton Construction Co. Ltd. nor our engineers can evaluate until work begins.\n\nOn the basis of cost plus a fixed fee we believe that the total cost of the work will be closer to our estimate of $12,000.00 than the price submitted, and it is recommended that approval for this action be obtained from Indian Affairs.\n\nWe would then be enabled to request Mr. Gow to obtain from the Bolton Construction Co.

Neary, Superintendent\nof Indian Education\n\nFurther reference to my letter of October 28, 1949,\nfile No. 149/8-8-582 regarding an engine for the Pine Creek\nIndian Residential School.\n\nFather Ruest, former Principal of the Pine Creek\nSchool and who is now at Pine Falls Residential School,\ncalled in the office this morning and advised me that we\ncould have the engine at Pine Falls. However, Father Ruest\nexpects us to allow him something for this engine. I under-\nstand that we paid $500.00 and the balance was paid by the\nOblate Fathers. Father Ruest claims that the value of the\nengine at the present time would be about $1200.00. Therefore,\nthey would require $700.00.\n\nI am of the opinion that the above mentioned engine\nwould answer our purpose until the power line goes into that\narea. The engine in question is the same that is being used\nat the present time at the Pine Creek School.\n\nWe have a complete set of batteries belonging to the\nDepartment at the Pine Creek School. These batteries are in\nfairly good condition and could be used in another school.\nPlease advise and I will have them crated and shipped.\n\nRSD/MO\n\nH. S.

Father Ruest at that time Principal of the Pine Creek School, who in turn ordered the items as listed on Department letter of November 17th 48, on the assumption that the Department would pay for them.\n\nOur voucher #201 dated March 5th 1949 attached was forwarded to the Department for payment, and was returned to this office under there letter of 14th April 1949 file #582/5 (El).\n\nAgain on March 19th 1949 letter was received from the Department, this letter also is attached with my reply requesting further as to how this could be cleared away.\n\nBoth Father Ruest, and Father De-Bretange were informed from this office the contents of Deptm. letter dated 14th April 1949 with instructions to the effect that these accounts should be paid, or the items returned. I may that no further action has been taken by this office.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 10)\nFor your information I have just been in contact with the Rev. Father De-Bretonange this morning by phone, he has advised me as follows.\n\nWorkmen from Winnipeg on Mr. Gow's authority are now at the Pine Creek Residential School repairing the brick setting on the high pressure boiler as authorized by the Department in their letter of authority attached dated November 20th 1948 file # 582-5 (El) one year ago.\n\nFather states that items (c) and (d) of the above mentioned authority are not being completed as authorized. I would recommend that the accounts in this connection be paid by the Department as they are required very badly.\n\nIn this connection please find attached accounts that have not been paid to date in connection with letter from the Deptm. authority dated November 20th 1949 file # 582/5 (El).\n\nThe new jacket heater is still at Pine Creek (not installed yet) also the electric motor (not installed yet) I would request your assistance in receiving authority from the Department for the payment of these two items.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Wm. Gowans,\nSuperintendent.\n\nG O P Y\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Dauphin Agency vouchers numbers 168 and 201, which vouchers are for payment of items ordered for the above mentioned school.\n\nRegional Supervisor Davis is presently on an inspection trip of the Northern Agencies of this Province, and before leaving asked me to take up the matter of payment of these vouchers with both Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water & Power Bureau, and the Department.\n\nIn addition to the vouchers, I am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Mr. Gowans, Superintendent of the Dauphin Agency, relative to the vouchers in question.\n\nThe items in these vouchers were, apparently, ordered on the strength of Department letter of November 20th, 1948, file 582-5 (E.1) and according to Mr. Gowans' letter, the items in question were ordered by Father Ruest, Principal of the school. It has been pointed out to Mr. Gowans, both on this and several other occasions, that no expenditures may be made from Departmental funds without reference to this office - and it is not understood why these items were ordered on the strength of your original letter of November 20th, 1948.\n\nMr. Gow, of the Dominion Water & Power Bureau, was interviewed in connection with these expenditures, and has advised me as follows, referring again to your letter of November 20, 1949, file 582-5 (E.1) -\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(a) The high pressure boiler was retubed prior to Mr. Gow's staff visiting the school, and this voucher has been submitted and paid for.\n\n(b) The repairs to the brick setting on the high pressure boiler have only recently been completed by Mr. Gow's Branch, and the bills have not as yet been submitted, but the approximate cost is in the neighborhood of $1,800.00.\n\n(c) & (d) These items are for the equipment, vouchers for which are attached hereto, and which vouchers are in dispute.\n\nOn discussing this matter with Mr. Gow, he referred to correspondence held in his office under file I.A. 1456 - 11 dated April 30th, and signed by Mr. T. S. Mills, Chief Engineer of the Engineering and Construction Division. Mr. Mills' letter to Mr. Gow, in the first paragraph, mentions that this matter had been discussed with Indian Affairs' Officials, and it was realized that your original instructions - again referring to your letter, file 582-5 of November 20th - had been misinterpreted by Mr. Gowans and the school Principal, and they had gone ahead and ordered the jacket heater and the new motor.\n\nMr. Gow further stated that he felt that these bills were legitimate, and although they had been ordered in an unorthodox manner, he felt that the accounts should be paid; and referring to Mr. Gowans' letter, a copy of which I have attached hereto, I notice the jacket heater and the electric motor are on hand at the school - although they have not as yet been installed.\n\nThe above is forwarded for your information, and Mr. Davis has requested that if at all possible, provision be made for the payment of these accounts, as they have been outstanding since February, 1949.\n\nYour further comments regarding the installation of the electric motor and jacket heater would be appreciated, and immediately your further instructions are received, the matter will be further discussed with Mr. Gowans of the Dauphin Agency.\n\nRegional Supervisor of INDIAN Agencies.\n\nJR/ES\n\nEngl.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReference your Army Signal dated November 5, 1949 and this office letter dated October 27, 1949, file No. 149/6-1-582.

G. Ruest, Principal, Fort Alexander Residential School, which is self-explanatory.\n\nYou will notice by his letter that the cost price of the engine at the Fort Alexander Residential School was $947.00. Apparently the Church were reimbursed in the amount of $500 and also had the engine overhauled at a cost of $149.13. When the matter of the engine was taken up with me I was led to believe that the Church had purchased the engine and it was their property. According to the letter received from Rev. Ruest they were reimbursed in amount of $500.00. Therefore, I feel that the school should be paid only $447.00. While this engine has been used it was used in one of our schools. Therefore, the above I see as only fair.\n\nWe have a set of batteries that are in fair condition that were purchased in March, 1947, from Ashdown's. Will it be in order for me to ship these batteries to the Pine Creek School. If they are left the way they are they will only deteriorate.\n\nR. S.

Consequently, it is felt that the school management should not expect to be reimbursed for the full amount which they provided towards its cost. Besides, if the management of the Fort Alexander School agree to the transfer, it is our intention to transfer the engine to another school conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order.\n\nWe feel that the Department should not be expected to pay the Fort Alexander School more than $100.00, and it is hoped that the management will accept this offer. In that event, you may forward a Voucher and payment will be made immediately. You can also arrange for the transfer of the engine and batteries to the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nBernard F.

Rose du Lac, contractor has inspected the roof at Pine Creek Residential School, and submits a contract price on demolishing the old roof and reconstructing a new one, material and labour $31,800.00.\n\nMr. Leperre is using Plan #1 as a basis, although the trestle material in this plan is on the light side. All the plumbing on the third floor has to be replaced, new pipes, wash basins, and shower. The toilet will be remodelled, but will not have to be replaced.\n\nPartitions have to be torn out and rebuilt; clothes, closets have to be torn out and replaced with new material. Three dead smoke stacks have to be levelled to the third floor and sealed. Four new ventilators must be constructed, two in each room. Windows at present are small, not waterproof, and are inadequate for lighting. It is considered that four groups of three windows in each room would be sufficient. Wiring will have to in conduit piping. Walls and ceiling will be insulated with rockwool pads finished with gyproc and two coats of paint. Roof is asphalt shingles, 210 lb. per sq. with No. 1 tarpaper.\n\nIt will not be possible to use any of the old material in the roof - the timbers are hand-hewn and are warped, and the plumbing is lead pipes.\n\nOn completion of the contract, debris will be cleared.\n\nMr. Leperre recommends that work be commenced on this project in March, so that considerable progress can be made before rain can be expected, and while the roads are hard for hauling.\n\n(sgd) William Gowans\nSupt.

It has been suggested by the Father Principal that a new Dryer be installed.\n\nOn my last visit to that school this Dryer was inspected, it appears to be old and in poor condition, and I am afraid that it would have to have considerable repairs.\n\nI would therefore recommend that a new Dryer be installed as repairs required will have to be specially made for it each time something goes wrong.\n\nWm.

We are sure this would save time and expense, as we have very little information on the number of pipes and dimensions. This Tumbler is now twenty years old and we have not built this type of Tumbler for at least twelve years, and would almost have to have the coil back, or failing that to have very accurate dimensions.\"\n\nIt would appear that there is no alternative to having a new set of coils made and if you would send the\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Manitoba.\n\ncentre bank of coils to us, we could have them made up in Winnipeg for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHARRISONS & CROSFIELD (CANADA) LTD.,\n\nH.

If not, you should contact the firm at once and have the supplies delivered so that they can be invoiced before the end of March.\n\nIt is most important that we receive the account, if at all possible, before March 31st so that payment can be made from the appropriation for the current year which ends on March 31st.

And if the Department was not notified yet of the delivery of these goods it was completely due to somebody's else fault Mr Gowans knew that the material was delivered and commissioned me to check it up long time ago, but I personally know that these lumber yards are very slow to move.

We obtained an amount of $5,000.00 in the Supplementary Estimates 1949-50, and have bought materials at an approximate cost of $5,800.00.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible what type of barn the school management wishes to erect, and also the cost of the labour. It is presumed that the school management will provide some of the labour at least without cost to the Department. However, if it is necessary to engage a foreman, you should submit the name and address of the person whom it is intended to employ, in order that we can obtain the Minister's approval.\n\nIn your letter of June 27th, 1949, you mentioned that the cost of the barn would be approximately $11,000.00. As we have already expended $5,800.00, it is presumed that the labour will not exceed $5,200.00. Of course, if the school management provide some of the labour free of charge, the cost of labour should be less than the amount stated.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe were unable to provide any specific amount for this barn in the appropriation for the 1950-51 fiscal year, and consequently, the additional amount to be spent on it will be charged against the sum provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nI hope that you will let us hear from you at an early date, outlining the present situation regarding the barn. It is to be understood that the work should not proceed until all parties concerned are fully aware of the cost and our authority has been given.\n\nBernard F.

It appears that Mr. Gowans has taken advantage of this opportunity to have included in the latter two tenders, all the required alterations and new work he would like to have done to the top storey of this school. We feel that the tenders of Laperre and Freihheit are too high and are not based entirely on our drawings and specifications while the price submitted by the Bolton Construction Company is an approximate estimate only.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it may be seen that the obtaining of tenders has not been altogether satisfactory, but with improved weather conditions it should be possible for contractors to visit the site and examine the roof and dormitories and thus be able to prepare bona fide tenders.\n\nThe work may have to be undertaken on a basis of cost plus a fixed fee, but the possibility of obtaining lump sum tenders should be given consideration.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was only after considerable study of the plans and of various reports that the building was passed as safe for occupancy and the opinion reached that the life expectancy of the structure warranted the expenditure required for a new roof.\n\nThe roof has been leaking for several years and is reported to be structurally unsound and in need of replacement. As pointed out in a preceding paragraph, the Indian Superintendent appears to have in mind a considerable amount of repair work including toilets, plumbing, electric lighting, new windows, removal of partitions, etc., the extent or value of which we are not in a position to assess until an inspection is made. When such an inspection is made, this item will be noted and an estimate prepared for consideration by Indian Affairs, but the replacement of the roof should receive priority over any other factors unless the Indian Affairs Branch wish to amplify their original proposal to this Service, and have funds for the purpose.\n\nWe will appreciate receiving instructions on the matter.\n\nChief.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR\n\nNEW ROOF - PINE CREEK RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nCAMPERVILLE, MANITOBA.\n\nWith reference to our memorandum of the 15th of March relative to the above, it is proposed to transfer responsibility for the proposed work from Mr. D.

It is not usual for so many beds to go out of condition at the same time. When forwarding the requisition, Mr. Gowans wrote as follows:\n\n\"The 103 beds requested are to replace the old beds, most all of which the springs are broken in many places. Some of them have been restrung with clothes wire, and others have been repaired with electric wire. These beds are of a type that one cannot replace the spring, as the spring and frame are all in one. Many of them are without casters, and I feel that the time has come when they should be replaced. The old beds could be given to many families on the reserve where I am sure they would be appreciated.\"\n\nIf the beds are in as bad a condition as Mr. Gowans states, I doubt if they would be of much value to anyone on the reserve. Purchase of the beds and mattresses requested will involve a considerable sum of money, and before making any decision in the matter, we would appreciate your comments.\n\nBernard F.

Father M.de Bretagne mentioned the fact that there is 150 Barrels Portland Cement (1 Car Load) arriving for the Pine Creek School.\n\nWe have now received copy of this purchase order which is for as mentioned 1 car load of cement, I regret that we did not know anything about this, neither did the Rev Father.\n\nIt appears that this was arranged with the Department and one of the Rev. Fathers stationed in Ottawa, Rev. de Bretagne is at a loss as to what to do with this cement, there is no doubt that some of it could be used but I feel that the amount of 1 car load is far too much, plus the fact that cement does not keep very long.\n\nRev. Father de Bretagne feels that perhaps he could trade this cement for other items needed with some of the Dealers locally, this I suggested that he had better wait until we hear what Winnipeg has to say.\n\nIf your office has any information as to what is to be done with this cement it would be appreciated very much indeed, meantime we are at a loss as to what is to be done with it.\n\nFor your information it was ordered from \"Canada Cement Co., Ltd., Canada Cement Building, Montreal, P.Q.\" and was shipp-\n\nIndian Affairs.

As pointed out in official letter of April 27th, we were unable to provide any specific amount for this barn in the appropriation for the current fiscal year. Consequently, any additional amount over and above that which we have already spent must be charged against the sum provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment for this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we have provided an amount of $4,000.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. We have already paid accounts amounting to $703.00 and in addition we have ordered desks, and these will cost approximately $1,500.00. This makes a total expenditure from the amount provided for this school of $2,203.00, leaving a balance of slightly less than $1,800.00 which is available.\n\nThe tender which you forwarded from Mr. A.B. Ahlen is in an amount of $2,916.00 which is considerably more than the amount we have available. Under these circumstances, it is not possible for us to consider this tender.\n\nIn Mr. Gowans' letter to you dated May 29th, he stated that he could only secure the one tender. Do you consider it would be possible to secure others, probably at a less cost. In the event of a lower tender being...\nsubmitted, and if we approve same, it should be distinctly understood by the Principal that the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school has been fully expended.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Perrie does not seem to have any more success in interesting contractors than Mr. Gow. The former quotes as follows:\n\n\"It is rather doubtful that satisfactory tenders will be received on the basis outlined in your memorandum of May 16, consequently, efforts are being made to locate other contractors who might be interested and failing that to obtain a satisfactory estimate covering the cost of the work on a straight day labour basis.\"\n\n3.

We approved the work proceeding under Mr. Gow's direction.\n\nAt the time we notified the local Indian Superintendent that we were approving the recommendation of the Lands and Development Services Branch, and he in turn notified the Principal of the Pine Creek School. The latter did not wait for Mr. Gow to make the purchase, and we have been endeavouring to obtain a definite approval from Mr. Gow.\n\nIn a recent letter Regional Supervisor Davis advises as follows: \"Mr. Gow further stated that he felt that the account was legitimate, and although the purchase had been made in an unorthodox manner, he felt that the account should be paid.\" We endeavoured to obtain confirmation of Mr. Gow's statement, but up to the present have not been able to do so.\n\nWe realize that the Principal had no right to purchase the high pressure boiler, but there is no doubt that it was needed and that it has been in use for the past year. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows:\n\n582-516-12-415.\n\nBernard F.

Gowans,\nIndian Agent,\nDauphin, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Gowans:\n\nWe wish to confirm our long distance conversation with you today following call from Father DeBretagne regarding a new tumbler.\n\nThe machine now in Camperville is a 32 x 40 belt driven, and we offer the same size machine, also belt driven, at $935.00, sales tax of 8% extra, f.o.b. Toronto. We gave you a price of $1135.00, tax extra, f.o.b. Toronto, which unfortunately was an error on our part and we are glad to now be able to correct it.\n\nThe enclosed catalogue sheet illustrates a 42 x 60 belted motor drive, but the 32 x 40 is similar in appearance, only smaller and instead of a motor on the fan, then only the pulleys would be there for the belt to be connected with the present jackshaft in Camperville, or in other words the machine would be driven in the very same way as the present one.\n\nOur principals, Beaver Laundry Machinery Co., Ltd., have of course made many mechanical improvements, such as the greater efficiency obtained through the heating element now being a copper fin coil, which has proven to be the means of economy in steam consumption.\n\nShould it be that you would wish to consider installing a larger machine, the next size manufactured is a 42 x 40, and that machine belt driven would be $1375.00, sales tax extra, f.o.b. Toronto.\n\nWe very much appreciate the opportunity we had of briefly discussing this machine on the phone,\nMr. W. Gowans,\n\nFebruary 14, 1950.\n\nand trust it may be our privilege to have our Government order for a new machine for Camperville.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHARRISONS & CROSFIELD (CANADA) LTD.,\n\nC.E.Viau/A\nTHE Beaver Royal Tumblers are a distinct departure from standard practice. They are of all-welded steel construction, light in weight but exceedingly strong. This saving in weight without any sacrifice of strength enables us to make very attractive quotations on these machines.\n\nThese tumblers are of the \"Dry by Air\" type and have a specially designed fan of very high capacity with low horse power consumption. This draws immense volumes of air, at high velocity, through the clothes, drying quickly and thoroughly.\nBeaver Royal Tumbler\u2014(Continued)\n\nwithout the use of a high degree of heat, and finishing the load as sweet and clean as if dried in the open air.\n\nThe air heating element is a copper fin coil. This is standard in Beaver Royal Tumblers but is only installed in competitive makes at an extra cost. This fin coil gives a very great economy in steam consumption, or if desired a much greater degree of heat. By means of one small lever the amount of heat can be regulated to any degree. As the hot air is closed off the cold air is opened.\n\nThe Tumbler as shown in the illustration is a Laundry Type machine. For dry cleaning a steaming device is arranged in the inlet and explosion safety doors are set in the rear of the tumbler.\n\nThe Tumbler is supplied in a variety of sizes from 32 x 40 to 46 x 120 and in Belt Drive, Belted Motor Drive or Direct Connected Motor Drive. The Fan may be either Belt or Motor Drive in combination with any of the above. Sizes up to 42 x 60 are single geared end driven. Sizes 42 x 90 and over are double geared elevated drive.\n\n---\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n| Size    | Capacity Dry Weight | Motor | Fan Motor | Weight | Floor Space |\n|---------|---------------------|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|\n| 32 x 40 | 35 lbs.             | 1 h.p.| 14\"       | 2,240  | 4' 3\" x 8'  |\n| 42 x 40 | 65 lbs.             | 1\u00bd h.p.| 16\"     | 3,000  | 5' x 8'10\"  |\n| 42 x 60 | 100 lbs.            | 2 h.p.| 18\"     | 3,500  | 5' x 10' 6\" |\n| 42 x 90 | 150 lbs.            | 2 h.p.| 20\"     | 5,500  | 5' x 13' 8\" |\n| 42 x 120| 200 lbs.            | 3 h.p.| 22\"     | 7,500  | 5' x 16'10\" |\n| 46 x 120| 280 lbs.            | 3 h.p.| 22\"     | 8,500  | 5' 10\" x 16'10\" |\n\n---\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co.

Waite, Acting Superintendent, Dauphin Indian Agency, regarding fire escapes for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. Before anything is done regarding these fire escapes I think it would be a good idea to try out the fire escapes that you showed me while in Ottawa.

It is my understanding that Mr. Simpson is still interested in this contract, and I would refer you to a copy of Agency letter dated May 16, 1950, the original directed to the Department. For your immediate information, a further copy is attached hereto.\n\nMy understanding is that the job was taken under contract by Mr. Simpson and it is quite possible that the accountable cheque was necessary for Mr. Simpson to pay his help. I am unable to contact Mr. Simpson at the moment, but would make request that accountable cheque be forwarded to this office.\n\nJ.

I beg to request an accountable cheque for the labour - $524.00.\n\nThere would appear to be an error in above Department letter, which includes material and labour at a cost of $524.00.

Buck, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Roof, Pine Creek School - Camperville, Man.\n\nArriving in Winnipeg on Wednesday Aug. 16th, I met Mr. Davis and Mr. Krawchuk and arranged to leave for Camperville by car on the following day. Copies of plans, specifications and bills of materials had been received by Mr. Davis from Mr. Perrie.\n\nOn Thursday Aug. 17th Mr. Krawchuk and I arrived at the school in the late evening. As the Principal was away on holiday we were not able to obtain any details of the structural changes made in the school since it was originally built although we were told that it was about 50 years old.\n\nThe roof was examined the next day and numerous measurements were taken. The present trusses consisting of two leaves of 2 x 6 with two inch pack pieces for both top and bottom chords with diagonal webs are spaced at about 15' 6\" centres. They appear to be of tamarack timber which is well preserved. The middle of each lower chord rests on posts of double 2 x 6 with 2 inch pack pieces, which posts also continue through vertically to the ridge. The trusses do not appear to swing and thus really consist of four braced beams in each case. Purlins of 2 x 6 dapped two inches under the upper chords carry the intermediate 2 x 4 rafters spaced about 20 to 22 inches on centres.\n\nThe roof sags both longitudinally and laterally as also does the dormitory ceiling. Numerous truss type braces have been recently placed in the attic to help both the trusses and the ceiling joists to carry their loads. The pitch of the roof is about one quarter. It would seem advisable to prevent the accumulation of a heavy snow load while the roof is in its present condition.\n\nWhile the timbers visible in the attic appear to be in good condition it would seem necessary to rebuild the roof according to the new design to remedy structural defects and provide a fireproof covering to the weather.\n\n-2-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEnquiries were made regarding materials. The long Fir timbers for the trussed rafters can be obtained in Winnipeg and other materials in Winnipeg and Dauphin. Mr. Davis will secure prices and then ask Head Office for authority to purchase the first and subsequent lots of materials by local purchase order. This procedure is necessary to avoid delay as Winter is approaching when further work on the roof would be difficult to do without damage to existing installations in the building.\n\nThe estimated cost of the job is $15,000.00 but it might run to a higher cost if the weather and other circumstances are not favourable. Kindly send Mr. Davis an advance of $7500.00 for wages and incidentals.\n\nThe school generally is being maintained in good condition with much new paint in evidence but the wooden floors are wavy and sag slightly in many places.\n\nThe fire escapes from the second and third floors are of a type which is unsuitable for use by small children. The method of descent from a platform to the next and from that platform to the ground is to shin down a metal pole.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPhilip Shaw.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther reference to your letter under file No. 582-5 (El) dated June 6, 1950, I am enclosing, herewith, requisition for material in connection with putting on the new roof on the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. Mr. Shaw recently visited this school with Mr. Krawchuk, Building Supervisor, and Mr. Krawchuk has now completed a requisition for the material, which is enclosed herewith.\n\nThe season is getting late and if it is the intention of the Department for me to undertake this work and have Mr. Krawchuk supervise the work, also a foreman in charge I would request that I receive authority for local purchase on all of the material. Otherwise, there is no use me undertaking this work as it could not be completed this fall. Purchasing orders take from one to two months to get through and as this work should be completed in two months it is absolutely essential that I have authority for local purchase. The purchases would be divided among various lumber companies on the list and best prices obtained where the material is available.\n\nIf the above is satisfactory I would request that an advance of $3,000.00 be sent to Superintendent Staunton for wages and this will be accounted for. Payment will be made to the carpenters and a new request made for amounts as needed. I would be pleased if you would give this your special attention.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRSD/MO\nENCLS.\nDauphin, Manitoba,\nAugust 18, 1950.\n\nMr. Shaw,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nJ.

In an effort to ascertain the names of additional contractors who might be interested in quoting on this work Mr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor, Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man., was asked to furnish me with the names of any contractors that he felt might be interested. Mr. Davis was also asked to advise whether or nor Mr. Krawchuk, Supervisor of Construction, would be available to supervise this project in the event that it was considered advisable to undertake same on a straight day labour basis.\n\n3. Mr. H.D. Spratling of Brandon advises that due to the amount of work he has already on hand it would not be possible for him to undertake the work at this school. I am attaching hereto a tender from Mr. A. Freiheit in which he offers to undertake the work at a price of $29,823.60, to which letter is attached a certified cheque in the amount of $2,928.36. Mr. Freiheit is the only contractor who appears to be interested in undertaking the work on a lump sum basis. Letters from the Bolton Construction Co., Ltd. and from Marcel Leperre, offering to undertake the work on a basis of cost plus a fixed fee are also attached.\n\n4. I am also attaching copy of a letter received from Mr. R.S. Davis in which he mentions Arlington Builders, Winnipeg, as the only firm other than those mentioned above that might be interested in tendering on this work. Mr. Davis also states that although Mr. Krawchuk would not be able to remain continually on the job during its progress he has in mind a suitable foreman that might be engaged to carry on with the work under Mr. Krawchuk's supervision.\n\n5. I do not believe that it will be possible to obtain satisfactory lump sum tenders on this project from any contractor. Further, I am of the opinion that the cost of the work would be excessive if done on a cost plus fixed fee basis. It is, therefore, recommended that the work be undertaken by Indian Affairs as a straight day labour project utilizing the foreman recommended by Mr. Davis and that instructions be issued to Mr. Krawchuk to supervise the work. Mr. Krawchuk was, before joining the Indian Affairs staff, a capable building contractor and it is felt that under his supervision the work can be carried out in a satisfactory manner and completed at a reasonable cost.\n\nSgd.

W. Perrie.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe - New roof - Pine Creek Residential School,\nCamperville, Manitoba.\n\nWe would be pleased to construct a new roof on the above school on the basis of cost plus a fixed fee of FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ($1,500.00).\n\nWe submitted an approximate estimate last October. Since then the cost of labor and material is much higher and conditions indicate it will rise more in the near future. Also there is uncertainty of how much existing material may be used in the new work and of the availability of local labor. A lump sum tender would have to be high to cover these contingencies. We suggest it would be more economical to do the work on a cost plus fixed fee basis.\n\nWe built the new Valley Hotel at Swan River and we have a fair idea of local conditions. We feel we have the engineering background and construction experience to do this work economically.\n\nWe remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBOLTON CONSTRUCTION CO. LTD.\n\nPer\n\nG. H.

Perrie,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\n416 Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Perrie:\n\nFurther reference to your letter of June 24, 1950, re new roof - Pine Creek Residential School, Gasserville, Manitoba. It is very difficult at the present time to get anyone in Winnipeg to undertake a contract as they are all busy repairing homes damaged by the flood. You might request a price from Arlington Builders, 1040 Arlington St., Winnipeg. This is the only firm that I can think of that would be interested.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. Krawchuk. While Mr. Krawchuk would not have time to stay on the job, owing to the building of schools and other work, if a foreman was hired he would make period trips and check on his work. If you feel that this would be the best way to do it let me know and I will try to locate a foreman. I have one in mind, a Mr. McKenzie, Portage la Prairie. He wants $1.75 an hour on an eight hour day basis and he would also take another qualified carpenter with him at $1.45 per hour.\n\nI am sorry I was not able to answer this letter sooner but I was out of the city. Kindest regards,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. R.S. Davis\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF\n\nNEW BOON, PINE CREEK RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, CAMPERVILLE, MAN.\n\nIn a memorandum dated June 26th I advised you that the following contractors had been requested to submit tenders on the above project on the basis requested in your memorandum of May 16th:\n\nMr. Marcel Lepere,\nSt. Rose du Lac, Manitoba.\n\nHolton Construction Co., Ltd.,\n1206 Wolseley Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nMr. A.

This type of saw is very necessary when repairing the roof at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School and should be purchased at once. The saw will save a great deal of time and labour and bring down the cost. It will eventually pay for itself. When the roof of the Pine Creek School is finished the saw can be used for other projects.\n\nLuks Electric, Winnipeg, have quoted a price of $108.80 on an electric power saw and Ashdown's have quoted a price of $140.25 less 2\u00bd. The cheaper one will be satisfactory for our needs.

This drill is very necessary as there are 3000 holes to drill through a 2\" stock. If it is not supplied it would mean doing the work by hand which would be very expensive and slow. The drill can be used for other purposes on other jobs from time to time. As the season is getting late it is necessary that the drill be forwarded to Camperville as soon as possible.\n\nIt is also necessary to have one 2\u00bd\" split ring groover at a cost of $41.50 quoted by Manitoba Bridge Company, Winnipeg. The 2\u00bd\" groover can also be rented at $11.00 a month and $3.60 per month thereafter. A 4\" split ring groover is also necessary which would cost $30.50 and the renting of same would be $7.00 a month and $2.40 per month thereafter.

She intimates that an agreement has been reached between the Department and the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, whereby the children of the Waterhen Reserve, who were pupils in the Residential School, are transferred to the Waterhen Day School. I have not received any advice regarding this transfer, and would be pleased to be informed. A copy of the letter received from the Indian and a copy of my reply are enclosed herewith.

If the Principal of the Pine Creek School has no objection the Department would favourably consider granting the discharge of the Nepinak children from the Pine Creek School on the understanding that they would regularly attend the Waterhen River Day School. If, however, the Principal requires these children it is considered that they should be returned to Pine Creek.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nR. A.

Clearsky, is over the age of 16.\n\nNo application for retaining this girl in your school appears to have been received and in this connection I wish to direct your attention to circular letter of July 21, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAs pointed out in the circular letter the Department realizes that frequently there are reasons for keeping certain children after they reach the age of 16 but at the same time the consent of the Superintendent General (Minister) must be obtained.\n\nI may add that in the past the Department has been favourably disposed to allowing certain pupils, especially girls, to remain in residential schools after they reach the age of 16 if good reasons for such action are given by the Principal and approved by the Indian Agent. However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. C. Ruest, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupil mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJanuary 4, 1940\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Pine Creek Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name ...............................................................\nAge ...............................................................\nName of Band ...............................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid ...............................................................\nFather's full name and No. ...............................................................\nMother's full name and No. ...............................................................\nParents living or dead ...............................................................\nState of child's health ...............................................................\nReligion ...............................................................\nDoes applicant speak English? ...............................................................\nPreviously attended ...............................................................\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parents or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

The father has been living with another woman for the past two months, the mother returning to her original reserve. During my recent visit to the Shoal River Reserve this matter was straightened out and the man has left to persuade his wife to return. I would call the Department's attention to the application of Amelia. This girl is only six years old, but under the circumstances should be admitted to boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo enclosing application for the admission of three children to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. The inference in your letter is that it is likely that the father and mother will be re-united. Under these circumstances the Department does not see any reason for placing the children in a residential school as there is a day school on the Shoal River Reserve. I should appreciate hearing further from you before making a definite decision regarding the application for their admission to the Pine Creek School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

I have on file a letter dated September 9, 1939, which reads as follows:\n\n\"By Department letter dated the 5th instant, File 126 - 1 - 10, the undermentioned children may be retained at school for another year\":\n\n- 0203 Olive Flett Discharged on Sept. 30, 1939.\n- 0190 Mary J.

There are seven paid on this ticket, man, woman, two boys and three girls. One boy and two girls are in the school at the present time, leaving a girl (Bella) two years and a boy (Jim) eight months. I am informed that these children were taken away from the reserve by their mother and are residing with her. I have tried to ascertain if the parents are now living together again without success up to this time. The mails to Shoal River Reserve have been stopped temporary on account of ice conditions and it will not be possible to visit this reserve until the ice goes out of Lake Winnipegosiss.\n\nDuring my last visit to the Shoal River Reserve, Kematch was living with another woman, his wife had left previously for Duck Bay taking the children with her. The older children were placed in the school, - a letter from the Rev. Principal attached. The illicit union was broken up and the man sent to Duck Bay to find his wife and family and bring them back to the reserve. The man left the Shoal River reserve with this intention, fished in the vicinity of Duck Bay until the end of the fishing season to obtain sufficient funds to enable him to return home and to date I have received no advice as to his return to Shoal River. It is not unlikely that the man will trap in the area between Camperville and Pelican Lake, returning to the reserve when the lake breaks up. I have written the reserve for further information and as soon as\nthis is received, the Department will be duly advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n## DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |                       |\n\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |                       |\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Education,\nIndian Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Roland Roulette,\n\nThe above is an orphan boy, ten years of age, who has been in the Camperville Mission School for the past five years. The grandfather of this child, who is his guardian, was in to see me today with advice that he fears unless this boy is removed from this school, something serious may happen to the child. It appears that the boy suffers from a kidney disorder which causes him to urinate during the night and instead of the child being treated medically for the trouble, he is whipped. This whipping and other forms of punishment, I am informed, has been going on for some considerable time. Just recently the boy ran away from the school and was found 30 miles from the village of Camperville.\n\nThe grandfather, Mr. McAuley, lives at Crane River, Manitoba, an Indian reservation in the Dauphin constituency and is not only willing, but anxious to take the boy, give him a home and education. I know Mr. McAuley very well. His home is about 200 yards from a fairly good public school, and I can see no reason whatsoever why the child's education would not be just as well taken care of at Crane River, and where he would be with his own relatives who would\nhave a more sympathetic understanding of his physical weakness and do something about having it corrected. I am not familiar with the routine requirements in affecting a transfer of a child from a Mission School to a public school, but I have no hesitation at all in assuring you that the child would be well taken care of if returned to his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. C. McAuley at Crane River, Manitoba.\n\nI would appreciate your looking into this matter at your early convenience and if a transfer is to be affected, it would be well to do so before winter sets in.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWJW/RF.\n\nJ. Ward, M.P.\nOctober 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the September quarter return of the Pine Creek School you may inform the Principal that the admission of Gertrude Clearsky is approved.\n\nThe discharge of the pupils numbered as follows is also approved:\n\nNo. 172\n\" 198\n\" 230\n\" 240\n\" 0274\n\nThe usual application form and certificate of health should be forwarded for Walter Lynxleg, No. 251.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOctober 24, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Ward:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant applying for the discharge of Roland Roulette from the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nI have carefully noted the information that has been given to you regarding the alleged treatment which this boy has received at the Pine Creek School and I am arranging to have this complaint investigated immediately and will write to you later when I receive a report.\n\nWhen he was admitted to the Pine Creek School in 1935 the Indian Agent wrote as follows:\n\n\"Roland Roulette -- 5 years old -- both parents are dead and the child has been in the care of his grandparents who are non-treaty. The child is not getting the necessary care and I recommend that admission be authorized.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW.J. Ward, Esq., M.P.,\nDauphin, Man.\nOctober 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA request has been received for the discharge of Roland Roulette from the Pine Creek Residential School and in writing to us our informant states:\n\n\"The grandfather of this child, who is his guardian, was in to see me today with advice that he fears unless this boy is removed from this school, something serious may happen to the child.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Roland Roulette.\n\nI am sorry that you have this inconvenience. I am pleased to give you all the information that I can so you can apportion any blame and suggest proper remedies.\n\nThe boy's condition-\n\nHe is eleven years old\u2014weighs 68 lbs and is in good physical condition. Parents dead. He wets bed at times\u2014His grandfather told him he would grow out of this\u2014he has not just done so. In my opinion a long foreskin is causing some irritation and this may be a part cause and in my opinion a circumcision should be done. This will help to remedy his condition to a certain extent. There is no kidney trouble. Whipping is not a cure and he is not whipped for this condition. The Father in charge of this school very rarely if ever approves of whipping. The Sister Superior never whipped this boy ever. The boy was whipped once by his teacher\u2014he said he was bad and that the teacher did not whip him very hard.\n\nThe boy left school because he was lonesome\u2014he told me so and he also told Constable Hanna the same. This boy left school with three other boys\u2014came to Winnipegosis\u2014were picked up by Constable Hanna\u2014given food and taken back to school. No boy left school because of whippings\u2014Their reason was that they...\nwere lonesome. This boy had not been whipped this term before he ran away. The bed wetting and whipping received the grandfather evidently knew about and had opportunities to discuss this with the Father in charge but evidently had not done so. I believe the grandfather has thought that something terrible must have happened to cause the boys to run away. There is no foundation for this supposition.\n\nThe boys were lonesome. There were also some weddings back home and that suggested good times for a day or two.\n\nThe solution.\n\nThe boy is a fine boy. He tells me he does not want me to send him home to stay but would like me to send him home when he is lonesome. He wants to go to school till he is fourteen years old. That's where he should be.\n\nThe guardian should give permission for circumcision which will help him some. I think, Mr Hoey, you have been troubled by a grandfather who knows you do not know him otherwise he would likely have reported to the Indian Agent. I do not know this man - I would like to have had a talk with him.\n\nI trust I have given you sufficient information for the proper disposal of this case.\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nA.B.Medd\n\nIndian Affairs.

Living is every bit as precarious. I am well acquainted with the grandfather, (Mr. McAuley) and am positive from various contacts with this man that the welfare of his grandchild is not the main consideration. This boy has now a few dollars in the bank at Ottawa and if the boy was allowed home, this money would be requested and in a short time further requests would be made for a monthly allowance for the keep of the boy. The funding of the boy's money has been a source of annoyance to Mr. McAuley, who considers this money his because he is the boy's guardian.\n\nI do not know what form Doctor Medd's report to the Department will take. I do wish to state, however, that I am certain the boy was never whipped for bed wetting. Neither the Principal nor the Sister Superior are the kind of persons who would abuse a child for a physical ailment. The Sister Superior is a motherly woman of wide experience whom the children love. The feeling of the children for the superiors is obvious as soon as one enters the school. I am positive the grandfather wants this boy only to use as a lever to obtain, from the Department, benefits for his own use.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 21, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Ward:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 11th ultimo and my replies of the 24th ultimo and 5th instant in regard to Roland Roulette, a pupil of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Mr. J.

I am not able to do any copying nor heavy lifting. Dr Sharman Burgess whom has examined me and told me I had chest trouble.\n\nNow my reason for writing is this. I have a boy at Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Comperville Man. Who will be fifteen this coming June 17th. I would be very thankful if you could discharge this boy from school right away and let him come home & work for me. I do not like the idea of having to be one the returned from the Dept. As I have fine good horses which I could put to use if I had someone with me. I have not the money to hire a man steady. Also I have tried to make a go of it myself but I am unable to do so. I am getting rather a bit discouraged and weak.\n\nIndian Affairs.

All Shingoose has to do is to arrange to go to Russell with Dr. Sharman some day and have an X-ray taken, and he has not yet done so, though I advised him to do so weeks ago. It is quite possible that if that diagnosis is correct, hospital treatment would affect a cure. The boy Michael, has had very little education and I do not recommend his discharge from school until his father takes steps to be X-rayed, and if necessary treatment. If that is done and he actually requires the boy then, which is quite possible, his discharge could be arranged.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nFebruary 11, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.

The putting of these children into the Residential School is not for educational, financial or sickness reasons, but entirely for immoral reasons.\n\nMrs. Alex Catcheway has for several years made and sold home-brew. Repeatedly quarrelled with her husband to the extent of endeavoring to separate from him.\n\nThe husband, of course, is not blameless. He also drinks and is not a good provider, although a good hunter. He spends too much money in gambling. This past Summer and again at the present time, he gave his wife to his brother. I understand that she is still living with this man, while her husband is elsewhere.\n\nThe putting away of the children is solely to facilitate their immoral living.\n\nMrs. Catcheway claims she is too sick to keep her children. Dr. Medd has repeatedly asserted that there is nothing wrong with her. She also states that her husband does not provide for his family. There is no reason for his not doing so.\n\nRev. Father C. Huest, O.M.I., Principal of the Pine Creek School, is willing to return these children at my request. But I feel it is for the Department to take the Decision.\n\nIf I request their return the mother will worry me constantly with her complaints of being too sick to care for them, and being unable to support them. My knowledge that she is being quite untruthful will not prevent the continuous annoyance.\nOn the other hand, if I let these children go, I shall not be in a position to refuse others. I have another healthy young mother who, at intervals, declares that her little children are too much trouble and wishes to put them away.\n\nIt would seem to be a new fashion for young parents to give away their children and partners as soon as possible.\n\nI was not aware that the Indian Treaty agreed to completely raise all children of healthy Indians. This would appear unreasonable to the taxpayers.\n\nI feel that by allowing children under such circumstances to enter a Residential School, we are encouraging parents in their immoral living. Besides these two cases we have another couple living together unmarried and raising children.\n\nIt maybe argued that such homes are unfit for children. True; but it seems to me that to relieve such parents of all responsibilities of raising their families we are not only encouraging them, but are actually assisting them in their unlawful way of life.\n\nIf such conditions are permitted to continue, the moral effect on the younger generation will eventually be disastrous. Conditions among the young folks are already bad.\n\nBefore removing Donald Catcheway's name from my school register I shall respectfully await the Department's decision in the case.\n\nI remain yours respectfully,\n\nSister Patricia, T. O. S. F.\nTeacher.\nMr. [illegible] -\n\nWould like you to read this letter and return.

I have carefully considered your letter and I feel it is unnecessary for me to state that the officials deeply deplore the action of some of the parents in neglecting their children in the manner mentioned in your letter. However, the officials of this Division have always felt that in spite of what the parents may do it is our duty to provide for the best interests of the children. With this in mind we feel that if either or both parents are not carrying out their duty it is, in most cases at least, in the best interests of the children to place them in a residential school where they will receive the care that they require.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of extending to you my best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Patricia, T.O.S.F.,\nTeacher,\nWaterhen River Indian Day School,\nSkowman, Man.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSeptember 1, 1944.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Pine Creek Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child .......................................................\nEnglish name ..............................................................
