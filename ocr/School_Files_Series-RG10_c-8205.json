On two occasions three men at one time and two at another remained around the school, wrestling for some time, after in this condition they call at my door something to eat.\nOnce since I have been here I was obliged to fire two shots from my window almost at midnight \u2014 A hoarse, abysmal sound came up to my door and there knocked harshly several times \u2014 I sat there ready to collapse with fear \u2014 then I picked up courage went to the window and fired two shots \u2014 The rascal never spoke while he was knocking, the lamp was burning and he stood in the light outside plainly through the cracks of the door and at the same time if he had known it a quarter inch would have opened the door as there was nothing holding it but two short screws in a ten or fifteen cent lock \u2014 the night itself would scare you, it being dark as dungeon, snowing, blowing, raining etc., For this reason I was, and am, I might say all the time about scared to death, living alone in such an isolated place behind such poor locks etc. Where, if the door and windows were open and our house would not almost die of fear when they would knock which is quite often \u2014 After enduring that awful midnight fright I sought for another side door, two strong bolts, two cases of dynamite and four locks on the two windows \u2014 Recently I have had shutters made for my windows, to let out\none from the inside, which will be a great protec-\ntion to cold and burglars, also\u2014When I get\nthe storm-door it shall not be thought we do\nnot need to sleep any longer with our clothes\non.\n\nBelieving, if it is worth one dollar a year\nto remain here, it certainly is worth five hundred\nat the very least and I shall be perfectly satisfied\nat present, with a pair of one hundred a year.\nShould keep a companion if I had four hundred a\nyear\u2014So you and an opinion of my situation.\nThe Indians who live by the side of this road, when\nthey go out a hunting or fishing expedition re-\nmain at their house and families together, so as to remain during their absence.\n\nSam, Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nAmos Kelso\nOttawa, December 6th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated October 15th, which reached the Department only on the 4th instant, asking for the reasons stated therein that your salary be increased from $300.00 to $400.00 per annum.\n\nIn view of the rather unsatisfactory attendance at this school the Department would like to know whether, in your opinion, the giving of a simple mid-day meal to the children would prove an inducement to them to attend more regularly, and, if so, whether you would be willing to prepare such a meal with the assistance of the older girls in the school.\n\nIn several Indian schools in the Northern part of the Province the Department provides material for the purpose of teaching the Indian girls the making of simple garments. When completed this clothing is given to the most deserving pupils and the Department would like to know whether you would be willing to undertake work of this nature.\n\nIf the attendance could be increased by the means indicated and if you would undertake the instruction in sewing the Department would be disposed to grant you the increase asked for to date from October 1st, last.\n\nThe Department will be glad to hear from you in reference to these matters at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Annie Kehoe,\nTeacher,\nMississauga, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

I cannot see why this should not be a reason for the children to attend more regularly. The school is open now, at the present time the attendance will be good, whereas the new year comes, I fear they will go away back to the same old habits in the spring. I am sure you can maintain this good. I sincerely hope I may be mistaken, the food and the simple garments will be a great encouragement and may possibly aidly right along. I have often asked the child went present, why such and such a child was\nand in school, the reply would be she has no\nmore or he has no place in the house no\nmatters what your armchair would teach me\nhow to make little pictures.

The object in giving these supplies is to supplement the lunches brought by the children themselves, not to provide a full meal, and I may say that in other day schools the cost is about two cents per meal per pupil. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to purchase fewer supplies.\n\nAs soon as the statement asked for in the letter above referred to is received you will be authorized to make further purchases.\n\nIn reference to the teacher's desk and chair I beg to say that these were ordered at the same time as the new pupils' desks in September last, and the Department has not as yet been able to ascertain whether the order was placed by the Agent, or whether some mistake was made in the shipment.

Feb. 14th, I got 60 loaves @ .05\n\" 2/25 \" 25 \"\n\nOn Feb. 12th & 23rd, I received a letter from the\nDepartment, stating that I must not make any\nfurther expenditure till the Dept. authorized\nmy request, which I did not, nor will not.\nThough, I have kept the mid-day meal going daily\nwith what I had on hand along with vegetables, etc.,\nthat I gave myself to make up the meals to date.\nI have on hand tea, sugar, mustard and salt to\ndo for another while but am completely out of pork,\nlard and beans.\n\nMy reason for keeping\nthe meal going is this. Eleven pupils, who had\nbeen in the school since last October, started to\nschool on Monday A.M. the 21st, and I wanted\nto do my little utmost to keep them in school. It\nis an unusual thing for these Indians to come\nhome this time of year. They do not generally come\ntill about the 1st July.\n\nSome of the families of the children have thanked\nme sincerely for the good meal. I give their children.\nI told them all thanks was due to the Dept. they\ncertainly do appreciate it. Yet I gave them all they\ncould eat, every day at the mid-day meal but some\nwere sick and thank me over. They are getting to be real\nspicy little fellows, for instance, they will say, Miss Rebe,\nwould you please give me a little more sugar in my tea. All\nsuch assertions which I really enjoy to see them bright en-\nough to make such remarks. Before this meal, quite an\na grand opportunity of teaching the pupils table etiquette, though\nthey may not practice it.\nNext week I expect I shall have an attendance of from twenty to thirty, therefore, it will take no small amount of supplies should I have that number.\n\nWe have nine simple garments finished, they all look neat and comfortable (if I might say so). The following are the ages of the children who are wearing the garments to school every day, also three pairs of mittens finished and being worn to school. 5 years, 9 years, 12 years, 7 years, 10 years, 11 years, 11.\n\nI have yet on hand two yards of flannel, not enough to make a garment.

The object of the Department is to supplement the lunches brought by the children themselves, not to provide a full meal. This also will make the work lighter for yourself. The Department thinks you might discontinue the purchase of bread, or at least a very limited quantity. Your letter shows that in one week you gave out twenty loaves. It is thought that the parents should provide this article of diet.\n\nYour accounts show that you have purchased in all forty-five yards of flannelette since January and the Department would like to know whether you made underclothes or dresses with this material. If you think it advisable a further supply will be authorized.\n\nIt is the wish of the Department to keep the\n\nMiss Annie Kehoe,\nTeacher,\nBlind River, Ont.\naccounts and records for the sewing material and mid-day meal supplies separate, and you will be good enough to have them rendered separately in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nMinesota, Ont.

If they could attend school as White children do, some of them would do very nicely.\n\nIn school they are real pleasure to me; another, they do not believe in imparting their knowledge to others.\n\nIn school hours I teach English only.\n\nDuring recreation, I cannot trust the children out of my sight.

Kelsoe\nTeacher Mininanga\n\nDear Miss,\n\nI visited the Mininanga Indian school yesterday and was more than surprised to find the school locked up and no person there although it was during school hours. I would have been pleased to have met you; the Department has written me to purchase a dish pan, a stove lifter, and a pail for the school, and no further expense will be allowed. I also heard a report that you were selling things to the Indians such as cigars, cigarettes, etc., and that you had allowed the boys to shoot at a target on the Sabbath day at 5 o'clock. Now I do hope these reports are not true, for your own sake and others as well. I may say that if you sell a cent worth of anything to the Indians you are breaking the law.\n\nI will be down again soon and if it is done...\nMEMO\n\nDuring school hours I hope to find you in the school house attending to your duties. Kindly let me know how many you had at school on the two last days of this week on the 4th and 5th of March.\n\nI have the honour to be yours respectfully,\n\nJ. Hayan\n\nJ. A.\nI am informed that you have the children working at various things around the school instead of being at their studies; they do not go to school to work but to learn to read and write and other things, and that is what you are paid to learn them not to set them to work. I have told my son not to do anything attend to his lessons.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Dyke's writing and probably the composition.\nWinnepeg, Oct. 25th 1910.\n\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI have been disappointed in my expectations. I presume the early breakup had something to do with it, whether mid-day meal and the simple garments.\n\nMost of the Indians with their wives and families left here on the A.M. of the 14th, for what I supposed to be an absence of two months or thereabouts. To my great surprise they all returned on the 22nd, and today the school is full of children. I have all arrangements made to take this care for them, my disappointment is little imagined than described.\n\nSince January 1909, school has been in operation without taking any holidays. For the last six months, I taught Saturday and holidays, Sundays and holidays, so the former I taught for the sake of the children, in the latter I had religious instruction.\n\nToday, I was speaking to the Chief, he told me they were all going away again but he thought most of the women would remain at home with the children so that they could attend school.\n\nOn the 3rd and 10th, a number of the pupils made their first Communion; they did it so neatly that it has made a great impression upon the parents. At all times the Indians think a great deal more of their church than the school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am at a loss to know what it might be. Probably if I knew I might be tempted to pack. They know perfectly well that when the Indians money is spent on the school they cannot get, and I presume, this is the reason they are interfering so much. They have no influence whatever over the present Chief, but are doing things very almost to have him sent out and in this strand put by Wahonahang or (Maningota in English) the latter will do anything for them.\n\nEnclosed please find a note I received from through John Dyke's influence. I think I shall send ahead some of the letter which I wish you to read, so as not to take up too much of your precious time, should I call. I will remain here till May 24th, and by that time I shall know if the funds are going to remain or not and if they are I shall not go.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is recognized that no teacher can expect, under ordinary circumstances, to please all the parents of children attending the school and great tact is needed to successfully carry out your work.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the holidays have been noted and it is pleasing to learn that the Indians are sufficiently interested in the welfare of their children to leave them at home rather than take them with them on their hunting trips, and as soon as you have finally decided to\n\nMiss Annie Kehoe,\nTeacher,\nBlind River, Ont.\ndelay your vacation till the usual time authority will be given for a further expenditure for a mid-day meal.\n\nIt would be a great convenience to the Department if you could, when making your report, show in tabular form, from the first of the year, the number of meals served and the money expended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI beg leave to say that I have had a great number of complaints laid against the teacher at Mississauga, Miss Annie Rehe. Madore Boyer is the principal complainant, he says, that when she makes out her quarterly school report she puts fictitious names on to make believe she has a large school here as a number of children who have not been to school for a long time, not since last December. Frank Dabberton 5 children, Pahwaiwaitting 3 children, Sahshabick 1, Shamogam 2, Paigowinisi 1, Sabrech 2, Madore Boyer 3. He also reported that there were only about 3 or 4 Indian children going to school. I have not visited the school as often as I would like. For this reason I went once to visit the school during school hours and the teacher was not at the school house nor any pupils. I drove on and called at the Hudson Bay store to enquire if they knew why there was no school while I was there some of school children came in and told me they were in the church. The children said they saw me at the school house but could not say whether the teacher saw me or not.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI may in passing say that I was informed that the teacher had candies and cigars and other little things and was selling them to the children or anyone who would buy. I told her she must not do that. I understand she quit that and took to buying furs. I had to stop her again. She had bought between 30 and 40 beaver hats since she quit. I am very sorry to have to write anything about a woman, I am saying as little as possible, but I have her own little to prove that she tells lies.

They have complained to the Indian Agent here, Mr. Samuel Hagen, but fear that the Agent could not have reported to you as they received no reply and nothing has been done.\n\nIn the first instance this young lady is receiving $100.00 to feed the Indian children, while the Indians are quite able and willing to feed their own children and would much prefer to do so. As a matter of fact she has not been doing it and has been receiving the $100.00 for nothing.\n\nThey also complain that this teacher has not been doing her duty towards the children in not keeping the school open during the time of year when all regular schools are running. It seems that she closes the school and goes away on holidays whenever it pleases her. There were other times that the teacher was engaged with other parties in the school, during school hours, and had the door locked so that the children could not get in and they were exposed to the cold.\n\nThere are a great many other complaints and the\nI. Dept.\n\nIndians ask that this teacher be removed. They have requested Mrs. Dyke to intervene on their behalf.\n\nMrs. Dyke is well known to some of the members of your Department. Mr. Campbell and Mr. Chittie, the timber inspector are both acquainted with Mrs. Dyke. She is a lady who has the respect of the whole community and has always taken a deep interest in the affairs of the Indian on the Mississaga Reserve. They go to her with all their troubles, and for that reason she has come to me on their behalf, requesting me to write you and place the matter before you.\n\nThere seems to be some friction between the Indians and the Missionary, the Rev. Father Richards, over the school teacher. They have asked the Reverend gentleman to have her removed but it appears that he wants her to stay.\n\nAt present there is a very strong feeling against the young lady. They say that she has been receiving money from the Department in the name of some of the Indian women, when in reality the money has been for herself, the others having nothing to do with it. They do not get the money that is provided for the scrubbing of the school and matters of this kind, in fact they have not been doing that work, and have given the young lady no authority to use their names in getting money from the department for the work done.\n\nThere are a great many complaints of this kind. In\nfact it would fill a large volume; I am only reciting a few of them so that you can understand the feeling against this young lady teacher. In order to discover the truth or falsity of these statements it would be necessary to have a man on the ground to investigate. As matters stand I am afraid that this teacher's usefulness among the Indians is much retarded.\n\nI may further say that owing to the fact that the Indians bring their complaints to Mr. & Mrs. Jno. Dyke, there is considerable friction between these people and the Indians and some very hard things have been said by the teacher against Mr. and Mrs. Dyke, which charges Mr. and Mrs. Dyke repudiate as being altogether without foundation. Of course, I cannot enter into full particulars of this matter and tell you all that is being said as it requires a man on the ground to fully understand the position of affairs. Mrs. Dyke does not intend to be slandered over this matter and feels very strongly the statements that have been made by the teacher and desired the Department to know the full circumstances. If an Inspector is sent up, have him go to Mrs. Dyke who will fully inform him.\n\nI may say that in all matters of this kind it has been customary to send letters to you through the Indian Agent and it would be my desire to do so in this case but for the fact that the Indians say that they have forwarded so many complaints to the Agent, about which they have heard nothing, they think\nJ.

The day I started at Blind River all Indians before the Mississaugas Indians were all home about six o'clock. This assertion is a true one, supposing I did remain in school for the month of May and June. However, I would have been alone the greater part of the time. I am sure that Mr. Dyke's words are accurate. Our good agent accuses me for stealing, cheating, etc. However, they did as much of that sort as themselves during their life time. They judge his behavior. The Chief (John Barner) is still after me. John Dyke wants the Indians to lock me out the first chance they get. I have been told Mr. Dyke has made an awful threat against me\u2014 I have heard him myself.\n\nPoor Copy\nmake such remarks but the poor woman now is insane at times. I do not fear Dykes at all but nevertheless there is no knowing what may take place. Mr. Dyke said a man with the drug store at Blind River, a few days ago to buy for her a drug to pitch in a man's face to blind and burn his face for life. The druggist would not sell the drug.

He came over in the afternoon and we arranged to leave for Mississauga on Monday noon. We took the train to Blind River where we got a horse and buggy and drove out to the Mississauga Reserve about five miles.\n\nThe school on the reserve is in charge of Miss Annie Kehoe and was in session when we arrived there. There were 8 children present, 5 boys and 3 girls. All the children were very backward in their studies, only one boy being able to read at all and the other children in the a b c class. The school-house was scrupulously clean and well equipped. The register showed that there are 33 pupils on the roll, but the attendance is very irregular and the average varied from 10 to 17 during the year.\n\nA family named Dyke, who live on the borders of the reserve and keep a small trading post, are very bitter against Miss Kehoe, especially Mrs. Dyke, who employed a lawyer at Thessalon to write to the Department asking for her dismissal on certain stated grounds. I tried to get\nat the bottom of the trouble and came to the conclusion that these charges were based on the personal dislike of Mrs. Dyke for Miss Kehoe. They are both hot headed Irish women and are very bitter against each other. Miss Kehoe is a confirmed old maid and set in her ways and does not think that Mrs. Dyke has any business to interfere with her. The Dykes have lived there for a number of years and have a good deal of influence with the Indians who deal with them and Mrs. Dyke thinks that Miss Kehoe's presence on the reserve interferes with her interests and her peace of mind and wants her removed. Miss Kehoe admitted having dickered with the Indians and I warned her to cease this practice. Mrs. Dyke said some pretty hard things about Miss Kehoe's character, but on making careful inquiries I was unable to find anyone who would substantiate her statement. Miss Kehoe and the Agent do not pull well together. Mr. Hagan is an Orangeman and Miss Kehoe is a Roman Catholic and is backed up by Father Richard and the Bishop. Miss Kehoe is not much of a teacher, but it would be a difficult matter to get a better one to live on the reserve.\n\nAs a result of my visit I do not think that the Department would be justified in dismissing her to gratify the Dykes and I think Mr. MacKay, who also visited the reserve a short time before I was there, will bear me out.\nBlind River, Ont.\nDec. 20th, 1910.\n\nSir:\n\nMight I ask how many holidays we are supposed to have at Christmas and if the Department would let me teach during this time and add the same to my summer holidays or annual leave?\n\nAnnie Kehoe\nOttawa, December 24, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and in reply to the last paragraph I beg to say that the Department considers it advisable to give the children of your school at least a weeks holidays at this particular time of the year.

On Wednesday April 27th I remained in school from 9 o'clock A.M. to 3 P.M., with not any pupils present and at 3 o'clock I left school for Rhind River, that same evening I met our noble Agent Hayne on the street in an intoxicated state, he told me he had just come from mission and found the school locked, I told him I did not have any pupils that day so I left at 3 P.M. I also told him it would be a good time for me to go on my annual leave, as I would be alone the greater part of the time for the next 2 months anyhow. No! he said I could not get permission from Mr. Smith, as it should make no much extra work for him, change his whole routine etc., and that it did not matter to me whether there was a child in school or not as long as I kept in my time.\n\nThe side that I was last operated on is all healed up except a spot about the size of a 50\u00a2 piece and I surely think that by Sept. 1st this will be healed. Supposing it is not, for better or for worse, I shall go to mission camp and try again school on Sept. 1st, my health is perfect, if the ear would only be healed - no doubt it will be risky to go where there are so many germs as it is quite unhealthy.

The teacher at La Sable Reserve, who came to our school once to be taught how to teach make a time table etc., told me she had no pupils at school on August 15th, so the Reserve instead of in her father's home she would not even have had three pupils at the Agent Reserve. Supposing these families get third every year since I have been here, the Indians with their children off the Reserve about the end of Sept. or the 1st of Oct. and remain away till about Christmas or New Years, some of them return sooner.

They said they owed John Dyer land if they were to go against them they would be refused provisions etc.\ntherefore, the Department can plainly see, the poor Indians are obliged to do as they are asked, they are afraid to do otherwise \u2014 should any person fail to keep in the good graces of the Agent and Deputy, they too, will be in a lot of trouble, etc.\n\nThe School Inspector told a person at St. Mary's he would much rather not visit this school as he was afraid of losing his reputation \u2014 A professional person said they kept away as much as possible from the place in order to save their reputation.\n\nFrom the cradle to this day, God knows I bear a name without a stain!\nSince I came here Dykes have tarnished my reputation in such a way that it will follow me all the days of my life, for there are as many narrow-minded professors in the world as broad-minded ones and a person who loses their reputation through false reports, it is almost unbearable.\n\nDykes have gone so far as to make special calls on friends who resided at Blind River, and in each place did their utmost to blacken my character in such a way that I could not be received anywhere \u2014 through visits they were listened to in some places, in others they were ordered out, and in others they would not be allowed to tell their story.

Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nLast January at a meeting of the Indians in the school the Agent gave orders for the getting out of the wood for the school and the teacher's quarters \u2014 Eight cords at the very least were to be split up fine for the cooking stove, \"only poles were split,\" since, about\nI wrote Dyke in everything. I measured the wood when it was placed on the school ground and there was three cords short \u2014 The Indians who got out the wood were the ones who were paid to split the right cords etc. Therefore, they were paid before doing so and the pupils have had to split the wood \u2014 An Indian told me no one had any right to split the wood only those who got their pay before doing so and those Indians have not been on the Reserve since August to my knowing. It would not surprise me one bit if the Agent reported to the Dept. that the Indians disliked me as they would\n\nthe end of Sept or Oct 1st, the pupils have split all that has been used since though, I wrote the Agent in September or October telling him the wood for the cooking stove was about used up etc. As usual, he paid no attention until he visited the school on Nov. 22nd, he told me to tell the chief to see to the wood so I sent the message and whether he got it or not I do not know but the pupils are yet getting the wood for the cooking etc \u2014 The Agent left John Dyke to see to the measuring of the wood etc. Of course the Agent\nnot split the wood etc. The Dept. gave orders to the Agent in Sept. to have a well or spring cleaned out etc., he failed to do so. This last two or three weeks I have in school every day, fourteen to thirteen pupils, simply because the good Indians are returning from their trapping expeditions, they have not been staying out of school as has been reported because they dislike their teacher etc., as I have said before they do not stay out of school who on the Reserve in their homes.\n\nWhite people who have visited the school were delighted and surprised with the pupils, they are obedient, respectful and polite in every way.\nI do sincerely hope that my successor will not lose her reputation and position through false reports as your humble servant has.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had written a resignation to send in, when he first asked me to do so but did not send it, though, when I wrote it, there was so much disputing & felt as if I should resign.

Some false report it\nMemo has been spread and though Mr. Richard may only imagine it so he is afraid to say whether this is his reason or not. Now Mr. Hagan, I don't know what to do.

Father Richard was informed that Miss McGuey had not resigned her position as teacher of this school as far as the Department was aware, and she was expected to remain on another year, as the Department has no wish to lose her services. If Father Richard has any charges to make against Miss McGuey they should be put in writing and will be investigated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst' Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nTo Mr. J. D. McLean,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nImmediate\n\nOn the 29th of June I told Miss Lillian McGeary that on account of her bad conduct she could not retain her school at Mississauga. She promised to give up her scandalous life at once. Then I told her that, if she kept her promise, she could retain her school. She continued to conduct herself as before. On the 13th of July she told me that she had sent in her resignation to the Department through the Indian Agent on the 14th inst., the Department in a letter of the 20th, and the Indian Agent again on the 22nd, assured me that they had not received any intimation that Miss McGeary intended to resign; she persisted in saying that she had sent in her resignation until yesterday at last she admitted that she had not. Since she will not resign of her own accord, I will ask the Department to remove her from the Mississauga School. Such is the\nSt. Ignatius Church\nSteetton, Ont.\n\nwish of the Chief and all the Indians of Mississauga, who held a meeting in the latter part of June for the purpose of asking the Department to remove Miss M. Goy from her school on account of her scandalous life. I advised them to refer the matter to the agent on his coming visit on the 22nd of July for the payment of annuities. I might add here that it is also the wish of her own mother. She wrote to me on the 24th inst.: \"I never approved of my daughter keeping that school, when I heard how she was situated. I sincerely hope that you will use your influence that she will not get that school for another year. Lillian was too young and inexperienced in the world to hold such a position. I think she is not eighteen yet.\n\nSince nearly a year Miss M. Goy is keeping company with a young tramp, who makes her neglect her school very seriously. From January 1913 to May 1914 she spent her week ends at Mrs. Alphonse Berthelotte's at Blind River. Mrs. A. Berthellette lives now at the Hiawatha Hotel, Sault Ste Marie. And Mrs. Berthellette told me that Miss M. Goy closed her school and left for Blind River often on Friday.\nmorning, and sometimes as early as Thursday or even Wednesday; that very seldom she was back for her school before Monday noon, and often was back for her school only on Tuesday or Wednesday. Many times she would be a whole week away from her school. Indians told me that children who went to school on Monday morning in the winter, had to remain the whole forenoon shut out in the cold. The young man or tramp above mentioned came and spent every evening shut up in the school alone with Miss M. Goey. I saw him myself leaving the school as late as quarter to twelve at night. Indians tell me that she used to remain alone with him in the dark in her school, and wait till he would be gone to light her lamp. The young man often spent the whole day at the school, and, as the Chief remarked to me, it was then recess the whole day for the children. Mr. and Mrs. Berthelotte refused her all last admittance to their house, because Miss M. Goey would not give up keeping company till midnight with that young man. She gave dances at night in her school at least four times for young men and young girls of Blind River. In order to continue to keep...\ncompany with that young man, she has not gone home nor taken any vacation, but has secured a position as book-keeper in a butcher's shop in Blind River.\n\nSince I have experienced that Miss M'Coey is in the habit of lying and deceiving, and her sister, Mrs. Herbert A. Reilly, wife of the C.P.R. ticket clerk at Sault Ste Marie, told me that her sister Lillian had always the habit of lying and deceiving. I am inclined to think that Miss M'Coey may not have been overzealous in making out her quarterly reports; but of course it is impossible now to get at any data.\n\nI was at Mississauga from the 26th to the end of the month of June, and know from personal knowledge that Miss M'Coey left her school on Friday night, the 26th, and never came back to teach, but remained in Blind River till the end of the quarter. Now for the sake of curiosity you might look at her report for the two last days of the quarter, namely Monday and Tuesday, 27th and 30th of June, 1914.\n\nA teacher in a Catholic school should be, not only a nominal Catholic, but also a practical one, but Miss M'Coey is not. She was warned that both the Priest at Blind River and myself would refuse her the sacraments.\nof the Church, unless she gave up her scandalous life.\n\nShe has no teacher's certificate for Ontario.\n\nIf she will be late trying to get another school, it will be her own fault. I notified her in time that she had to give up her school.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYours truly,\nJ. R. Richard, S.J.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nLast month the Rev. Father Richard, Roman Catholic Missionary in charge of the north shore of Georgian Bay, wrote the Department asking if Miss McGoey, teacher of the Mississauga Indian School, had sent in her resignation. He was informed that she had not done so. Mr. Agent Hagan wrote the Department on the 28th ultimo enclosing a letter from Miss McGoey from which it would appear that some trouble had arisen between herself and Father Richard. Mr. Hagan was told that if the Priest had any complaints to make against the teacher they should be put in writing. Father Richard has now written the Department accusing Miss McGoey of neglecting her school and making grave insinuations against her character.\n\nMr. Hagan in his letter above referred to says, \"I am sorry to say that I do not believe a word of it. The lady in question is as good as gold. She has brought the school up from two children to nineteen and the Indians were well...\"\nwell pleased with her work, but they are superstitious and they are afraid of the Priest. He wants the lady to send in her resignation. I do not want to lose the teacher as she is the best in my agency and as far as I can find out the stories told are a tissue of falsehoods.\"\n\nIn view of these conflicting statements I think the matter should be investigated in justice to the teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Well Mr. Hagen, I have had rather a heavy doctor's bill to pay, and it has left me rather short, so I should be very much obliged to you, if you could send me the money which is due to me for the cleaning of the school, as it will help out quite a little. There should be 3 months coming, as I only received for the month of September. Since the beginning of this term, I have only had 3 pupils, and I must own the life is very monotonous out here, so I think I shall most likely send in my resignation a month before the Easter holidays, as it is playing very hard on my nerves, and the salary being so small, it does not allow me the necessary things after my board bills are paid.

He states that there are about 30 children of school age on the Reserve for whom no educational facilities are provided. He also states that if the local Clergy were allowed to recommend a teacher that there is no doubt a suitable one could be obtained.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report as to the advisability of re-opening this school. You should state the condition of the school building, and the equipment, such as desks, blackboards, etc., if any, that would be required, and what repairs would be required to put the building in good shape.\n\nYou might take up with the local Missionary the question of obtaining a suitable teacher, as it is most desirable that educational advantages be provided for the Indian children of this Reserve. We will be prepared to pay a fair salary, depending upon the qualifications which the teacher possesses.\n\nYou should give this matter your early attention in order that, if it is decided to re-open this school, time will be given to make any repairs, etc., required to the building and have it in condition by the 1st of September, next, when it is hoped that the services of a suitable teacher will be obtained.\n\nYou should also state what provision there is at this point for the accommodation of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

These amounts should cover the cost of the labour and the material necessary in removing the old paper and murescosing all the rooms, as well as cleaning the floors and placing the building in a good, sanitary condition.

The painting of the outside of the building, however, will depend upon the cost of having the work done.\n\nYou should submit the prices for the work mentioned as soon as possible, in order that it can be undertaken and completed before the end of August, next.

There is a teacher's residence provided, and we will have both the school and residence cleaned and put in good condition.\n\nIf you would accept the position as teacher at this school, you should communicate immediately with Mr. C. F. Rothera, Indian Agent, Thessalon, Ont. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $600 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

McLean,\nDeputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the 5th instant was duly received and advice therein noted. Many thanks for giving me an appointment in the Mississagwa Reserve. I may say I shall accept same and will report for duty September 5th. I have written the Indian Agent, Mr. Rothera, Thessalon, Ont. to that effect. I am sorry, owing to qualifications, that my application could not be considered for the Hunter's Point School, because having taught sixteen years in the Province of Quebec, four more years teaching there would entitle me to a pension. However, should my health stand the test of teaching again for any length of time, perhaps the department would kindly transfer me to said Province, should a suitable opening occur.\n\nThanking you again for kind consideration, I am\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nMost Respectfully yours,\n\nJean M. Bermott\nOttawa, July 12, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of June 20th, regarding the re-opening of the day school on the Mississauga Reserve. We have received an application for the position of teacher from Miss Jean McDermott, Sturgeon Falls, Ont., who was formerly a teacher and taught for a number of years at the Garden River R. C. Day School.\n\nWe are approving of the appointment of Miss McDermott, to begin duties on or about the 5th of September, next. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $600 per annum plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nIt is necessary to have this school and teacher's living quarters placed in good condition. I have, therefore, to request that you will submit the prices which you receive for the work mentioned in our letter of the 20th ultimo, as required for the placing of these buildings in good shape. Your early attention to this matter is requested, as the Department desires to have this work completed before the school opens in September, next.\n\nMiss McDermott states that she is communicating with you to the effect that she will accept the position as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, July 12, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, informing the Department that you will accept the position of Teacher of the Indian Day School on the Mississauga Reserve and that you will be prepared to commence duties on September 5th, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your appointment is approved, at the salary mentioned in our letter to you of the 5th instant. We are informing Mr. Agent Rothera accordingly, and requesting him to take immediate steps to have the building and teacher's living quarters placed in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Jean McDermott,\nSturgeon Falls,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter of July 12th by Oskate, but I have made inquiries in regard to school. If the Dept. are willing to have the school painted, I can obtain paint at $3 per gal. 6 gallons will do the school with 2 coats. I have also a letter which I am enclosing from a painter who offers to do the job by the day or by contract & furnish everything.\n\nHave seen the Hardware merchant here & they would supply paint at $3 per gal. Also varnish at $4 per 5 \"Package.\"\n\nIt would be cheaper & more convenient by the day, & we supply the material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Rotherm\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rothera\nIndian Agent\nThessalon\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived your letter and am sorry to say I made a mistake in my previous figures; it should have been $65.00. I did not notice it until I had your letter gone. If you have the material, I would advise you to let the job by the hour. I charge $60.00 per hour and furnish my own brushes or $400.00 for the job if you furnish paint and varnish.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nC. B. Belair\nOTTAWA, July 18th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the repairs required to the school and teacher's residence on the Mississauga Reserve, and enclosing an estimate of the cost of painting the building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be cheaper to supply the material and have the work done by day labour. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the paint, muresco and any paper required. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers before making the purchase, and the paint, etc., should be purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should arrange for competent labour to do the painting and the other decorating required to both the school and teacher's residence.\n\nProper time sheets should be kept for the men doing the work, and you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted. The time sheets for the labour should be forwarded, in duplicate, properly receipted.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of placing the school and teacher's quarters in good condition in your hands to make the best arrangements you can to have the work done by day labour, and at the lowest possible cost. The work should be completed by the end of August, next, in order that the school will be ready for occupation by the 5th of September, next, when it is proposed to re-open the school.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether any blackboard material, desks, etc., are required, or whether the quantity of these supplies on hand is sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She states that she hopes to be able to resume duties about the beginning of the new year.

She further stated that there are only fourteen double desks in the school and that, consequently, the room was very much overcrowded.\n\nMiss MacNulty considers that there are many more white children attending this school this year than formerly. Is this a fact and, if so, you might state the reason. She also advises that a number of white children in the immediate vicinity attend school in Blind River. Why is it not possible for all the white children to attend school there? If the figures given by Miss MacNulty are correct, there is only accommodation for the Indian children at the Mississauga River Indian Day School.\n\nIn your letter of November 15th, last, you stated that there were only 12 white children attending this school. The Department desires a report from you regarding the white children in attendance at the Mississauga River School. Please state the number of white children that have been attending during the present month and the number who will likely attend during the March quarter. You should, also, state the number of Indian children who have been attending during the present month and the number of these that will likely attend during the March quarter.\n\nPlease let me have the information requested in this letter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Concerning the heating of the teacher's living quarters, the Department is informed by the local Indian Agent that all teachers who have taught at this school for the last 10 years have found the present arrangements to be satisfactory and the living quarters comfortable. It is not recommended that a coal stove and coal be supplied.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, the Agent states the well, which is near the school, has been cleaned out and is ready for use, and he says, further, that all the requirements sufficient for a school are at Mississauga. Only last year, the Department made alterations to the living quarters, making them comfortable for the teacher.\n\nRegarding the attendance of white children, the Agent states that only 12 attended last month and he expects there will be the same number when the school re-opens. As long as there is accommodation, the Department desires that the white children attend and receive the regular classroom instruction and no white child should be refused admittance unless Mr. Agent Rothera approves.\n\nThe Department would be pleased to hear, at the earliest possible date, whether you intend to resume duties as teacher on the 4th proximo or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Miss MacNulty states there is seating accommodation for 25 pupils only, while there is a possible attendance of 25 Indian children. The report received for the December quarter, last, shows there was an average attendance of 19 Indian children. She states that she recently discussed this matter with you in the presence of Dr. Langlois. She also states that while only 12 white children attended, there was a further like number who had been sent home last fall and that there was also a still further number who could attend.\n\nThe question of continuing the attendance of white children at this school will have to receive serious consideration, and I have to request that you will state definitely the number of Indian children who have been attending each day since the school reopened on January 4th, last, and the total number who could attend. You can obtain this information from the teacher's register. You should also state the total number of white children in the neighborhood of the school who wish to attend regularly. You should state further the necessity for the attendance of white children. It is considered that if there are the number of children stated by Miss MacNulty they should establish their own school. The Department will expect you to give as full particulars as possible regarding the white children, together with our recommendation as to whether the white children should be refused permission to attend after, say, the end of the present school year - June 30th, next. Your early reply giving this information is requested.\n\nMiss MacNulty complains about the cold condition of the school. She states that some of the window sashes are half an inch away from the frames. If this is so, could you not arrange to have weather stripping placed around these windows?\n\nPlease state the distance of the well from the school.

There are seats in the school to accommodate 28 children, and the attendance has averaged 19 Indian children.\n\nMiss MacNulty gave me the names of 24 white children who could, and would like to attend our school, but the parents know that if there is not room for them, they will have to stop. I told Miss MacNulty in the presence of Dr Langlois to report to me when the school becomes crowded, and I will make room for our own children. These white children are living in the township of Cobden and the nearest school is Blind River, and am told that if these children were allowed to attend the Blind River School they would have to pay the Separate school Board $4.50 for each pupil a month.\n\nThere were 12 white children attending the school last fall, and Miss MacKitchen did not object neither did the teachers before, but were pleased to help those children who are really unfortunate in living where they are with no school to go to. Would recommend that the white children be allowed to attend the school, until our school is crowded, and then I will write or go and see the parents and know they will do what we ask.\n\nWill have the window sashes attended to.\n\nThe well is about 100 yards or so from the school.

Miss MacNulty, the teacher, is being informed accordingly. The arrangement that the white children continue to attend is for the balance of the present school year only. The continuance of permission for the white children to attend will have to receive consideration before the school reopens for the academic year beginning on or about September 1, 1933. I may say that this Department is under no obligation to provide school facilities for the white children. If you have an opportunity, you might discuss the matter with the leading members of the white families, informing them that it is doubtful if school facilities can be provided for their children after the present school year, and you should again refer this matter to the Department for final consideration early in August, next, giving, at that time, your opinion as to whether the privilege should be continued or not.\n\nIt is noted you are having the water in the well from which the school obtains its supply tested.

Robicheau,\nBatchewana Bay,\nOnt.\nJune 12th 1933\n\nMr. Phelan\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWill you please excuse me to come again (my previous letter was May 16th), and write to you about Mississauga's school-teachers, but I am doing it at the request of His Grace Our Bishop Scollard. Bishop Scollard is now visiting my missions, giving in the same time the sacrament of Confirmation. We were already in Mississauga, and His Grace asked me about the school-teachers. I told His Grace what I had told you before, adding perhaps that she is, most of the time, contrary to what says the missionary. His Grace then asked me to write you again, telling me to let you know that I was doing so under his suggestion.\n\nI myself also recommended me Miss Meadigan, whom he knows personally.\nand whom he thinks will be very good for this post, on account of her personal qualities, and also on account of her family's vicinity from Mississauga.\n\nAsking you again, dear Mr. Sheban, to excuse me, I remain\n\nReligiously yours in Christ\n\nFather Paul Redhomme\n\n322. Cathcart Street\nSainte Marie\nDear Mrs. Phelan,\n\nIn your recent letter of December 15th, you were asking me, that, if I was finding any strong objection to Miss Mac Neally, teacher in Mississauga, to let it be known to you.\n\nThis is what I think to be said about Miss Mac Neally.\n\nAbout the moral point of view, her conduct is perfect; but I will have some objection about her way of acting towards the children. She does not seem to have a very acute pedagogical and psychological sense. At my first visit, since she is back, I went as usual to school; the first very thing she did was to run down some of the pupils showing me their mistakes. I was very much surprised. On the other hand, I know positively that these same pupils were making some real efforts and doing their best.\nEverything there, according to her mind was bad; the hospitals in St. Regis (where she taught) were far better. If she had told me this privately, it would have been all right, but she was saying this before everybody in class, and of course this was repeated by the children to their parents. She does not seem to know what is to encourage these Indians, what is perhaps the most important with them.\n\nEverytime I went there she was always complaining about something; she is disgusted about the Indians; she does not want to use any food that an Indian would have touched, the comfort is not satisfactory, the government does not give her enough comfort... It is tiresome, everyone to hear her complains.\n\nI do not think Miss Mac Nally is fit to teach in our Indian Missions, I mean the lonely places, because she is not ready enough to accept the small sacrifices, and the abnegation required by the mission life.\n\nIt is true that her health seems pretty poor, she is often complaining about her throat, and the difficulty for her to teach and talk. Nevertheless, about what she told me, even when she was suffering from her throat, she continued to teach.\n\nI heard a few Indians telling their desire...\nto have another teacher; especially for this reason of not encouraging the children, and too easily saying here and there what she is thinking unfavorably about such a one or such another one.\n\nThey would be pleased to have again Miss McKitchen coming back; she was very popular, though most likely she had not the same value in science as Miss MacKainty. She was also able to make the children think sing. The little concert she had for Christmas time made a good impression on the Indians. She was certainly encouraging the children who were pleased to come to school.\n\nAnother school teacher, Miss Meadigan from Blind River told me also her desire to teach in Mississauga. The advantage would be perhaps that every week she would be able to go home. She is now teaching in Sprague and I think she is succeeding well. Having Miss Meadigan in Mississauga so close to Blind River, where her family is living, would give a certain guarantee for the moral...\nThis is dear Mrs. Kelan, what I might say about Miss Mac Nealy: her moral conduct seems to be perfect, but she is not fit for the teaching among the Indians, at least in the small missions, not encouraging them too particular, too difficult to please, wanting too much comfort...\n\nIt may happen that the school teacher in Batchewana leaves. Miss Sloane (or Sloan) who was teaching formerly in Saginaw, then in Bauteau and now living in West Bay (Montreal Island) waiting for a place, would be perhaps good for this mission.\n\nExcuse me, dear Mrs. Kelan, to take so much of your time. Pray for Lord, to give you His Blessing and to help you in your important work.\n\nReligiously Yours in Christ,\n\nFather Paul Rind'homme, S.J.\n\n(1) I met Mr. Gremin who told me that Miss Casey had no place of teacher yet. I would be pleased if she had the preference. She was in Garden River, and turned Catholic last Christmas.\nOttawa, June 15th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report which indicates that the services of Miss MacNulty, teacher of the Mississauga River Indian Day School, are not satisfactory.\n\nI would appreciate receiving your opinion regarding her services and, at the same time, you should state if she has intimated to you any desire to relinquish her duties at this school at the end of the current month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Madigan,\nBlind River,\nOnt.\nMarch 7th, 1934.\n\nYour Excellency:\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 23rd and to state that I have visited the Indian school at Mississaga. I have observed the abnormal behaviour of the teacher Miss McNulty, such as refusing to touch the Indians or their clothes, wearing rubber gloves to touch them, throwing powder in the school room in order to disinfect it etc. Miss McNulty is an efficient enough teacher, although her whole attitude seems to be antagonistic to the Indians. I did not mention this in my report since I did not feel sure enough of this fact to mention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRaymond R. Maurice,\nSeparate School Inspector.\n\nBishop J.D. Scollard,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nDiocese of Sault Ste. Marie\n\nMr. C. F. MacKenzie  \nNorth Bay, Ont., March 10th, 1934  \nSec. of the Deptt. for Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nI had heard from some parties of the exaggerated precautions adopted by the teacher of the Indian School of Mississauga. I have heard also that her practices and manners tend to antagonize the Indians. To assure myself of the truth of the complaints, I communicated with the Inspector who visits that school. I enclose your his reply \u2014 he evidently considers her tactics and attitude abnormal.\n\nAny one who knows the Indians will understand that a teacher in order to be efficient in her work must first win the affection of the pupils. She will get nowhere with them if she antagonizes them.\n\nI think it would be advisable to let Miss McNulty go at the end of the school year and get another. Having a Normal School in North Bay many of our local girls obtain teaching certificates \u2014 and so there is a surplus of teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD. B.

Mississauga,\n\nIt may happen that the question be already settled about the school teacher in Mississauga, it may happen also that it is not, and it is with this hope that I am bringing a few details which may help in the decision.\n\nI was in Mississauga these days, the first time since the school is over, and I had the visit of some of the Indian parents complaining about the school teacher.\n\nIt seems that Miss MacBulby was surpassing her rights towards the children. Quite often, told me the parents, she was keeping the children late, sometimes until six o'clock in the evening, and sometimes also making them coming one hour before the school opens in the morning.\nFor some of the children leaving far, especially in winter time, it is too hard. Myself, when I was coming to the mission, I was surprised to see the children leaving so late from school; nevertheless, I never said anything, estimating that there was a reason for it. But when this thing occurs too often, the sufficient reason is not more here.\n\nI wonder also, if it is a good pedagogical counsel to tell the children, and forbid them to say anything to their parents of what she had said in school; and saying also to the children, that there is no use for their parents to come and see her, that she will not accept any complaint from them. The result is that some of the children have less respect for their parents, and more incline not to listen to them.\n\nThe parents came and asked me, if there will not be any possibility for their children to be accepted in Spanish. Of course, I answered them that this was impossible, because they were leaving close to the school, but this is an indication of the spirit of discontentment which exists among the people.\n\nI certainly insist that Miss McReilly be changed. She is just making herself be feared by the children; they submit because they are afraid of her, but they do not like her, and the general impression is that she should be changed.\nThe children have no courage at work, too often she is too stern, and too severe. She is most likely a very good school-teacher for a city-school, but for a small country school, or a mission, she is not of that type that will make a good work. She has not only to teach the children, but she has also to form their character and to educate them. She is not encouraging the children, and too many times she said openly that she was despising the children. This makes the work very hard for the missionary. I am afraid to put myself in cause, this being able to make my testimony of smaller value, but I am obliged to say that I found that there is no cooperation possible with Miss McReilly. I would have difficulties with the six or seven other school-teachers I have in my missions, I would say that it is due to myself, but I must admit that in all the other places I am getting along fine with the school-teachers, and that we are able to do some good work for the children.\n\nIn Mississauga, it is the contrary that happens; when I suggested something, I mean in my line, church or teaching of religion, I never interfered with anything in school\u2014Miss McReilly did the contrary of what I was asking her. In the small missions, we need the help of the school\u2014\nteacher, if we want to be able to do some good work in Mississauga for two years, we lost our time.\n\nI must make an exception for the three months Miss McKitchen was teaching. Of course, because young, Miss McReilly despised her, and said that she was no good; but the facts and results were there; the children were more encouraged, more pleased, and more ready to do something; she had the talent to make them work, and like their work... I could add also that her talent as a musician, playing and singing, made her be in favour. We have also that other testimony, that when Miss McKitchen left, most of the children went to the station, 3 miles distant, to greet her and tell her they were sorry to see her leaving...\n\nThey would not do it for Miss McReilly. During the time Miss McKitchen was there, there was certainly an atmosphere of release, contentment, and peace.\n\nI wish earnestly that we could have her coming back to Mississauga, it is the general wish among parents and children. She was teaching this year in Penetanguishene, but I know, that anytime we will need her, she will be ready to come again and teach in our missions... She understands the teaching more under that idea to devote herself for the good of the poor children than of a way to make a living, and have in the same time an easy life.\n\nMiss McReilly does not want to admit any fault in herself, she seems to have the persuasion that she is perfect finished in every detail. Indignant, and very set in her ways and ideas, queer also, she is contrary...\nAs I am writing to you, Honan, I will take the opportunity to recommend Miss Cozy, for the school of Gerald Bay; as far as I know, and about what Mr. J. Smith, our Indian Agent for that district, told me, she should be able to do a very good work. It is also the opinion of Mr. Greening, and of our Bishop, Pape, Scotland.\n\nWe were all sorry that Miss Duff decided to leave, because during the four years she was in that hard mission, she did a very good work, and was well liked; but as she is leaving to settle definitely for life for better, we can only approve her...\n\nThanking you in advance for the interest you will take in this matter, I beg your Honour to accept my regards.\n\nYours truly in Christ,\nFather Paul Pond, honman, S.J.,\nMissionary Priest.\n\nSt. Ignatius' Rectory\n331, Cathcart St.\nSainte-S\u00e9-Marie\n(ontario)\nDiocese of Sault Ste. Marie\n\nNorth Bay, Ont., Aug. 14th, 1934.\n\nMr. Philip Sheehan,\nActing Asst. of Indian Schools.\n\nDear Mr. Sheehan:\n\nI wrote to the Department some months ago pointing out the singularities of a certain Miss McMulley, the teacher in the Indian day school at Macassaqua, near Blind River. Knowledge of this lady's idiosyncrasies was brought to me by the missionary priest and his complaints were confirmed in a letter which I received from the Separate School Inspector. Following information from such reliable authorities, I wrote on April 10th last to Mr. McKenzie of the Department and recommended that Miss McMulley be not re-engaged at the end of the past school year. Mr. McKenzie, in a letter dated April 16th, in reply stated that my recommendation would be given very careful consideration. The missionary priest informed me a few days ago that Miss McMulley had been as far as he could learn re-engaged for the coming year. I cannot understand how the Department could re-engage this teacher unless it considered the representations made in my letter of April 10th to be unworthy of credence.\nDiocese of Sault Ste. Marie\n\nNorth Bay, Ont., 193\n\nThere are several good normal-trained teachers without schools, and it is not necessary to keep any teacher in a school with such marks, etc., etc., etc., and such singular antics, that the Indians themselves notice them, remark about them, and ridicule them. I trust that the Department may reverse its decision, if it be true that it has engaged Miss McMillan in the Mississaga School.\n\nI have learned that Mr. Downey has left the Indian School on the Pic River near Severn Bay. In my opinion there should be a male teacher or that school, or an elderly (I mean 30 or 35 years old) female teacher in that school. It is a most isolated place, and I do not think a young lady could remain there very long. If you have not a teacher for that school, I would try to get a suitable one for it. With best wishes, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nH. J. Scott\n\nBp. of S. M.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher has given the pupils systematic training in all the subjects with success.\n\n\"Although the pupils in charge of Miss MacNulty have been progressing this year, it may be...\"\nbe advisable to transfer the teacher to another school if at all possible on account of the misunderstanding between the teacher, the parish priest and the Indians.\n\n\"The missionary in charge of the Mississauga Mission has been in my office several times complaining about the teacher on matters not pertaining to her teaching. It seems that the Indians are not satisfied with her on account of this misunderstanding between the missionary and the teacher.\"\n\nThe local missionary, Rev. P. Prud'homme, S.

At the same time, from our previous experience with Miss MacNulty at the St. Regis Village School, the Department understands the reasons for the present complaints regarding her.\n\nI should appreciate your direction in this matter in order that a reply may be made to His Lordship Bishop Scollard.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 16th, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nSince September 1st, 1932, Miss M.

D. J. Scollard, Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie, that the services of Miss M. MacNulty, teacher of the Mississauga River Indian Day School (Reserve No. 8, Electoral District of Algoma East), be dispensed with, owing to certain friction which had developed between herself and the local Catholic Missionary on the Reserve. At that time, you instructed that Miss MacNulty's services be retained for the term ending the 31st instant, and that the matter be again submitted for your consideration.\n\nOwing to the death of His Lordship Bishop Scollard, no further action was taken.\n\nMiss MacNulty has been in the employ of the Department for several years. Both the public school inspector and the local Indian Agent have invariably reported her teaching services to be satisfactory. The only complaint that has been made against her is lack of tact in her dealings with the Indian parents, and the complaint of the Roman Catholic Missionary, unrelated to her teaching service.\n\nIn fairness to Miss MacNulty, it should be stated that the disagreement between herself and the local Missionary is not entirely one-sided. The Missionary is aggressive, and, during his visits to the school and reserve, Miss MacNulty has considered that his instructions, which practically amount to a demand, are not always in the interests of the classroom work.\n\nI would submit for consideration that, as no recent complaints have been received regarding Miss MacNulty, and also in view of her lengthy and satisfactory service, that she be continued as teacher, at least for the balance of the present school year ending June 30th, 1935.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 1st, 1935.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI beg to refer to memoranda of August 16th and December 24th, 1934, regarding the services of Miss M. MacNulty, teacher of the Mississauga River Indian Day School (Reserve No. 8 - Electoral District of Algoma East).\n\nThe late Right Reverend D. Scollard, Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie, requested that Miss MacNulty's services be dispensed with, owing to her inability to work in harmony with the local Catholic missionary on the reserve. You approved of her services being continued as teacher for the balance of the present school year, ending June 30th, 1935.\n\nI may say that there have been no recent complaints. Her work in the classroom is satisfactory and the pupils under her charge have made progress. This is a rather difficult situation to deal with, in fairness to Miss MacNulty, against whose teaching services there has been no complaint. The principal reason for requesting her dismissal was her lack of tact in her dealings with the Indian parents and the local Catholic missionary.\n\nI am submitting this case for your consideration and direction as to whether Miss MacNulty should be given notice that her services will not be required after June 30th, next, the end of the present school year, or whether her services be retained for a further period.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSpanish River Reserve\nMay 16, 1939\n\nMr. P. Phelan\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAs the school year draws to a close, I have been thinking of a new teaching position for next year. If possible, I would like to continue to teach in an Indian School. Reverend Father Moylan has heard that there will be a vacancy at Mississauga School for September. He suggested that I write to you and ask if this be the case would it be of any advantage to me to apply for this school. Should I send in a formal letter of application to Ottawa?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRoseline Kelly\nOttawa,\nMay 26, 1929.\n\nEXD\n\nDear Miss Kelly:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant I may say that we have no intimation as yet that the teacher of the Mississauga school intends to give up duties.\n\nIt is extremely difficult at the present time for the Department to arrange a transfer from one Indian school to another due to the fact that when a vacancy occurs there is always some local person who considers that he or she should receive the preference.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss H. Kelly,\nTeacher,\nSagamook Indian Day School,\nMassey, Ont.\nOttawa, January 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPublic School Inspector Carriere,\nin his report on the Mississauga Indian Day School\ndated December 19, 1939, states:\n\n\"Seven children of school age are not attending this school.\nThey have gone to the woods with their parents. These pupils will certainly be a problem to the teacher next spring when they come back\".\n\nI am anxious to secure a report from you with respect to the absence of these children and why it was necessary for the Indian parents to take these children to the woods. In view of the war conditions now confronting us, it is not the intention of the Department to keep schools open with comparatively small enrolments, and it is certainly not the desire or intention to keep schools open and in operation if Indian parents are not sufficiently interested to make an attempt to have their children attend regularly.

I understand that many are being taken for teaching positions who have not the full qualifications. This year I am completing Junior Matriculation. I would be able to get my subjects off by private study in the evenings; as it is, I have spare periods to fill in by the dozens and have much time in my hands.\n\nI will be eighteen on March 20th and feel fully capable of taking over the school. I have visited there several times and have an idea of the Indian mentality.\n\nI spoke to Father Oliver and he advised me to write and told me that he would send you a letter too. The teachers at the Separate High School have encouraged me to write advising me to come to them for help in my subjects for my complete fourths. They have offered to\n...much work done for the teaching of the lower classes.\n\nAs for references as to school work and character; I shall get them from my teachers if you wish. Mother Oliver has been most generous and knows me well. She told me there would be no need to get character references as she would vouch for me in this letter.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nYours very sincerely,\nPaul Berthelot.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttached herewith please find for your consideration application for position as teacher of the Mississauga Indian Day School which was forwarded to this office by Paul Berthelot, Blind River, Ontario.\n\nR.

On my last visit to the Reserve I found that these children were arriving at school soaking wet on account of having to come through wet grass and brush.\n\nI arranged with the Indians to brush this trail so that the children would be able to get through without getting wet.

In this letter she requests salary at the rate of $100.00 a month.\n\nYou will remember that when she was appointed we were doubtful if she could carry on the school, in view of her family responsibilities. Apparently, she has been successful, as in a recent report from the School Inspector he commented favourably on the work that she has done.\n\nI cannot see any particular reason for her desiring to transfer to the Mississauga School, and, in any event, we are not prepared to approve this transfer, as the living quarters are not sufficiently large for a married woman with three children.\n\nWe have been allowing Mrs. Petahategoose $80.00 a month, plus bonus of 17%. We are prepared to increase the salary to $90.00 a month, plus bonus for 1945-46, if you consider such action advisable. At this rate she would be earning slightly over $100.00 a teaching month, and, as she is an Indian, there is no income tax deducted from her. Please let me hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 20, 1945.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, in which you make application for appointment as teacher of an Indian day school.\n\nI presume that you are Catholic and we require a Catholic teacher at the Mississauga Indian Day School. This school is located three miles from Blind River, Ontario, with teacher's living quarters attached to the school. Salary is allowed at the rate of $95.00 per teaching month, plus bonus of 17%. There is a deduction of 5% from the basic salary for the Retirement Fund and the money placed in this fund is returned with interest when you give up duties as teacher of an Indian school. There are, of course, the usual deductions for income tax. The school should re-open on September 4, 1945.

I have not answered it up to now because I have been able to find no trace of a suitable teacher for the Mississauga school. All the prospects that came to my knowledge are either going to Normal or have taken positions at a much higher salary than the Indian Department is able to offer.\n\nThere are however, two possible teachers still in the field. One is Mrs. Pelletier from Wikwemikong who is in her sixties and has not taught for a number of years. She knows of the opening and would like to take the position in order to support her father or mother, I am not sure which, who would live at the school with her.\n\nThe other is Mrs. Moran who was so successful at Mississauga a couple of years ago. She would be afraid to go back without a telephone but I think if I could promise her a pay-phone, even, she could easily be persuaded to return. If you could obtain sufficient priority to secure a phone I would gladly pay at least part of the expenses of installation, if that would be the means of obtaining so good a teacher.\n\nYours very truly\n\nMissionary\nOttawa, September 11, 1945.\n\nDear Father McKey:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to securing a teacher for the Mississauga School. I do not think it would be advisable to consider Mrs. Pelletier.\n\nI also regret to say that I do not think we can secure any priority for a telephone. As a matter of fact, I feel that if you could get in touch with the District Manager of the Bell Telephone Company you would have as much chance as we have of having them place a phone near the school. The Department would not be in a position to bear any of the cost, as we do not supply phones to Indian day schools.\n\nI tried to secure Miss Christine Wakegijig who applied for a school, but by the time my answer reached her she had secured another situation. We are still making enquiries and if anyone is available, an appointment will be made. However, if Mrs. Moran will take the school, we would be glad to re-appoint her.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. E.

Conditions \u2014 as outlined in the enclosed letter \u2014 prevent my doing so.\n\nI regret this very much and when I am free to take a school, I shall let you know.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nMargaret McNulty.\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 31st. DECEMBER 1945.\n\nWELFARE AND TRAINING: The Mississauga Indian Day School has not been opened due to the fact that the teacher Miss McNulty has not yet arrived. Relief was supplied only to the aged and destitute.\n\nSchool attendance has been above average for this quarter.\nOttawa, January 17, 1946.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nMiss MacNulty advises me that her services will not be available. Consequently it will be necessary to secure someone else to take charge of the Mississauga School. Father McKey phoned me yesterday and I understood from him that the services of Paul Berthelot are still available and he may be appointed teacher for the balance of the current academic year. I enclose the necessary forms which he should complete and return.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nCLAIM FOR MARRIED STATUS OR DEPENDENTS\n\n(Effective in respect of all Salaries and Wages paid on or after 1st January, 1946)\n\nFile this revised form with your employer prior to 30th December, 1945, as otherwise your employer must make tax deductions as if you were a single person without dependents (See Items 10 and 15).

CLAIM FOR DEPENDENTS\u2014You may claim as dependents ONLY those persons described in Item 8 on reverse side.\n\nI have the following persons wholly dependent upon me, who will not receive an income of their own in excess of $400 during the year and who are resident in Canada, in the British Empire, or in allied countries:\n\n| NAME AND ADDRESS OF DEPENDENT | Year of Birth | Relationship to Taxpayer |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n|                               |              |                         |\n\nNOTE.\u2014Claim for dependent qualifications for \"Married Status\" must be made in Item 4.

(RG 10, Volume 6143, File 409-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nINFORMATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE\n\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only\u2014\n\n(1) Any person under eighteen years of age and wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer has in law or in fact the custody and control.\n\n(2) Sons and daughters (including illegitimate sons and daughters) or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters or brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, or grandchildren, under eighteen years of age, or under twenty-one and attending school, or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n\n(3) Parents, grandparents, parents-in-law, or grandparents-in-law, incapable of self-support. Employees claiming dependents other than their own children are advised to read Item 16 below.\n\n9. \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" means a dwelling house, apartment or other similar place of residence, containing at least two bedrooms, in which residence amongst other things the taxpayer as a general rule sleeps and has his meals prepared and served.\n\n10. Effect of Failure to File Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946). In cases where Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946) is not completed and filed with the employer deductions from the salaries or wages paid each after January 1st, 1946 must be made as if the employee were a single person without dependents even though the employee may have filed a previous Form T.D.1. Single persons without dependents need not file this form.\n\n11. Change in Status or Dependents\u2014If during the year any change occurs in the status of dependents of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form T.D.1. A change in status will affect the Allowance cheque should not call for an amended T.D.1 Form unless the change is in excess of $1.00 per month. See Item 19 for information regarding effect of changes on deductions during the currency of the year.\n\n12. If Employee Has More Than One Employer, it will be necessary to complete and file Form T.D.1 with each employer, to claim married status or dependents.\n\n13. Filing of Income Tax Return. In addition to filing this form you must file your Income Tax Return Form T.1 Special or T.1 General for the calendar year on or before 30th April of the following year.\n\n14. Family Allowances rates\u2014\n\nFor each child under 6 years of age, $5.00 per month\nFor each child 6 or over but under 10, $6.00 per month\nFor each child 10 or over but under 13, $7.00 per month\nFor each child 13 or over but under 16, $8.00 per month\n\nLess reductions in monthly allowances\u2014\n\nFor the fifth child\u2014$1\nFor the sixth and seventh child\u2014$2 each\nFor the eighth and each additional child\u2014$3 each\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE EMPLOYER\n\n15. If Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946) Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.1. (Revised January 1946) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents.\n\n16. Employer's Disallow Claim for Excessive Number of Dependents. To be entitled to the full tax credits for a dependent other than the taxpayer's own children or grandchildren (or any other dependents in Item 8 (1) above), a taxpayer must contribute at least $400 annually to the support of such dependent. Many persons are unaware of this limitation. For tax deduction purposes, employers will make deductions from the salary or wages of an employee who claims more than two dependents in Item 5 as if the employee had only two dependents in addition to his own children or grand-children (or children as defined in Item 8 (1) above). The employer will notify the employee that he must submit proof of any claim for more dependents to the District Inspector of Income Tax. If the employee proves to the satisfaction of the Inspector that he is entitled to further allowances, the employee will be advised accordingly.\n\n17. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Persons for Married Status. The definition of a \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" contained in Item 9 indicates clearly that a taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status by reason of supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer. Therefore, employers are instructed to check the address shown under \"Married Status\" against the actual address in Item 2 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration) and in every case where the addresses are not identical the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n18. Employer's Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.1. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Items 16 and 17 above and will otherwise complete and file Form T.D.1 only completed. If any employee shows children under 16 years of age as dependents under Items 4 or 5, he must also complete Item 6 or the employer shall not take account of such dependents under 16 years of age for tax deduction purposes. He will also delete as a dependent under Item 5 the name of any person whom the employee has already listed in Item 4 unless the claim for married status came within paragraph (C) thereof. If the employer has reason to believe that the information on this form is incorrect or false, he will not act upon the information until the employee has made the appropriate confirmation or correction. In case of doubt, the matter should be referred to the District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n19. Action on Receipt of Amended Form T.D.1 During Currency of Year. Employers are required to file an amended Form T.D.1 if any change occurs in status or dependents. The employer should give immediate effect to a change from \"Single status\" to \"Married status\", or an increase in the number of dependents and to any substantial change (i.e. in excess of $1.00 per month) in the Family Allowance cheque. A change from \"Married status\" to \"Single status\" (e.g. where the employee becomes a widow) should not be made effective until the first pay period in the next calendar year because the employee will still be entitled to claim Married status for the whole of the calendar year in which the event took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally require a change in the deductions until the following calendar year with one important exception due to the provision that a taxpayer may not claim as a dependent any person who has an income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a son who was previously claimed as a dependent under Item 5 is claimed as a dependent on Form T.D.1 takes up employment from which he will earn over $400 during the calendar year, immediate effect should be given to the amended form T.D.1 as otherwise the employee will be left with a substantial balance of tax to pay with his return on Form T.1 Special or T.1 General.\n\n20. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n21. Completed Forms T.D.1 must be kept on file by the employer in order that they may be available at all times for payroll inspection by officers of the Taxation Division.\nOttawa, February 1, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Mississauga Indian Day School,\nNo. 409.\n\nThe Department has appointed Mr. Paul Bertholet teacher of the above-named school, effective January 21, 1946, at a salary of $85.00 a month plus bonus.

In the event of Miss Leblanc accepting appointment at the Serpent River School, we would appreciate it if you would arrange with Miss Robicheau to transfer to the Mississauga School. If this is effected, you should immediately notify Indian Agent Laurence in order that he can assist Miss Robicheau in re-opening the Mississauga School. Mr. Arneil understands that Indian Agent Laurence informed Miss Robicheau that there is no teacher's residence at Mississauga. It will be necessary for her to live in Blind River. Mr. Laurence was expected to arrange with the Provincial Government authorities for ploughing the road this winter so that Miss Robicheau could use her car.\n\nWe are also informed that Mr. Arneil promised to rent a building suitable for Miss Robicheau to store her car at Blind River.\n\nWe are prepared to allow her salary at the rate of $131.00 a month if she makes this transfer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Accordingly I spoke last evening to Miss Robicheau regarding the proposed transfer and found her by no means in favour of such a change. She likes her school, likes the people, and likes the children. She wants to stay right where she is.\n\nHowever, I do know of a very good teacher who does want a transfer to the Mississauga school. That is Mrs. Pidadigons who is at present teaching at the Indian school at Whitefish. She claims she would not be deserting that school since there is a woman there at the reserve who has been trying to obtain the appointment to her school for the past two years. Mrs. Pidadigons has no car but would be glad to make the trip out from Blind River every day if some allowance could be made for travelling expenses even if it were not complete, and a similar allowance to make up for the lack of accommodations at the school. This woman has a First Class teaching certificate.\n\nIf this alternative does not meet with your approval at the present time, I would be grateful if the name of Mrs. Pidadigons should be kept in mind when there is need of a teacher to open classes in the new Mississauga school building, as we all hope, next year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.

In case she writes I shall immediately then the matter over to Father MacKey and he will get in touch with Mr. Laurence and see what can be done. In the meantime we have taken the children here and are endeavouring to get all the application forms fixed up. Unfortunately several girls could not be accommodated and I understood that Mr. Laurence was making other arrangements for them. If the school opens it will be a simple matter to send them back.

N. Godin for the position of teacher of the Mississauga school. He was wondering what salary he could expect. This is rather important to him as he has a wife and, I think, three small children. He lives in Blind River and has a car with which to drive back and forth to Mississauga.\n\nI think I can safely recommend this man for the position. He is French as his application indicates, but during the time that I knew him before he considered teaching at Mississauga he was always careful and accurate in his use of English. I also know him to be conscientious and of exemplary conduct at all times.\n\nIf you could let him know the outcome of his application and what salary he can expect, with allowances for travelling expenses and for fuel and lodging, he would very much appreciate your consideration.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is a present registration of 37 pupils.\n\nLast January I was given a substantial allowance in my salary since there were no living quarters in Mississauga; the situation is still the same, and I expect to receive the same allowance for the travelling and lodging expenses.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. H. Godin\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the time of my employment at the Mississaugas Indian Day School last January, your letter stated that \"I was receiving a substantial allowance for transportation and living quarters.\" My present salary has been set by Mr. Doucet, Inspector, but does not include this allowance. I have written to this effect six weeks ago. I suppose the letter did not reach you since I have received no reply.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It does not answer my previous letter by any means.\n\nI am fully aware that my salary is higher than last year's, but this is based entirely on my qualifications.\n\nI would not have taken this position last September had I known that the allowance of approximately fifty dollars a month would have been withdrawn.\n\nSince I have never received any notice from your department I was led to understand that the allowance...\nfor travelling to school would be granted till the new school was ready for occupation.\n\nMr. Phelan made it clear in my engagement last January that \u00a347.50 monthly comprised a considerable allowance until the school would be built. The fact that the Department has set a new salary schedule has not changed the situation here.\n\nMr. Lawrence and Father McKay think my demand very justifiable.\n\nI am sure that you will consider my demand as fair and honest and I expect an immediate answer as I urgently need this amount of money.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. H. Godin\nOttawa, December 20, 1947.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nDuring the academic year 1946-47 we allowed Mr. Godin, teacher of the Mississauga School, salary at the rate of $147.00 a teaching month. According to the new salary schedule for teachers of Indian day schools, we placed his salary at $156.00 effective from September 1st, 1947. In setting his salary at $147.00 a month in the first place, we were actually paying him more than we paid the previous teacher, partly due to the fact that there was no living accommodation at the school.\n\nWe have recently received two letters from him intimating that he considers that his present salary of $156.00 a month is based on his qualifications and that he is entitled to an amount over and above that due to the fact that he is under some expense in reaching the school each day. Actually, we are not allowed to pay travelling expenses of teachers and as already stated, we are allowing Mr. Godin as much salary as the salary schedule provides.\n\nWith the above in mind I would appreciate having your comments on the matter.\n\nBernard F.

I have suggested that he write to you directly and arrange the time and date for his visit.\n\nI informed Mr. Menard that we had received no indication from you as to the possibility of a move on the part of Mr. Godin.

Godin, teacher at the Mississauga Indian Day School, has written me regarding an allowance he received last year for travelling to and from school each day.\n\nMr. Godin has to live in Blind River as there is no accommodation at present for him on the Mississauga Reserve.\n\nOn this account last year, he received a higher salary than had been paid previously to a teacher for this school. He now claims that, although his salary is higher this year on account of the new classification, Grade II, that he should still receive something extra on account of there being no living accommodation for him on the Mississauga Reserve and also on account of the extra expense incurred by having to travel to and from Blind River every day.\n\nDepartmental letter 36-1-5 dated June 5th, 1946, allowed Mr. Berthelet extra salary on this account after the school was destroyed by fire.\n\nKindly advise me regarding this matter at your convenience.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 13-9-1 (W.T.l) dated December 20th, 1947 regarding salary allowed Mr. Godin, teacher at the Mississauga School.\n\nDuring the academic year 1946-47, Mr. Godin was allowed a higher salary than had been previously paid to a teacher of this school, namely $147.00. The reason for this was that he had to pay travelling expenses to and from Blind River and also pay extra for his room, etc., on account of there being no living accommodation for him on the Reserve.\n\nAccording to the new salary schedule, his salary is now $156.00 per month based on his qualifications. In my opinion, he is still entitled to some extra remuneration above his present salary of $156.00 a month to allow for his expenses travelling to and from Blind River. This extra amount would stop as soon as the new school is completed.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSault Ste.

In a letter from you dated last July I was told that this order would be held until I was able to use it in the new building. Please advise me if I shall receive this order soon.\n\nAfter several requests I received a cheque of \u00a340 for travelling and lodging expenses for four months. I was very disappointed as I was given an allowance of some \u00a340 monthly last year.\nIt seems that this decrease is due to my rank in salary. But I think this is unjust since my salary is based entirely on my qualifications and experience according to the new salary schedule. But the teaching conditions in Mississauga remained the same.\n\nIf you think this matter worthwhile to be investigated I would appreciate very much that this be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H.

The teacher is Mr. Godin, age 37 years with a Second Class Certificate and twelve years experience.\n\nThis school was being conducted in the Roman Catholic Church while waiting the completion of the new school. Due to the enrolment of thirty-eight it was being run in two groups; the Juniors in the morning; the Seniors in the afternoon. Due to the very cold weather, only twelve were present when I inspected.\n\nI found these children poor at following directions. It was evident that they had received too much individual attention and could not work well on their own. I advised Mr. Godin to make more use of workbooks and textbooks and to place more responsibility on his pupils. They seem slow and lethargic and are making fair progress only. In Arithmetic fundamentals I found them quite weak and their Spelling was only fair. Mr. Godin speaks good English and maintains easy discipline. I later discussed with Mr. Godin his intentions for next year. He is writing a High School Teachers' Certificate Examinations in May and if he passes, intends to attempt to get a position at the High School in Blind River.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nOttawa, February 9, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nClassroom Inspection Report -\nMississauga Indian Day School.\n\nI visited this school on February 4th. The teacher is Mr. Godin, age 37 years with a Second Class Certificate and twelve years experience.\n\nThis school was being conducted in the Roman Catholic Church while waiting the completion of the new school. Due to the enrolment of thirty-eight it was being run in two groups; the Juniors in the morning; the Seniors in the afternoon. Due to the very cold weather, only twelve were present when I inspected.\n\nI found these children poor at following directions. It was evident that they had received too much individual attention and could not work well on their own. I advised Mr. Godin to make more use of workbooks and textbooks and to place more responsibility on his pupils. They seem slow and lethargic and are making fair progress only. In Arithmetic fundamentals I found them quite weak and their spelling was only fair. Mr. Godin speaks good English and maintains easy discipline. I later discussed with Mr. Godin his intentions for next year. He is writing a High School Teachers' Certificate Examinations in May and if he passes, intends to attempt to get a position at the High School in Blind River. He was advised to inform the Department immediately he receives definite word concerning this examination. He would be a satisfactory teacher, but seems to lack self-confidence and apparently the Agent agreed with me in thinking that he lacks initiative.\nMr. Buck, the Chief Architect was inspecting the new school while I was with Mr. Godin.

Indian Day School for the season 1948-49.\n\nMiss Cyr has a 2nd. class certificate from the Ottawa Normal School. She has no experience, as this will be her first school, but seemed anxious to make a success of her work.\n\nMiss May Jameus was away taking a summer course, to obtain her 2nd. class certificate, as she had missed some of her subjects through illness. I was advised by Father Oliver, Principal of the Spanish Indian Residential School, that she had a school for the coming season. He also stated that Mrs. Jeanne Mallette has three children, and her husband worked in the sawmill at Blind River. For this reason I did not interview her as I felt that the living quarters at the school would be too small for a family of this size. Also I had practically engaged Miss Cyr by the time I received word from you regarding her application. I also had to act at once as Miss Cyr had already received a wire offering her a school at Makatay at $1700.00 per year and requesting an immediate reply. She also has been offered a school at Gogama.\n\nTrusting the above meets with your approval,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\nSault Ste. Marie Ontario.\n\nRPGL/cwc\nJuly 26, 1948.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nMississauga Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department approves the appointment of Miss Bernadette Cyr of Blind River, Ontario as teacher of the above Indian Day School, effective September 1, 1948.\n\nHer salary will be at the rate of $1440 an academic year, in view of the fact that she holds a Second Class Teaching Certificate but has had no teaching experience as yet.\n\nPlease find attached application form, employee questionnaire form and Income tax forms which you can have Miss Cyr complete and return here.\n\nIt is presumed that the furniture for the teacher's residence has now arrived and that the teacherage is ready for occupancy.\n\nBernard F.

You will remember that I intimated to the Department that I was not much in favour of a school on that Reserve because the Indians are away in the bush about half of each year and before the school would have been closed. Even if Indians request me to be closed. Even if Indians request me to expend any money I shall never expend any money unless I can see that expenditure may be productive of some good results. Since however you are going on with the school I desire your attention to the necessity of accommodation for the teachers' school as you have already done of the Indian School but doing.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school being new we had some things to get which will not have to be renewed for some time. I think we can go with the old desks for a while when I last saw the teacher she was quite satisfied with the desks and seemed quite willing that they should do for some time. The Band had a meeting the other night and wants to get new seats for the school and for the church. I suppose it would be more comfortable to have good seats, but I personally think they might do for a while as the Indian character is strange some old people who have chairs in their houses will sit down on the floor quite near the chair and without let it however I will not interfere will be pleased to do as you think best.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hagan\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 8, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 30th ult., which deals with the question of supplying new desks for the Nisinaiga school, I have to request that you will be good enough to ascertain from the teacher the number of desks required, giving at the same time the ages of the children.\n\nWhen this information is received, the matter will receive the attention of the Department.

It was thought that the account for $5.00 presented by you covered the cost of material and labour. The Agent now writes that the account for oil etc., has already been paid. It appears to the Department that the charge for applying this oil to the floors is too high, but it will pay $5.00 for the work.\n\nKindly submit account in duplicate through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMiss Annie Kehoe,\nTeacher,\nMississauga Indian School,\nBlind River, Ont.\nLetter No. 151703/5, dated Nov. 23rd, received\u2014They also purchased 1/2 gallon raw linseed oil @ $1.50 per gal., 1/2 \" turpentine \" $1.50 and 1 bushel @ 25 cts. to be used in staining the floor of the Mississauga school\u2014Do not remember exactly the number of hours it took me to give the floor each time.\ncoal making a total of 44 or 48 hours.\n\nTo oiling floor of school room comprising 52 sq. yds.\n\n2 coals @ 8 cts. per sq. yd. - per coil $8.32\n\n$7.28\n\n$15.60\n\nI have sent the account in duplicates to the Agent to be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAnnie Kehoe\n\nIt being so soon after my operations I did not hurry, and neither could I - I took plenty of time never thinking I would have to give an account of the number of hours it took me - I remember correctly I began the first coil at 4 o'clock P.M. on Sept. 29th, last, and finished it on Saturday P.M. the 30th, about 5 or 6 o'clock, did likewise with the other three coils on the following dates - Oct. 6th, and 7th, 13th and 14th, 20th, and 21st, as near as I can remember it took me 11 or 12 hours to put on each\nOttawa, 13th December, 1911.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th instant, regarding linseed oil etc., which you purchased for staining the floor of the Mississauga School house, I beg to remind you that you were informed in letter of the 23rd November that you should make out an account for the articles purchased.

I referred the matter to a professional painter. I asked him what he could do the work for the days if I was there I would do it for $2.75 or will oil the floor and grain it for $1.00.

It is noticed that she includes also payment for the stain and brush. On November 6th, last, a cheque for $4.75, No. 1477, for this material was sent you. Kindly state whether it has been handed to the merchant.\n\nAs Miss Kehoe closes the school this week I have to ask you to give this matter immediate attention and also go down to the reserve and take an inventory of the supplies in the school-room and teacher's dwelling and see that all doors and windows are securely locked, in case sometime may elapse before the services of another teacher are secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nBlind River, Ont., Nov 10th,\n\nMr. S.

Solomon Bros. have handed me your letters of March 30th, 1911, September 7th and 14th, 1911 and have asked me to attend to this matter for them. It appears that they should have received the cheque for $3.10, in payment of the account of Solomon Bros. & T. Shamess and this cheque has never been received.\n\nI might say that Solomon Bros. bought out the interest of T. Shamess in the business formerly conducted by Solomon Bros. & T. Shamess, so that Solomon Bros. are the proper parties to receive payment and have the authority to endorse the cheque. As this matter has been outstanding for such a long time, I would be very glad if you would take it up and issue a duplicate cheque, because the first cheque has apparently been mislaid by Mr. S. Hagan, your Indian Agent at Thessalon, Ontario. Had it been paid, you would have received it long ago.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is stated that the cheque never reached the firm named, and I may say that it is still outstanding. In your letter of the 11th September 1911, you stated you received the cheque on the morning of the 13th February, 1911, and that you immediately enclosed it in a letter and forwarded it to Blind River.

I enclose herewith a form of Bond of Indemnity which you should execute and return to the Department. If it is found satisfactory, a duplicate cheque will be sent to Messrs. Solomon Bros. Had the firm named received the cheque and lost it, they would have been required to furnish a bond before a duplicate could issue. It is fortunate that the amount of the cheque is not large.\n\nIn future you should register all letters containing cheques, and in the event of loss they can be traced.\n\nWith reference to the bond, I beg to say that it is customary to have three names furnished therein, but as the cheque is small it will be sufficient if you execute the bond with sureties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The water that they are using is not fit for use and they have to carry it about 30 rods. I have been speaking to the man who dug the well and put in the pump in it he says he will dig the well and put a pump in it for $25 per foot, but he wants me to pay his way to go down and see the place it would cost me $8.50 to take him to the school house $3.00 one way and back and $2.00 at the hotel he could ride from Blind River to the school house with me when I go to visit the school.\n\nKindly say if we may have the well, and if I am be allowed to pay his way down to see the location.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hogan,\nIndian Agent\nThessalon P.O.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 25, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the digging of a well at the Mississauga School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not see the necessity for the well digger going from Thessalon to the school, as you should be able to describe conditions to him. Would it not be possible for you to get a well digger at Blind River without bringing one all the way from Thessalon? You might submit a price from this man for this work. The Department is not prepared to say whether the well can be dug until it knows the price per foot which would be charged, including stoning.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to report that the Mother of Blind River positively refuses to reduce his bill for putting quails in the windows of the Teacher's rooms at Mississauga Indian School and hanging the bell he is charging 50\u00a2 per hour, and that every trip kindly advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Wagner\nIndian Agent\nThessalon, O.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nToronto\n\nIndian Affairs.

That is by Mr. Johnston he will dig the well, and make and put in the curb but the department must pay for the lumber for two dollars per foot from top to bottom. I think we have a lump which ought to be made to clear the well, I beg leave to say that this is the only offer I have got.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hogan\nIndian Agent\nSheraton P.O.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in further reference to the digging of a well at the Mississauga School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may have this work done on the conditions mentioned in your letter, viz.\u2014that the Department pay at the rate of $2.00 per foot for the digging and curbing, the material for the curbing to be supplied and paid for by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I sent the well dug down and he dug it three feet deep and got splendid water, it came in so fast they could not bail it out and he put 3 feet of cement in it and a piece more to the rim and we thought there was water enough to a whole farm and the Teacher has just called me by phone and says the water has dried up and the well is dry but there is not a drop of water within nearly a mile of the school what would you advise us to do we must have water it is a very strange thing, I might mention that a farmer about 6 miles from this farm had a well that acted like this one and he put cement in the bottom and that held the water so he has no more trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Hogan\nIndian Agent\nThessalon P.O.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 26, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in reference to the well at the Mississauga School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like you to obtain an estimate of the cost of cementing the bottom of the well, as was done by the neighbouring farmer to whom you refer.

I beg leave to say that to my personal knowledge they are correct. When Mr. Benson was visiting the school he saw immediately that we should have a wood shed and two closets and his plan was to have the closets built so that outsiders could not see them without having the key of the woodshed, which I thought was an excellent idea. The whole length of the shed is 28 feet including the closets. The shed proper is 12 x 24 and is very neat and tidy. There is a front door with nice casings all around it on the left of the door and about the center of the building is a trap door which is hung on hinges with a hook and staple to fasten it on the side, that is for throwing wood in, on the end farthest from the school is the closets with a door to each with lock and key. I am very much pleased with the whole arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hogan,\nIndian Agent\nThessalon, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary, Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

The voucher in question is being paid by Cheque No. 4010 for $33.20.\n\nThe two last items in the voucher, viz. $15.00 and 25 cents, have been disallowed and the voucher covering these charges is returned herewith. There is nothing to show that the Indian who received cash to the amount of $15.00 from Mr. Dykes performed labour to the value thereof, nor is there a receipt in support of this payment. I may say that a short time ago the Department paid an account of $16.00 to Alex. Nigonabe, for eight day's labour, in connection with the erection of a wood-shed and closets at the Mississauga School. If Mr. Dykes advanced money in this connection and has charged for the same in the above mentioned voucher, he should look to the Indian for his money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rothera\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to lack of water I fear I shan't be able to keep school open during the severe winter weather. Since the Pump went out of order in October, water was obtained from a spring about a quarter of a mile from the School. As the snow is deep and there is no road, it is impossible to carry water from there now.\n\nOn Jan. 4th George Boyce undertook to repair the Pump and on sounding the well found it dry hence there will be no water from that source for some time.\n\nUnder present disadvantageous conditions kindly advise what I had better do.\n\nWishing you a very happy New Year I am,\n\nMost respectfully Yours,\n\nJean M. Wainwright.\nSir,\n\nAm enclosing a letter I received from Miss M. Dequartt Rockburgh Mississaugas River school.\n\nThe pump has gone dry to the spring wheel in a little distance from the school is too far for the teacher to carry water from.\n\nRight now that owing to the want of rain both authorities the wells in their vicinity are only water or nearly so. Kindly advise if the school will be closed owing to this condition of affairs.\n\nHave written the chief of field and if there is any possible chance of getting water nearer the school this place where I am in the fall am afraid there will not be.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Rothera.\nOttawa, January 25, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Miss Jean McDermott, teacher of the Mississauga River Indian Day School, relative to the water supply.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the difficulty of obtaining water for the teacher's use is noted. You should arrange, if possible, to have an Indian or some other person draw the water required from a nearby source in a barrel. If it is necessary to do so, you may purchase a suitable barrel, and arrange to have the water required delivered at the teacher's residence as and when required. You should endeavour to have this service performed at the lowest possible cost, and it should only be continued until such time as there is a supply of water in the well, or until the teacher can obtain the quantity required herself from the spring which is situated about a quarter of a mile from the school.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear as to whether you have been able to arrange with an Indian or some other person to draw the water required for the teacher's use, and the amount that will be charged for the service. Kindly give this matter your early attention, so that the school will not be closed.\n\nYou may forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of drawing the water required for the teacher's use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter of Jan 24th, I beg to state that I have visited the said school at Assiniboia River and have arranged to have water drawn to the school when needed. Could not obtain a barrel so bought a large tea pail used by lumberman holding about 6 gallons of water with a lid to keep the water pure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is most dangerous. It seems that this has been the second attempt to get good water and it seems a failure. The water is only 9 ft. from the ground in the well. Depth only would give good water. At present the teacher and pupils use water from spring \u00bc mile away.\n\nA requisition was sent for one pillow, one blanket, two brooms, six cups, toweling three yards, some plates and spoons, lamp globe, lamp burners, etc., all of which I feel are very much needed here.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInsp.\nOctober 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Separate School Inspector in a report on his recent inspection of the Mississauga Indian Day School has drawn attention to the condition of the water supply. He states as follows:\n\n\"The well water is worse than ever. It is most dangerous. It seems that this has been the second attempt to get good water and it seems a failure. The water is only 9 ft. from the ground in the well. Depth only would give good water. At present the teacher and pupils use water from spring \u00bc mile away.\"\n\nPlease furnish a report as to what you would advise be done in order to improve the condition of the well in order to provide a supply of good water. You should also furnish an estimate of the cost of any work you would advise be undertaken. This matter should receive your earliest attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to letter of Oct 2 nd\n\nI beg to state that during the summer I had a couple of men digging a well but could not obtain water so had the present well bailed out & deepened & put in gravel and gravel in the bottom. On my last visit in September examined same & found the color of the water a little brown but the taste was all right. Might say that the old well where we have a pump wheel I had cleaned out a year ago is practically dry and most of the wells in this vicinity are very low owing to the dry spell of this last year.\n\nThe only thing I can see is to use the well water for washing & do as we did last year have some person carry water for drinking purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have noted the effort that was made during the past summer to have this well bailed out and deepened.\n\nIt is considered that the water in this well would be satisfactory for washing purposes and it is thought that the teacher could arrange with the older boys to carry from a nearby well the small quantity of water that would be required for drinking or cooking purposes. We are not prepared to incur any expense in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

He also states that the steps at the entrance to the school are old and broken and should be repaired, and he further suggests that the kitchen and bedroom be repapered.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report regarding the repairs referred to by the Inspector, stating whether you would recommend that they be carried out or not.

I have just bought a new car and I don't like the idea of leaving it exposed to the outside in the spring rain. Also, we don't have any room inside when the wood is wet and besides, the cold air gets into the garage. My dear car was stolen last year from here and I would like to have it back. But I think it's better to have it inside where you could consider buying the new building built.\n\nThe undersigned has signed\nsince holidays until the exception of Mr. Boyce. She spent the whole time in bed. I secured the Cod Liver Oil, and the children needed it badly. I thought I'd just have take it there in my sickness around here, but I know if not in Bird River she could save 5 months at quite a cost.\n\nI'm sure you will be able to make the journey. I told Mr. Boyce if you do succeed in getting permission to have the bull. I would suggest that you try for 3rd Grade but if you can't he would do the job in cheaper and satisfactory way any one I know of.\n\nHoping you are.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nM. A.

Miss McDermott, the teacher, visited the Department today and she states that this equipment is required. I have to request, therefore, that you will arrange to purchase as soon as possible a bed, complete with mattress and spring. It is considered that a three quarter size bed would be satisfactory and, while of serviceable type, it should be as inexpensive as possible. You should also arrange for the purchase of a comforter and two pillows and linoleum for the floors of the bedroom and living room of the teacher's living quarters.\n\nThe teacher states further that a new stove is required, with the necessary stove pipe. You should consult the teacher as to the supplies required, especially as to the type of stove that would be satisfactory, and you should then arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of the above articles. The Department will expect you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. The teacher also states that new stove pipes are required in the classroom. You may purchase this equipment, have the pipe installed and the heating facilities placed in good order before the cold weather sets in.\n\nAfter you have made the above authorized purchases, please forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.

However, you should arrange, during the present summer holidays, to have the toilets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good condition. Any repairs required should also be carried out. You may arrange for the purchase of a covered water tank with tap at bottom. It is considered that a tank of from four to six gallons capacity would be satisfactory. You may also purchase the number of enamelled drinking cups necessary for the individual use of the pupils.\n\nRelative to the Mississauga Indian Day School, you may also arrange for the purchase of a covered water tank with tap at bottom for this school and the number of individual enamelled drinking cups required for the pupils' use.

You should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for the above purposes for each of these schools, separately.\n\nShould the Inspector visit these schools after the holidays and make a further report to you, please send same to the Department for attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The chief said he would let me know. As I was waiting for an answer, the sanitary inspector for the district came and visited the school. He said he would paint the school for $100.\n\nI gave him the job and must say he has done a fine job. However, I claim he refused other work at the time I wrote him.

In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $5.00 in the purchase of these supplies. An itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, should be obtained when the purchase is made. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, December 20, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss MacNulty, teacher of the Mississauga River Indian Day School, visited the Department today and states that it will be impossible to heat the teacher's living quarters with wood and requests the Department to supply a Quebec heater and two tons of coal. As far as the Department is aware, wood has always been used at this school and no previous complaints have been made. Please let me know if you consider it necessary to purchase a new stove and coal. If so, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of both.\n\nMiss MacNulty also complains that the water has to be secured from a well about a quarter of a mile from the school. Please advise where the previous teacher obtained her drinking water and whether or not it is possible to secure same closer to the school than the distance mentioned.\n\nMiss MacNulty states that there is no lavatory at the teacher's residence. Please advise what it would cost to erect one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to letter of December 20th in regards to the heating of the teacher's living quarters at Mississauga River school might say that all the teachers that have taught for the last ten years have found it comfortable, and would not recommend a purchase of a coal stove. Miss McNulty was at Mississauga about two weeks, and found time to complain about everything, and not like she had been accustomed to, at the former school, having I understand living quarters with janitor to look after the teachers wants. In regards to the well, it is near the school and has been cleaned and it is ready for use. All the requirements sufficient for a school are at Mississauga, and it was only last year that the Department made alterations in the living quarters, making them more homelike for the teacher.\n\nThe attendance of white children at the school last was 12 and expect they will be the same after Xmas. Understand that Miss McNulty is not going to teach the white children, that is the report I got on my last visit to the school before the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** [Blank]\n\n**For:** Mississauga School, Mississaugas Agency\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education, of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

In future when forwarding such requests you should state definitely whether or not you recommend them and also give an estimate of their cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.,\nOctober 28th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 16th, 36-1-5, I beg to state that I have written to Dan Boyer who is at present in the woods, to ask him to hand over to Miss MacNulty, the teacher at the Mississauga Indian day school, the two gallons of paint which he was supposed to have received from the late agent, Mr. Sims, to paint the school out-houses.\n\nTo date, I have been unable to find out from the records in this office, if Boyer was paid for this job or not. At any rate, the season is too far advanced now, to do this work this year.\n\nThe wood shed at the school should be braced to keep it from collapsing. The cost of material and labour to remedy this would be approximately $10.00. The school floor should be stained and varnished. The wood work in the teacher's quarters should be painted. The cost of material and labour for this work would be approximately $35.00. The living room in the teacher's quarters requires new linoleum as the present rug is almost worn through in places. Twelve yards would be the amount of linoleum needed and the approximate cost of it would be $20.00.\n\nThese renovations should be carried out as they are really necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRG1/R\nOttawa,\nOctober 30, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant you may incur the following expenditures in connection with the Mississauga day school:\n\n1. $10.00 for material and labour in repairing the wood shed\n\n2. $35.00 for material and labour in painting the teacher's living quarters\n\n3. $20.00 for purchasing linoleum for the teacher's living room.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Marie, Ont.\nSeptember 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith find Requisition for school material received from Miss MacNulty of the Mississauga Reserve Indian Day School.\n\nMiss MacNulty asks that the porch be built on the front of her school at an approximate cost of $100.00, also that repairs to the chimney be made at a cost of approximately $15.00.\n\nA winter porch is badly needed at this school as it is filled to capacity and very crowded. There is no place for the children to hang their overcoats, etc. Once the cold weather sets in and by adding a porch to the front of the school it would give the extra room required. This could be done at a cost of approximately $100.00 for labour and material.\n\nI therefore recommend that, if at all possible, the chimney be repaired and the porch built.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant you may expend an amount of $100.00 for material and labour to erect a porch at the Mississauga Indian Day School. It is understood that Indians will be employed. If the material costs over $50.00 it will be necessary for you to forward detailed information to this office so that the purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nAn amount of $15.00 may be expended in repairing the chimney at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOctober 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September 16 I wrote you requesting that you allow $100.00 to build a porch on the Mississauga Reserve Indian Day School, which amount was to cover material and labour. This request was granted in your letter 36-1-5, September 20.\n\nI now find that my estimate was out considerably and that to build the porch required would at least cost $175.00, instead of $100.00. I am enclosing an estimate received from Harry H. Bell, Blind River, covering the cost of material required.\n\nKindly advise me if it would be possible to have the amount raised from $100.00 to $175.00 and, if so, would you please grant the necessary authority to purchase the enclosed bill of material?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G.

I am now in receipt of the attached two accounts, which are very unusual, and I might say that in my long experience in this Branch I have no recollection of ever having received similar ones. I doubt very much if we can consider these accounts. In the first place, the teacher had no right to authorize transportation to persons doing the work, and as regards voucher No. 98, it is not our usual practice to provide food and lodging for persons who are engaged in making repairs to any of our schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure.\n| Date | Description                  | Quantity | Price |\n|------|-----------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Apr. 1 | To 1 scrub brush            |          | .30   |\n| 5    | To 5 pkgs. #1 Flite         |          | 1.00  |\n|      | 4 pkgs. #6 Flite            |          | 1.00  |\n|      | 3 rolls wallpaper           |          | .50   |\n|      | 16 yds. border              |          | .06   |\n|      | 2 rolls ceiling             |          | .30   |\n|      | 2 rolls wallpaper           |          | .75   |\n|      | 16 yds. border              |          | .06   |\n|      | 1 qt. cream paint           |          | 1.45  |\n|      | 2 - 6\" Paint brushes        |          | 1.75  |\n|      | 1 roll wallpaper            |          | 50    |\n|      | 2 rolls wallpaper           |          | .75   |\n|      | 1 qt. turps                 |          | 2.00  |\n\nTotal: $22.87\n\nSignature: Marita Raschotte\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506A**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: F.

Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nRe Mississauga School:\n\nYou are already aware that this school was burned to the ground on the morning of February 4th last. I believe also that Mr. Laurence has informed you we are making every effort to keep classes running and provide a place where they may be held.\n\nMr. Paul Berthelot, the Chiblows and I saved enough desks to seat all the children at present in attendance. The reading library was also saved as well as the teacher's desk and its contents. We were also able to prevent the sheds from burning, so the fire wood and coal are safe. What we did not have time to save were the children's books from the desks, although we did save some and a good many had been taken home for night lessons. However, Mr. Berthelot has managed, through friends in Blind River, to collect enough supplies for the children to be able to resume classes immediately. He has even secured the loan of a large movable blackboard.\n\nIt was suggested we try to obtain the use of Mississauga Inn as a school house. Mr. Laurence, after conferring with one of the owners in Sault Ste. Marie, tells me this is impossible for the present.\n\nThe suggestion which I am prepared to carry out immediately is the temporary loan of the church for classes until some other arrangement can be made, or until the end of the spring term. The Right Reverend Bishop Dignan has already granted verbal permission but he warned me at the same time that I must secure some guarantees from the Department that the building would not suffer from the wear and tear of classes.\nAccordingly I put forward the following agreement:\n\nThe Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie freely grants the use of the Catholic Church at Mississauga for classes outside those times when the Blessed Sacrament is reserved, until such time as a more suitable place can be found, up until the end of June, 1946.\n\nNo rent will be charged for the use of building or furniture but the Department will be expected to provide the fuel for heating the premises. Moreover the Department will pay for the repair of any positive damage caused by the pupils or consequent upon the use of the building as a class room. Also the Department will make the usual allowance for scrubbing and cleaning.\n\nFinally, if the building is used for classes for the remainder of the school year, i.e., until the end of June, 1946, the Department will pay to have the floor varnished and the interior of the church proper repainted.\n\nI sincerely hope that the Department will accept this offer without delay.\n\nYours very truly\n\nJ. E. McKey, S. J.\nMissionary.\nOttawa, February 12, 1946.\n\nDear Father McKey:\n\nI have delayed answering your letter of the 8th instant, in connection with the Mississauga School, in view of our telephone conversation.\n\nAs I recall, I suggested that we allow rent at the rate of $25.00 a month in lieu of making any repairs that might be considered necessary when we give up occupancy.\n\nIt was understood, of course, that we would supply the fuel required and make an allowance for janitor service. If my suggestion meets with the approval of His Excellency Bishop Dignan, you may arrange to have the school re-opened immediately. You should, of course, advise me of your acceptance, in order that I may notify the Indian Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. E.

He has also given me authority to arrange any details which may need attention. I therefore agree to rent the building for 25 dollars per month up until the end of June of this year. No alterations will be necessary beyond the removal of the church benches in the front part of the building and the erection of a moveable blackboard. I will have a curtain drawn between the main body of the church and the sanctuary. This will give plenty of room for the holding of classes without interfering with the conducting of religious services at the regular times.\n\nMr. Berthelot has borrowed a blackboard for the time being and sufficient books and supplies. He is ready to resume classes tomorrow morning.\n\nRejoicing in the evident care you have for those under your charge and thanking you for your kind cooperation, I remain\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I know that you have all the facts and that the requisite reports and so forth have been made, but it has struck me that there might be something I could do as an individual to help. Unfortunately I am very much a novice in any dealings with the machinery of government. I am very anxious to see a new school at Mississauga. I am eager to be of service in any way I can. But I am quite at a loss where to turn. Hence I come to you as the one most able to give me sound advice.\n\nIs there anyone to whom I should write or have others write? Or would it do any good to take the matter up with the local Member? I certainly have no desire to interfere in what should not concern me, and much less do I wish to hinder the efforts you yourself are making in this regard. And on the other hand, perhaps, in view of the emphasis which the Department is placing on education this year, you will be able to give me assurance that any endeavours on my part will be in no way necessary.\n\nHoping sincerely that you will give me the benefit of your experience and intimate knowledge of these affairs, I remain\n\nYours faithfully in the Sacred Heart\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6143, File 409-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 14, 1946.\n\nDear Father McKey:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the school situation at the Mississauga Reserve.\n\nI might as well be very frank with you and state that at the present time I cannot see any prospect of erecting a new school this summer.\n\nThis particular school was destroyed by fire after we had prepared our Estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47 and, consequently, no funds were provided.\n\nThere is also an additional reason. We require a number of schools all over the Dominion. In many cases the situation is similar to that at Mississauga. In other cases the buildings are so old that they should have been replaced before this, but due to war conditions it was not possible to do so.\n\nWhen preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year, we requested funds for the erection of a number of schools throughout Canada. However, early in the present calendar year, you will remember that it was officially decided to concentrate on the erection of private homes throughout the country and, as a consequence, our public building program has been greatly curtailed. Owing to the difficulty of securing materials, we are extremely doubtful if we will be able to erect even the small number of buildings which we proposed to build.\n\nI am sorry that I have to give you such a dismal reply, but it is simply due to conditions over which we have no control.\n\nWith kind personal regards, Yours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

He has no authority to sell the articles mentioned. As a matter of fact, neither you nor I would have that authority without the approval of the Salvage Officer. What price was secured for the articles and where is the money received from this sale? I would appreciate having your reply at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nJ. E. McKey, S. J.\nSpanish, Ontario\nMay 9th, 1946\n\nMr. R. P. G. Laurence\nIndian Agent\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Laurence,\n\nPursuant to our conversation of the 6th instant re the Mississauga school, it seems good that I should set forth my opinion.\n\nIn the first place I think the fact that there will be upwards of twenty-three pupils who should be in school there next year merits our very serious attention.\n\nSecondly, I am convinced the use of the church next year will not be practical. The arrangement has been fairly successful this year because of the fact that the teacher was a young man, and that he lived in town and could go back and forth morning and night. If the teacher were a woman, I could not allow her to use my room, even during the day. It is possible that some one might be found who would be willing to confine herself to the church proper and commute back and forth from town if taxi service were provided for her, but I am inclined to doubt this very much.\n\nAnother solution might be regular and adequate bus service to the school in Blind River. This would depend too on the accommodations of the school and the willingness of the teaching staff to stretch their resources. On this I am not prepared to say anything at present.\n\nThe only real solution is a new school immediately, and a salary for the teacher adequate to attract a good one. I know there is a housing shortage but I think everyone will agree that schools should hold an AI priority, ahead of churches and even ahead of dwellings.\n\nIf a school is begun this summer to be completed in the fall, classes could be held in the church during the warm weather until they could be moved.\ninto the school. It is probable that a teacher could be persuaded to put up with this inconvenience if she has the prospect of better conditions constantly before her eyes.\n\nHoping that these views correspond fairly closely with your own, and that they will meet with the approval of the Department,\n\nI remain\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. E. [Signature]\n\n(Missionary)\nMay 21st, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nOn my last visit to the Mississauga Reserve, I took up with Father J.E. McKey, the Parish Priest, the matter of using the church as a school next winter.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from him regarding this subject. I understand that the present teacher will not be available for next year. Last winter after the school burned down, I inquired regarding accommodation for the children at the school in Blind River but was advised that there was no room for them as the schools there were already over accommodated.\n\nAs there is no place on the Reserve for a teacher to live if a new school cannot be built this summer, then the only solution would be for the teacher to commute back and forth from Blind River by taxi service, providing she was willing to confine herself to the church proper as stated in Father McKey's letter.\n\nThe cost of taxi service would be approximately $2.00 per day, but even this arrangement would not be very satisfactory during the cold weather.\n\nR.P.G.

Referring to the information contained in the last two paragraphs of your letter, it is extremely difficult for us to make any decision if the cost of transporting a teacher daily from Blind River would be approximately $400.00 for the academic year, and I note there is no place on the Reserve where you can consider suitable for a teacher to live.\n\nMight I suggest that you again discuss the matter with Father McKey, and if the church authorities are willing to allow you the use of the church for another year, you might make further inquiries, and see if you can at least obtain rooms in some Indian's house, where the teacher could have her quarters.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPaul Berthelot:\n\nFor account with Leo Tremblay:\nFor transportation from Blind River to Mississauga.\n\nMay 6th - $1.00\n7th - $1.00\nOne way fare:\n9th - $1.00\n10th - $1.00\n13th - $1.00\n14th - $1.00\n15th - $1.00\n16th - $1.00\n17th - $1.00\n20th - $1.00\n21st - $1.00\n22nd - $1.00\n23rd - $1.00\n\nTotal $14.00\n\nLeo Tremblay\nMay 16/46\n\nR.

He thought that you might give him the necessary authority and in this way he would be recompensed for articles he lost in the fire. The material mentioned is still stored in the school shed with the exception of the Day Couch which was being spoiled through dampness so I moved it along with two chairs to the Agent's Departmental Cabin on the Spanish River Reserve, where they will be stored until required.\n\nR.F.G.

None of these conveniences were in any of the schools in this agency when they were first built. Water has always been a problem at the Mississauga and Serpent River Schools on account of the distance it had to be carried.\n\nI would recommend that approximately $500.00 be set aside for each of these schools, for the purpose of drilling for water to see if it could not be obtained closer, and if possible, right in the school.\n\nR.P.G.

The final payment usually includes the contractors' profit on the over-all cost of labour and material involved in carrying out the work.\n\nThe Cost Inspection and Audit Division have offices located in all the provinces and is therefore prepared to handle, without undue delay, whatever audit work it may be necessary to perform on account of the various Government Departments.\n\nIt is suggested that just as soon as work is contemplated, cost-plus or otherwise, prior to entering into any negotiations, you first obtain an encumbrance certificate from this office certifying that the necessary funds are available.\n\nW.

Immediately upon the making of any decision by the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust all wages and hours and classifications of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed by them for any period of time wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed hereafter by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payments shall be made as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, addresses and of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attesting by sworn declaration, however, (1) the rate of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages remaining unpaid. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded has been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable to him. His request under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister obtained; such approval shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be executed shall be sublet.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6143, File 409-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe contractor has submitted his claims, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Final) for this project, showing an expenditure including Fee of $16,158.47.\n\nAUTHORIZATION\n\nAgreement dated September 29, 1947, between The Minister of Mines and Resources and George V. Hannah authorized the construction of a one room school and teacher's residence on the Mississauga Indian Reserve, at cost of the work plus a Fee of $1,000.00.\n\nIt is noted that in a letter from our Department dated Ottawa September 23, 1947 the estimated cost is quoted as being $6,000.00.\n\nSUPERVISION\n\nThe work was supervised by Mr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Mr. Laurence had authority to approve all charges (see letter dated Ottawa September 23, 1947) and has signed all vouchers, payrolls and Form 1064, indicating his approval.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF EXPENDITURES\n\nLabour\nWages $5,726.01\nVacation Pay 94.87\nWorkmen's Compensation Insurance 157.88\nUnemployment Insurance 30.98\nP.L. & P.D. Insurance 29.02 $6,038.08\n\nMaterial and Expenses\nMiscellaneous Expenses 7,062.16\nRoom Rent 378.00\nSubcontracts 956.28\nContractor's Expenditures $14,460.47\nGarbage 675.00\nFee 1,000.00\nTotal Cost $16,158.47\n\nPROGRESS CLAIMS\n\nRecovery of expenditures on claims 1 - 4 was received by means of interim progress certificates.\n\nRATES\n\nWage rates were approved by the Indian Agent. Daily labour reports were test-checked to payrolls about 95% and the compilation of the payrolls test-checked approximately 95%.\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION INSURANCE\n\nWorkmen's Compensation Insurance was charged at the rate of 5\u00a2. This has been established as the actual rate for 1947. The provisional rate for 1948 was reduced to 2.75\u00a2, and attached to claim 5 as a credit of $5.30 to cover this reduction. This credit did not cover insurance paid on Vacation Pay, but as this only amounted to .66 no correction was made.\nCredit is also attached amounting to $11.61 covering rebate of insurance on excess wages.\n\nAttached to this final report is a letter from the Workmen's Compensation Board stating the contractor is in good standing.\n\nThis charge is in accordance with the contract.\n\nThe contractor made some doors, sash and cupboards in his shop. I have verified the cost by examination of the work sheets.\n\nReceiving reports covering receipt of material at the project were not kept by the contractor. We have therefore been unable to verify the quantities of material.\n\nComputations, extensions and additions of vouchers were tested checked approximately 95%.\n\nRoom rent of $378.00 and board of $351.24 were paid by the contractor for room and board for his employees. These charges were approved by the Indian Agent.\n\nSubcontracts (2) consist of plumbing and installation of a furnace. These charges are approved by the Indian Agent. Attached to the final claim is a statutory declaration from the subcontractor who installed the furnace. We did not require statutory declaration from the plumber as more than 50 days have elapsed since he submitted his final claim.\n\nMost of the materials had to be trucked from Sault Ste. Marie to the site and the Indian Agent approved a rate of $15.00 a trip. This charge amounts to $675.00.\n\nThe fee claimed of $1,000.00 is in accordance with the contract.\n\nThe Indian Agent states that no inventories remain. Extra material was returned and credited in progress claims.\n\nWages and suppliers' invoices were paid by cheque. Paid cheques returned from the bank were examined, and I have ascertained that all charges have been paid with the exception of one outstanding cheque:\n\nAlbert Coleman Claim #5 Invoice Dec. 10, 1947 $6.45.\n\nI hereby certify that I have made an examination of the accounts and records of George V. Hannah insofar as they pertain to this contract, and I have received the information requested, and that subject to the comments of this report, the total cost of the work as shown by the above accounts and records, is $16,135.47 including payment to the contractor of $675.00 for cartage and his fee of $1,000.00.\n\nApproved:\n\nK.M.

Motet is about thirty miles east of the Pic River Reserve.\n\nRegarding Indian Education I think that a farm should be connected with the school on every Reserve. It is apparently impossible to teach the old people to farm but should be easy to teach the young.\n\nThe teachers at St. Joseph's Boarding School tell me that most of their pupils forget what was learned at school just as soon as they get back on the Reserve. I know that the boys and girls on the Fort William Reserve are growing up without any ambition except perhaps to do as their parents do.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Yolland, Manager of the Hudson Bay Co., which gives full particulars.\n\nIt would cost about $500 to equip this school complete.

If nothing is done why should I have to resign up. I do not want to go to the expense of buying bed &c etc because as I understand from Father Belanger he may give me thirty day notice any day.

Well now it was I assure you a hard task to open this school owing to the fact the pupils were not into the ways of going to school and again they\nwere dirty in person & habits and extremely untidy in their manner of dressing. Since then there has been a change in them which is remarkable, and I am pleased to say they are doing nicely.

Mr. Brown, they needed badly, in respect to the Protestant he spoke off, which I have seen of this fellow and was also acquainted with him whilst I was at Regina. I think myself he has no cause to send such a disrespectful letter to a girl like the copy enclosed, and a man in the position he claims to be ought to be ashamed of himself. He has also passed the remark that if a Protestant teacher came here, he would advise the Ind. Children not to go to school, now what do you think Mr. Brown of a narrow minded man like that. I worked hard myself to get this school here, also getting permission from the Bishop of Regina, for the use of the building, he gave me permission to use same, but mentioned I would prefer having a Protestant teacher, but speaking personally, I did not mind whether the teacher was Catholic or Protestant, so I said to Mr. Brown that a day school was for children to learn to read and write etc., not to discuss religion. I hope and trust Mr. Brown, that you will do your best to keep\nthis teacher here, has she told me that she does not wish to leave now, after getting the Indian children in the way?

The attendance has kept up fairly good until lately, and would again if we could get a teacher to take an interest in the school.\n\nYour Truly,\n\nL. Yelland\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th ultimo, I would say that after taking everything into consideration, I think that it would be in the best interests of the school if Miss Mercier could be removed. I wrote her last week and advised her to resign and she is satisfied to do this but would like to stay until March 3rd. Rev. Chas Belanger S.J. visited the school on January 9th and gave her thirty days notice to vacate but she does not recognize his authority to discharge her.\n\nThe principal complaint against Miss Mercier is that she sometimes keeps late hours and is therefore too tired to give proper attention to her pupils. When the priest goes away the children stay away from school but when he goes away they attend again.\n\nKindly advise if the Dept is satisfied to have her resign and leave at end of March or before. The priest would like to have them sent away at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R.

We note that there is no school building at Mobert, and the conducting of school in an Indian residence would be unsatisfactory.

He considers it advisable to experiment with one Reserve, and suggests Pic as the most promising. A summer school might be granted here, as there is an old schoolhouse. Desks would be required and, if the work was continued during the winter months, arrangements would have to be made to put the building in good shape.\n\nI have not suggested to Mr. Burk that he advocate commencing a school at Pic, but if the demand is strong enough we might favourably consider the matter.\n\nPic, Sand Point,\nGull Bay & Whitesand\nalready opened.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Vesey, teacher of the Mobert Indian Day School, which was temporary open on November 4th, last, I wish to advise I have today received a letter from Mr. Vesey advising he was under the impression the salary would be $90.00 per teaching month, and advised I had informed him of this amount in this office.\n\nWhen communicating with the Department regarding this salary I was under the impression $85.00 per teaching month was first recommended by myself when speaking to Mr. Vesey. Mr. Vesey apparently is extremely disappointed and requested me to write to the Department to ascertain if it would be possible to pay him $90.00 per teaching month from the 4th of November last.\n\nAs Mr. Vesey holds a second class certain, and as I experienced great difficulty in obtaining a teacher for this school, would it not be possible to adhere to his request?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Vesey, teacher of the Mobert Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as there appears to have been a misapprehension on the part of Mr. Vesey as to the salary he was to receive, the Department will allow him an increase of $5 per month in his present salary from the 1st of April, last, the beginning of the new fiscal year. This will make his salary from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month, and you will be good enough to advise him accordingly. As our books are closed for the last fiscal year, we regret that it will not be possible to grant him the increase at the above rate from the date he began duties at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Vesey will never make a successful teacher in the Indian Schools and I would suggest that a properly qualified and experienced teacher be procured.\nOttawa, July 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mobert Indian Day School, states, with reference to the services of George W. Vesey, the teacher, that the standing of the classes in this school shows that proper teaching has not been done. The Inspector states, further, that Mr. Vesey will never make a successful teacher in an Indian school and he suggests that a properly qualified and experienced teacher be secured.\n\nI should be pleased to have your views at an early date, regarding the suggestion of the Inspector, that the services of another teacher be engaged. The Department is aware of the difficulty of obtaining a teacher for this isolated school. If you recommend that the services of Mr. Vesey be dispensed with, could you obtain a qualified teacher to succeed him. Your early reply regarding this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

I note the Inspector states the teacher, Mr. G. W. Vesey, will never make a successful teacher in Indian schools and suggests that a proper qualified and experienced teacher be secured. In reply I would say several applications were received for this school and when advised of the location the applicants, with the exception of Mr. Vesey, did not wish to teach in such an isolated location. Consequently Mr. Vesey was engaged.\n\nThe writer was aware of the fact that Mr. Vesey was not as successful as other teachers in this Agency, but as I was unable to fill his place his services have been retained.\n\nAs it is extremely difficult to secure qualified teachers for isolated schools in this Agency I would suggest that the matter be left in abeyance until I ascertain if it will be possible to secure another teacher for the Mobert School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department has noted the difficulty in obtaining the services of a qualified teacher for this isolated school, and will approve of your suggestion that the matter of a change in teacher be left in abeyance until you are able to ascertain if it will be possible to secure another teacher.

A.\nOttawa, August 20, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nPursuant to our conversation yesterday, I have to confirm your appointment as teacher of the Mobert Indian Day School - salary to be at the rate of $85 per teaching month. This school is not far from White River, on the main line of the P. R. At the present time, there are rented buildings being used for classroom and for teacher's residence, but there is in course of erection a building with both functions combined. The teacher's residence will be furnished and heated. At a later date, I shall write, letting you know when to report for duty.\n\nThe Indian agent for this locality is Mr. J. G. Burk, Port Arthur, and you should look to him for advice and instructions in connection with your duties. All reports and returns are forwarded to his office.\n\nI may say that Mobert is approximately 1\u00bd miles from the station at King, where there is an operator. The Imperial Limited stops on demand. At Eganville which is an Indian village, there is a Catholic church and a Hudson Bay store. The Hudson Bay manager and his wife will be the only white residents, as the priest comes only at intervals. I think it would be a good plan for you to take with you a little sister for company. There will be plenty of room in the teacher's quarters and she could attend class at your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Ethel St. Louis,\nR. R. No. 4,\nEganville,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nConfirming your wire of the 19th inst., regarding the reopening of the Mobert Indian Day School for the fall term, I beg to advise the Mobert and Pic Schools were both kept open until the end of July, as the Indians on these Reserves derive their living from hunting in the winter and berry picking in the summertime. Consequently the school will not be reopened until the 1st of October.\n\nI note Miss Ethel St. Louis has been appointed as teacher for this school.\n\nWith reference to the Mobert Indian Day School, I beg to report a new combined school and residence is now under construction and should be completed by the latter end of October. The school is situated on a small hill overlooking the lake, and is approximately half a mile from the C. P. R. station at King.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company have a post which is situated 500 feet from the school, and three white families are living within a few hundred feet of the Reserve. Consequently it is presumed the teacher will not be lonely.\n\nWould you kindly advise if you wish me to communicate with Miss St. Louis?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nEspanola, Ont.\nP.O. No. 4,\nAug 21, 1930\n\nMr. W. D. Murray,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRobert -\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast week, I accepted a position as teacher in one of your schools at Robert. I wish to subscribe for a magazine, \"The School,\" and am in doubt as to whether mail is addressed to Robert or Ring. Would you be kind enough to let me know the correct address? I wish also to state that my parents are quite willing to let me go there to teach.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEthel St. Lewis\nOttawa, August 26th, 1930.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to say that the post office address is Mobert, Ont.\n\nI note you desire to subscribe to a school magazine and, in this connection, I may say that the Department supplies, free of charge, to other teachers desiring same, \"The Canadian Teacher\". Please let me know if this magazine is suitable for you and, if so, I will arrange to have an order placed.\n\nOwing to local conditions, it has been customary in the past to take the annual summer holidays during August and September. Consequently, this school was kept open until July 31st, last, and it is not desired to have it reopened until October 1st, 1930. I trust that you will be at the school on that date and Mr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont., will be instructed to give you every possible assistance.\n\nA new combined school and teacher's residence is now under construction and will be completed by the latter end of October, but the Department desires the school opened on the first of October and classes conducted in the old building until the new one is ready for occupation.\n\nThe railway station for this school is King, on the G. P. R., and the station is approximately a half mile from the school. At Mobert, the Hudson's Bay Company have a post, which is situated five hundred feet from the school and three white families are living within a few hundred feet of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Ethel St. Louis,\nR.

I began teaching in the new school-room last Monday. It is quite a change from the old one. I like my situation very much and like the people they are exceedingly good to me. I can truthfully say, that they have kept me supplied with wild meat since I am here.\n\nAll the children are very proud.\nand thank you sincerely for all you have done for me.\n\nYours sincerely,\nMary Isabel St. Louis.\n\nof their new quarters. I have difficulty at times making the younger pupils understand me, but I always manage to in the end.\n\nI have my nine year old sister with me. She is good company and has made up with all the little Indian girls. She knows more about their business than I do.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Burk, has been up to see me three times since my arrival, and is always ready to encourage, suggest, and offer a helping hand. He was just saying that some of the older teachers would be put out if they knew that a young, inexperienced teacher had the nicest building of any of the reserves.\n\nI will do my best toward educating these people of the wilderness,\nOttawa, November 3, 1930.\n\nDear Miss St. Louis:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo and am very pleased to learn that you are comfortably situated in the new school and that you are thoroughly enjoying your work.

Her energy and enthusiasm are as great as ever. I arrived at Mobert quite unexpectedly, and the teacher had not the slightest idea that I was on my way. I was very much struck with the tidy and tasteful appearance of the teacher, which, in itself alone, I should say, should have its effect upon her charges.\n\nI happened to meet the Anglican Missionary who has charge of this district (Major Armour is his name, I think). Some few days ago I met him again at Port Arthur. He spoke most enthusiastically of Miss St. Louis, and strongly urged me to ask the Department to keep her at Mobert as long as possible.\n\nMobert ranks well in the forefront of those Indian Day Schools visited by me and staffed by lay teachers.\nOttawa, May 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mobert Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the splendid services being performed by Miss St. Louis, and recommends that she be retained as long as possible. He states that the Mobert school ranks well in the forefront of the Indian day schools visited by him.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will communicate with Miss St. Louis, and ascertain whether she will be prepared to continue as teacher of this school for the next school year, beginning on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Hamer, former teacher at the Sand Point Day School.\n\nUnfortunately, as the Department has already been informed, Miss Hamer and the priest in this Agency do not agree; and consequently Miss Hamer could not be transferred to Mobert School. Under the circumstances would it be possible to transfer a teacher from some other Agency to Mobert, and have Miss Hamer take her place.\n\nAt a recent interview with Miss Hamer I have been informed her father is out of work, and consequently she desires to teach if she can possibly secure a position. Under the circumstances I would appreciate it very much if the Department could possibly see their way clear to employ Miss Hamer in another Agency and have a teacher transferred to Mobert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSchreiber, Ontario,\nSept. 1, 1932.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been notified by Mr. Greening that the position as teacher at Robert is again vacant. I shall be very pleased to accept this position, and can assure you that I shall strive to discharge my duties sincerely and efficiently.\n\nI shall greatly appreciate any necessary information you may be able to offer me about the school.\n\nWith my most sincere thanks,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJosephine W.

Scott, of Schreiber, Ontario, which has been recommended by Mr. Greening. Mr. Greening advised me that Miss Scott is a very capable teacher, and will no doubt be suited for Indian teaching, as she lives in the same locality as Mobert.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would advise if the application is acceptable at their earliest possible convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, September 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing an application from Miss Josephine D. Scott for the position as teacher of the Mobert Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the appointment of Miss Scott is approved, to begin duties October 1st, next. Miss Scott's qualifications have not been stated, and I would request that you furnish full information regarding same. You might also state her age and previous teaching experience. The salary allowed her would depend upon the qualifications which she possesses. When we have this information, you will be advised as to the salary she will be allowed.\n\nI have also your letter regarding Miss V. Hamer, former teacher at the Sand Point Indian Day School. At the present time there is no vacancy to which she could be appointed. She will be kept in mind, however, and will be favourably considered for appointment to the first suitable vacancy that occurs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The section-foreman has 1 child, and 2 of the section hands have 2 children each, and an English speaking family have 1 child, making a total of 6.\n\nAs our Indian Day School is the only school in the vicinity I would be pleased if the department would advise if it would be in order to allow these children to attend our school. It will be understood if the school is crowded the white children will not be allowed to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, requesting to be advised if it would be in order to permit several children of white families residing in the vicinity of the Mobert Reserve to attend the Mobert Indian Day School. It is noted that there is a total of six white children who wish to attend.\n\nProvided the teacher of the Mobert School is willing to add the extra work to her regular duties in teaching the Indian children, and also provided there is accommodation for the white children, this Department would approve of their being allowed to attend. However, if at any time the classroom becomes crowded through the attendance of Indian children, the privilege of allowing the white children to attend will have to be discontinued. You may advise the teacher of the Mobert School and the white parents interested accordingly.\n\nThe teacher should not include the names of these children on the quarterly returns which she prepares and forwards to the Department through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Scott, who was appointed teacher of the Nobert Indian Day School, in which she furnishes particulars regarding her qualifications, etc.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that she possesses a second class interim certificate only and has had no previous experience. As you have already been informed by official letter of the 7th ultimo, the Department has approved of Miss Scott's appointment. The salary allowed her, in view of her qualifications, will be at the rate of $60 per teaching month, less 10 percent during the present fiscal year.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nMOBERT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL:\n\nWith reference to management, I regret to inform you that the teacher has very little control over the children. I brought this to the teacher's attention on several occasions, and also lectured the children. I was under the impression that better control would be exercised. Unfortunately I recently received a letter from the Chief, advising that the children did not obey the teacher. It is my belief a change should be made at this school, as the teacher and pupils are making no headway.\nOttawa, May 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your report for the month of March, last, on the services being performed by Miss Josephine D. Scott, teacher of the Robert Indian Day School. In view of this report, it is considered that it would be advisable, in the interests of the work, that a change of teacher be made for the school year commencing September first, next. It is noted that Miss Scott has little control over the children and that the pupils are making little or no progress. I would request, therefore, that you inform her that her services will not be required after the end of June, next, when this school closes for the summer holidays.\n\nIn due course, you should endeavour to engage the services of a qualified teacher for this school, in time to begin duties on or about September first, next. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicants for the position should be forwarded for the consideration and approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G.

It is presumed that you have already informed Miss Scott that her services will not be required for the next academic year.\n\nMrs. S. A. Prudhomme has applied direct to the Department. We are aware that she is a qualified teacher, with considerable experience, and, no doubt, would be able to handle the Mobert School quite satisfactorily.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter from Inspector Greening which is self-explanatory. I may say Mr. Greening and myself have gone over the applications and both agreed that Miss Cazaly, who has had former experience in Indian Schools would be especially suited for the vacancy at Mobert.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would advise at their earliest convenience which application they wish to accept for the Mobert Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nDear Mr. Burk,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th August, and have considered Mrs. Prud'homme's application for the school at Moabert, together with the other applications you handed me this morning.\n\nMrs. Prud'homme, I imagine, should prove a good teacher for Moabert.\n\nThere is another young lady also whose case came to my attention recently, viz., Miss I.S. Cazaly. Miss Cazaly taught in an Indian Day School at Garden River for some time. I never inspected her school, but I have discussed her case with the local Inspector who did visit her. In fact, as there was thought to be a likely vacancy at one of the Indian Day Schools near Sault Ste. Marie, Mr. Scott Sims, the Missionary and I unanimously agreed that Miss Cazaly was easily the best teacher in sight for the school. It turned out, however, that the school did not fail vacant, and I do not know if Miss Cazaly is at present employed.\n\nHer address, in case you need it, is c/o The Kanawaki Golf Club, P.O.

BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the first instant, regarding a teacher for the Robert Indian Day School, I enclose my memorandum of the 31st ultimo. Indian Agent Burk has advised the Department that Miss Scott was duly notified that her services would not be required at this school after the end of July last.\n\nIn his letter Mr. Burk states that he has received an application from Miss I. S. Cazaly. Miss Cazaly has a second class certificate and taught in an Indian school at Garden River for a short time about two years ago.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, December 12th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Greening's report regarding his inspection of the Mobert Indian Day School on the 22nd ultimo.\n\nThis report reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The difficulty is that the Indians at Mobert have lost interest in the school. The Chief called to see me and told me that, in spite of his best endeavours, he was unable to get the children to school. Many of the families, he said, had moved from Mobert rather than send their children to school there. At my visit in May, there were only four children present, so that I was unable to form any estimate of the work that had been done during the year. At this visit, as will be seen in another part of this report, there were seven pupils present. The Chief says that it is the boys who show the greatest reluctance to going to school. I would imagine that the pupils at this school are not so well advanced as they were when Miss St. Louis left; this condition, no doubt, being the result of lack of interest and poor attendance. Unless the available children can be got to attend school, the work being done hardly warrants the expenditure being made.\"\n\n\"The Reserve Constable (Bonanish by name, I believe) has done very little to assist the teacher in securing attendance. Indeed, he is one of those who have left the reserve.\"\n\nThe Department would appreciate receiving from you a full report regarding the conditions at Mobert. You might let me know the approximate number of children of school age at that point and what steps you have taken to secure a more regular attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Come on No. 4 with insurance\n\"adjustor stop. Leaving immediately for Mobert\n\"with carpenter detailed report following\".\n\nI beg to report I left on the first available\ntrain for Mobert to investigate this fire.\n\nThe fire apparently originated\nfrom an over-heated pipe. The pipe did not\nfit the pipe hole in the chimney snugly\nso the foreman was compelled to fill this\nspace with concrete. A large piece of\nthis cement had dried and fallen out leaving\na small space where sparks might have\npenetrated. Unfortunately the teacher had\nneglected to turn the damper off in the\npipe. The fire started at 4 a.m. during\nan exceptionally cold spell and high winds.\n\nI found the teacher suffering\nfrom a nervous shock and extremely worried\nabout her neglect. I did not reprimand her\nat the time as she felt she should resign\nat once. I feel that this might have happened\nin any case, and as the inspector reports that\nshe is doing good work would not recommend\nthat she leave this school.\n\nThe approximate cost of the fire\nshould not exceed $150.00.\n\nA circular letter has been mailed\nto all schools in this Agency urging that the\ngreatest precautions be taken in case of fire.\n\nI regret very much having to report\nthis fire and trust there will be no other such\ninstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, furnishing a report on the fire that occurred at the Hobert Indian Day School on the 4th instant. It is noted that the fire was caused through an overheated pipe, and that the damage will not exceed approximately $150.\n\nYou may take the necessary steps as soon as possible to have the repairs required carried out. You should see that the pipe is properly installed, and that every precaution is taken to see that fire does not recur from the same cause. The Department does not feel that any blame should be attributed to the teacher. Please keep any costs in carrying out the repairs as low as possible, and, when completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe action taken by you in circularizing the schools is approved, and it is hoped that every precaution will be taken by the teachers and that there will be no other such instances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She informed me if an inexpensive stove was purchased for the kitchen it would give sufficient heat to heat her residence, and she would also be able to prepare noonday lunches for the school children.\n\nThe oil stove is very economical to operate for one person, but if Miss St. Louis allows the furnace to go out directly after school is over, and only operates a kitchen stove for cooking and heating her residence it would be much cheaper to purchase a stove.\n\nA very inexpensive stove could be purchased from Batons, which is a combination heater and cooker, for approximately $23.00.\n\nI would suggest that this stove be purchased for the Mobert School, as it will actually pay for itself in a short time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If any stove pipe is required, you may also arrange for the purchase of same.\n\nPlease give the matter of the above purchases your early attention and arrange to have the stove properly set up in the kitchen.\n\nAfter these purchases have been made, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

For example in one month possibly 4 acquisitions from 4 different schools, and the cost of various articles purchased may cost $4.45 as follows:\n\n| School          | Item       | Quantity | Cost |\n|-----------------|------------|----------|------|\n| Robert School   | Broom      | 1        | 1.70 |\n|                 | Express    | 1        | 1.70 |\n| Lake Helen School| Mantles   | 1        | 1.25 |\n| Grand Bay       | Generator  | 1        | .60  |\n| Mission Bay     | Mop        | 1        | .90  |\n\nAs you will note the total amount of these various articles from 4 different schools amount to $4.45. Kindly advise if it will be in order to submit these accounts on the one voucher with separate covering letter heads chargeable to each Indian Day School, or would the Department prefer separate vouchers for each school.\n\nIn conclusion I may say if I was obliged to wait to receive authority to purchase articles that were urgently required, it would be a great inconvenience, especially as I am out of the City a great deal.\n\nI would appreciate the Department's views on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.-G.

Otherwise, you should strictly conform to the instructions contained in circular letter of November 14th, 1932.\n\nSeparate vouchers should be forwarded for each school and, at the same time, you should submit a covering letter stating the reason for making purchases without first securing authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

After a careful inspection of each home I found 85% of the children are undernourished. The teacher has supplied oatmeal, rice, and barley, also cocoa. She paid for these from her own pocket.\n\nI would strongly recommend an allowance of $12.00 for 3 months, as the children on this Reserve are undernourished and one hot meal would be of great assistance.\n\nI would also recommend purchasing flannelette and wool for sewing classes which will not exceed $10.00. The teacher advised she would mend the children's clothing, teach them how to darn their socks, and make undergarments. Some of the children are running around very poorly clad with the temperature ranging around 40 to 50 below zero. This Reserve is situated a few miles west of White River.\n\nThe following supplies are also required for the school: 7 panes of glass, swede saw, blade, 1 axe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\nOttawa, February 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting that a grant be allowed to purchase supplies for a hot meal for the pupils of the Mobert Indian Day School and that sewing material and a few other supplies be authorized.\n\nThe Department will allow a grant, which must not exceed the total sum of $12.00, towards the purchase of supplies for the pupils' midday lunch for a three month period. You should arrange for the purchase not exceeding the above amount. Further, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the flannelette and wool required for the sewing classes, to an amount not exceeding $10.00. You may also purchase 7 panes of glass, swede saw, blade, and one axe.\n\nPlease obtain accounts covering the cost of the above authorized supplies. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nOn a recent tour of inspection I found that the classroom and living quarters of the Mobert Indian Day School should be kalsomined. The cost will be approximately $7.50 for murescoing 2000 feet in the living quarters including bedroom, and $7.50 for the classroom.\n\nThe floors should be oiled and the wood work varnished which will cost approximately $4.00. The teacher will do the kalsomining and varnishing of wood work free of cost.\n\nI would be pleased to receive authority to purchase the kalsomine and varnish.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

The local firm, who made the initial instalment of the furnace have quoted us a price of $114.00 for the work, which includes expenses and labour for the survey made. I would suggest that this work be completed before the end of the school term, so that the teacher will be present while repairs are being made and would be pleased if the Department would authorize this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to repairs which you state are required at the Mobert Indian day school. I note that you state that an amount of $114.00 will be required to do the necessary work but a review of the material required appears to show that such a large expenditure would not be necessary.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the present fiscal year it was only found possible to include an amount of $925.00 for repairs and improvements at the day schools in the Port Arthur Agency. Nearly all of this amount will be required for the new foundation and other repairs at the McIntyre Bay school and the Department is not in a position to authorize heavy expenditure at the other schools in your Agency this year.\n\nBefore giving any consideration to the repairs which you state should be made at the Mobert school the Department will await further details from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nR. A.

The information given in your letter is not sufficiently definite to permit the Purchasing Agent to secure the repairs required to the furnace.\n\nI would again point out that it appears a very large expenditure for simply repairing the furnace. Would it not be possible to secure a stove at a much smaller cost to properly heat this building?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G.

The labor appears to be very reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say that when the school was constructed we did not make provision for stoves, consequently it would be necessary to have a brick layer construct new openings in the chimney, one for a stove in the classroom and one for a stove in the residence, which I believe would be almost as expensive as the repairs to the furnace. Under the existing circumstances I trust that authorization can be obtained for the repairs to the furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.
