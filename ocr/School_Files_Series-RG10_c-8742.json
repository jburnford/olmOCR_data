New wood shed and toilet have been built at the teachery and new furniture and alterations for the comfort of our teachers. At the Skidegate Reserve a new urinal is being built, and also a new fence is being built at the teachery; there is no doubt that the Indian schools are the best on the Islands; the Indians children of this Agency are very bright, and several are now attending superior schools here; the children are exceptionally good at Needle work, drawing, painting and very musical; the parents are very keen on giving their children a good education. We are not equipped for Manual training, but have a large class room for this purpose at the Massett school as soon as conditions permit an instructor for that work. Basket making also Slate Totem pole Carving was taught at both schools, but this was stopped at the beginning of the war; several Indian drawings and designs have been entered in a competition at the Stanford University, U.S.A.; we have not as yet heard the result of judges; I usually visit the Massett School three times a month and the Skidegate twice a month; Junior Red Cross work is being carried on at both schools. The Massett school has been adopted by the Sir James Barrie Imperial Daughters of the Empire, from which sporting goods etc., have been received for the pupils.\n\nB.B.

Bertson\nGeneral Hauling\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nFor hauling clocks from Wharf\nto School at Old Waverly\n\n$3.00\n\nE.W. Bertson\nI have your letter of April 12th with regard to janitor service at the Masset Indian Day School for acknowledgement. This building, although not new, is in fair condition and with minor repairs, additional equipment and a third teacher (kindergarten) could become one of the finest day schools in the district. In the near future, after the School Inspector's visit, I shall submit several suggestions with regard to these matters for consideration by the Department.\n\nThe question at present is that of satisfactory janitor service. The man who has been engaged for this work has very poor vision and could not satisfactorily perform his duties. At present, due to rising operations and the small remuneration paid for such work, it has been impossible to engage another man. The teachers have taken over the duties for the balance of the term.\n\nHowever, it is not, in my estimation, fair to expect Day School Teachers to be burdened with janitor work in addition to their teaching and supervising duties.\n\nIn a school of this type, janitor's duties should include lighting of fires each morning, sweeping, dusting, washing and oiling of floors when necessary, inspection and cleaning of outside toilets and general supervision of the upkeep of the building.\n\nIt is obvious that no person will assume these duties for the remuneration offered of $12. monthly, which sum works out, on the basis of 21 teaching days per month, at fifty-seven cents per day.\nI would suggest, that since similar conditions exist at the S. Kidegate Indian Day School, where $10.00 monthly is paid, the entire janitor situation be revised with the object in mind of obtaining satisfactory janitor service for which a decent remuneration be paid.\n\nI would recommend that a man willing to assume the duties as mentioned be paid at minimum rate of $25.00 per month. No doubt if this were approved, suitable janitors could be obtained.\n\nThe matter of ventilation has been investigated and several of the haws have been loosened to allow them to be opened providing proper ventilation.\n\nAdvice and decision in the matter of janitor service will be appreciated.\n\nJ.A.

I am not convinced that extensive repairs to the Skidegate teacher's residence or repairs to the Nassett teacherage estimated at $550 are absolutely necessary this year but before giving consideration to Mr. Findlay's proposals, inasmuch as the only provision made in the Estimates for repairs to schools and teacherages, Queen Charlotte Agency, was an item of $50.00 for each school for emergency repairs, I should appreciate being advised what funds the Department can make available from the Education Vote for school buildings in the Agency this year.\n\nD. J. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 31st, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the Queen Charlotte Agency schools and teachers' residences.\n\nAt the present time the Department can only allow an amount of $425. for necessary repairs to these buildings in order to make them habitable for the coming academic year.\n\nIt is hoped that this amount will be sufficient to cover the necessary repairs.\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nQueen Charlotte Agency\n\nMajor D.H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour File: 11-11-3\nSchools and Teacherages\nQueen Charlotte Agency\n\nWith reference to your letter of Aug 5th stating that only $425.00 can be allowed to effect the necessary repairs to schools and teacherages in this Agency, I beg to submit the following:\n\n(1) Desks. Massett and Skidegate Schools.\nNew desks supplied for these schools have not yet been assembled and put in place. Am I correct in assuming that the costs in assembling and installing these would not be included in the $425.00 allowed for repairs to the buildings?\n\nMaterials and labour necessary\n\nMasset: Wood strips for runners $7.00\nLabor, including repair to old desks.\n2 men 36 hours @ $1.00 72.00\n\nSkidegate: Wood strips for runners 5.00\nLabor, including repairs to old desks.\n2 men, 12 hours @ $1.00 24.00\nTotal $108.00\n\nThe work in this connection was held in abeyance pending the outcome of proposed repairs to all buildings, at which time the entire work could have been done. I am proceeding, however, with the assembling and installation of the desks and since the material needed can be obtained locally, I would request that an accountable cheque for $108.00 be forwarded to cover costs of materials and labor.\n\n(2) Schools:\nIn view of the fact that only a limited sum is available, I would suggest that repairs at the Massett school be postponed until next year. There is nothing of an urgent nature needed at this building.\nAt Skidegate however, work must be done to both front and rear porches.\n\nMaterials:\n\n- 6 pc 2 x 12 x 7' = 84 bd ft.\n- 1 pc 6 x 6 x 4' = 12 bd ft.\n- 4 pc 2 x 8 x 4' = 45 bd ft.\n- 3 pc 1 x 6 x 7' = 35 bd ft.\n- Flooring (1 x 4) = 35 bd ft.\n- 2 pc 2 x 6 x 14' = 36 bd ft.\n- 2 pc 8 x 8 x 10' = 107 bd ft.\n- 8 pc 2 x 8 x 6' = 64 bd ft.\n- Flooring (1 x 4) = 84 bd ft.\n\nTotal materials cost = $27.50\n\nCartage = $3.00\nNails and spikes = $2.00\nPaint, \u00bd gal white = $2.50\nLabor, 24 hrs @ $1.00 = $24.00\n\nTotal = $59.00\n\nAll materials will be available locally, and I would request an accountable cheque to cover costs of this work.\n\n(3) Teacherages.\n\nIn view of the fact of the limited amount of money available, it will be impossible to effect repairs sufficient to make the residences much more comfortable than they are at present.\n\nThe Massett residence will have to be allowed to stand as it is for another term. Some minor repairs are indicated however for security reasons.\n\nDoors: Repairs to rear door frame\n- Lumber = $5.00\n- Labor 1 man 6 hrs @ $1.00 = $6.00\n\nGlass: 8 panes 9 x 13\n- Labor 1 man 6 hrs @ $1.00 = $6.00\n\nWindow locks\n- 15 Sash locks @ .11 = $1.65\n- Labor 1 man 5 hrs @ $1.00 = $5.00\n\nWindow blinds\n- 6 washable Shadex shades 30\" wide @ .85 = $5.10\n\nTotal = $32.75\nMaterials can be purchased or ordered locally.\n\nSkidegate Residence:\n\nThis building presents a much more difficult problem since the repair work planned was based on the stripping of old wall covering in order to brace the building and line the interior with shiplap. The money available is not sufficient to even attempt this, and should new interior lining of wall board be applied, now, the problem of bracing and applying the shiplap would be an impossible one next year should it be decided at that time to effect major repairs.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would suggest that additional foundation posts be placed in position and existing ones braced; window casings and windows repaired; minor repairs effected on the roof; the shingles re-stained and complete new plumbing installed in the house. Although these repairs will not necessarily add to warmth in the building, they at least will not interfere with completing major repairs when it is possible to have such work done.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 12 Cedar posts                            | 24.00  |\n| 16 pc 2 x 6 x 20' for bracing            | 320 bd ft. | 18.00 |\n| 100 lin ft. 1 x 6 for window casings     | 5.50   |\n| 2 bundles shingles                        | 4.25   |\n| Shingle stain 10 gal.                     | 20.00  |\n| Kitchen sink                              |        |\n| Bathroom sink                             |        |\n| Bath                                      |        |\n| Toilet, complete (4 item)                 | 125.00 |\n| Septic tank, etc                          | 12.00  |\n| Hinges, knobs, locks, nails, putty etc    | 5.00   |\n| Freight and cartage approx                | 20.00  |\n| Labor 2 men 50 hrs @ $1.00                | 100.00 |\n\nTotal: 333.75\n\nThe plumbing situation is important and one which should be remedied.

Mr. Acting Indian Agent Findlay's letter of August 18th in this connection is enclosed, from which it will be noted that urgent repairs to the amount available should be carried out immediately, and that in addition an amount of $108.00 will be required for installation of new desks recently supplied for the Massett and Skidegate Schools, and for repairs to the old desks.\n\nThis expenditure is unavoidable and the repairs listed by Mr. Findlay apparently are urgent. The total expenditures amount to $533., and I would ask the Department to make funds to this amount available.\n\nMr. Findlay has asked that the total be advanced to him and in view of the infrequent mail service to Massett this procedure would seem advisable and is recommended.\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 17th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, file 11-11-3, the Department approves an additional expenditure of $105. for repairs to the schools and teachers residences in the Queen Charlotte Agency.\n\nThis amount is additional to the amount authorized in Colonel Neary's letter of August 21st.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS\nFILE\nSEE CURRENT VOLUME\nMAR 21 1938\nSEP 18 1947\n\nMASSETT DAY SCHOOL\nBUILDINGS ACCOUNTS\n\nCLOSED DECEMBER 13 1947\n\nSEE VOLUME 5\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6402)\n\nFile 828-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nGeneral Administration - 1895 - 1918\n\nFile 828-1, part 2\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1918 - 1937\n\nFile 828-1, part 3\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1937 - 1949\n\nFile 828-3, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nGeneral Administration -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1930 - 1947\n\nFile 828-5, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1926 - 1938\n\nFile 828-5, part 2\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1938 - 1947\n\nFile 828-5, part 3\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1947 - 1949\n\nFile 828-8, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nTeachers' Residence - Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1917 - 1935\n\nFile 828-8, part 2\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Day School -\nTeachers' Residence - Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1936 - 1949\n| Central Register | P.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-5, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Transportation of Teachers - Massett School\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter to Supt. Findlay, an undated copy of which was received here, regarding Queen Charlotte Agency voucher No. 494 in favour of Kurt Lindner General Store, covering transportation of the teachers at the Massett School from the white village to the Reserve, payment of which was not approved. The attached vouchers No. 606 and No. 7 apparently were submitted by Mr. Findlay prior to receipt of your letter and in view of all the circumstances I would ask that the Department's decision with regard to payment of these costs be reconsidered.\n\nIn my letter of August 9th I pointed out that due to the condition of the teacherage at the Massett school it would be necessary to secure other accommodation for the teachers and recommended that the Department approve payment of rental for a house in Massett and transportation charges, which would amount to approximately $378 for the academic year. The alternative to this arrangement would have been an immediate expenditure of almost $1000 to make the teacherage building habitable.\n\nRental of the house to be occupied by the teachers until such time as a new teacher's residence is erected was approved in Mr. Neary's letter of December 21st and in the absence of any advice to the contrary it was presumed that payment of transportation charges was also approved. While I am aware that it is not the general policy of the Department to pay\ntravelling expenses for teachers, in this case I believe that payment is warranted.\n\nW.S.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 11-11-1 dated July 14, 1949.\n\nVoucher No. 502\n\nDate: August 8, 1949\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a report received from Supt. Findlay regarding the earthquake experienced in the Queen Charlotte Islands area on August 21st and subsequent tremors.\n\nWith regard to the damage sustained by the Day Schools, etc., I have authorized Supt. Findlay to have the necessary repairs carried out.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAs advised during our telephone conversation yesterday and as perhaps you had already heard, the Queen Charlotte Islands experienced an earthquake of considerable force on Sunday night, August 21st.\n\nFrom radio reports it would appear that Masset was one spot which received about the heaviest shake-up. Fortunately no one was hurt, although several elderly persons are suffering from nervous reaction to the experience. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that not only buildings and trees practically executed a dance but that the earth undulated in no uncertain fashion.\n\nDamage sustained was chiefly to brick chimneys, house foundations and furnishings. Many homes have lost entire china cabinets containing precious china.\n\nOn the road leading from Masset to the North Beach several cracks in the road are to be seen and at one spot the bottom of the fissure cannot be seen nor can a small pebble dropped in be heard to hit bottom.\n\nMrs. Findlay and I were out at the time of the heaviest quake and upon returning home found the place a regular shambles inside. Bookcases were knocked over, lamps toppled and smashed and pictures on the walls being at a 45 degree angle.\n\nFortunately the kitchen oil range which had been left burning went out. I have the automatic shut off valve working so finely that any undue vibrations cause the flow of oil to be cut off.\n\nDamage reported to date so far as the Agency is concerned is as follows:\n\n1. Masset School brick chimney damaged.\n2. Skidegate School brick chimney down.\n3. Crockery and dishes at Skidegate residence smashed. Both stoves\nthere were moved causing the pipes to come out of the chimney. Damage caused by this has not yet been assessed.\n\n4. Agency Office at Masset dropped 4 to 5 inches at one corner. The brick chimney is cracked and the flashing has parted from the roof. The entire building is sprung.\n\nOther parts of the Islands also suffered with 140,000 gallons of oil being lost at Cumshewa, when tanks fell into the Inlet.\n\nThe local Navy Signal Building suffered $2000.00 damage when a huge 3 foot chimney crashed through the roof and down to the floor below.\n\nSince 9:05 p.m. on Sunday we have felt about a dozen more tremors, the last being about 8:30 last evening.\n\nMany people have not slept for two nights and particularly on Sunday night did residents roam the vicinity as the minor tremors continued throughout the night.\n\nAs stated before we are fortunate that no one was hurt but even now a certain nervous tension still exists. Personally I hope there will be no repetition of the last weekend's excitement.\n\nJ. A. Findlay\nSuperintendent\nQueen Charlotte Agency\n\nP. S. At 1:30 p.m. today after writing this letter another shock was felt, serious enough to cause us to leave the office building.\n\nJAF\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Masset School\n\nI am enclosing for your information Superintendent Findlay's letter of September 15th, with regard to repairs required to the above-mentioned School as a result of the earthquake.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMasset, B.C.\nSept. 15th, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnott,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEarly this afternoon and subsequent to writing a letter regarding repairs at Masset School, a man working on the Agency residence roof called me back to examine the kitchen chimney. These had been examined after the major quake last month but seemingly the tremor this morning had finished what the first one had possibly started.\n\nI found bricks loose just above the flashing and the chimney swaying to the slightest touch. There was danger of the structure collapsing through the roof if a strong wind arose and we proceeded at once to dismantle the chimney brick by brick.\n\nThis will necessitate the re-building of almost 5 feet of brick chimney. I shall have this done as soon as possible.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nSuperintendent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-5, part 3)\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYou will recall our recent conversation concerning the arrangement which was made for the accommodation and transportation of teachers at the Masset Indian Day School, and I attach herewith another letter from Superintendent Findlay with regard to our account with Mr. Kurt Lindner for providing transportation. The agreement with Mr. Lindner was entered into by Mr. Findlay in good faith and since the expenditure has been incurred it would appear that we have no alternative but to pay the account.\n\nAnything you can do to expedite this payment will be greatly appreciated by me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil  \nIndian Commissioner for B.C.  \nFederal Building  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nIt will soon be one year since Mr. Kurt Lindner started to provide transportation for last year's teachers to and from Masset School. He has been to see me again and to say the least is rather annoyed that out of the ten months accounts only one (Oct. 1948) has been paid.\n\nWhile it is understood that it is not usual for teachers' travel expenses to be paid, the arrangement last year was of a special nature and could not be worked any other way.\n\nThe situation has become exceedingly embarrassing and I would urge that efforts be made to settle the matter quickly.\n\nJ.A. Findlay  \nSuperintendent  \nQueen Charlotte Agency\n\nJAP/DMA\nNasset, B.C.,\nSept. 15, 1946.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThe attached vouchers #388, 389 and 390 cover labor charges involved in repairing damage caused by the earthquake at Nasset Indian Day School.\n\nThese repairs were rushed prior to school reopening in order that there would be no delay in commencing the school term.\n\nVouchers covering pipes and other materials needed to effect the repairs will be forwarded as soon as accounts are received.\n\nI have not yet been able to have the Agency Office jacked up or the chimney re-inforced. This will be done as soon as possible.\n\nI may say that hardly a day has passed since the major quake without a mild tremor. This morning at 7:40 there was another fairly strong shake. It would appear that the Islands are in the direct path of the disturbances and the inhabitants are beginning to wonder if the tremors will ever cease. These daily disturbances are keeping people in a state of nervous tension.\n\nI recommend that the attached vouchers be approved.\n\nJ.A.

Findlay - October 7, 1949.\n\nThe teachers' residence at Skidegate was completed last year while the new residence at Masset was completed and ready for occupancy at the beginning of the present term. The Masset teacherage is a modern building complete with furnace, water and electricity. It is hoped that the excellent accommodation thus provided will be an attraction for teachers to remain longer than one term.\n\nBoth day schools suffered from the earthquake of Aug. 21st. The most serious was the almost total collapse of the two brick chimneys at Skidegate School. These had to be dismantled and emergency pipe used in order to permit school to start on time. Materials for these chimneys have been received and work in reconstruction will be commenced as soon as possible.\n\nBrick chimneys at Masset school were also damaged although not as extensively as at Skidegate. Repairs to these and to stove pipes which collapsed have been completed.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. 15 | To: Hauling desks to Masset Indian Day School as per attached account.

Jessup to occupy the teacher's residence in connection with the Massett Indian School when the said building is vacated by Mr. Trainor. Mr. Jessup may continue to occupy the house until it is again required for use of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Benny Eagle,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nOn the retirement of Teacher, Mr. Frank Trainer, I beg to recommend that the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00), be appropriated to repair and paint the school teacher's residence, on Nassett Reserve, while the building is vacant.\n\nMr. Trainer took very little care of the building and grounds. It is a four roomed structure, and badly needs painting, inside and out. The wooden approach requires renewing and the verandah needs repairs. No expenditure was incurred on this building for several years. Living on the Reserve, I would supervise the necessary work, and assure you that the money would be well spent, in preserving the property and proving to the Indians that all buildings should be kept in good shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-8, part 1)\nOttawa, June 12, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo recommending that the sum of $200.00 be appropriated to repair and paint the teacher's residence in connection with the Massett Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable to authorize this expenditure at the present time, as it has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of a letter, dated 12th June instant, in which I am informed \"that the Department is unable to authorize this ($200.00) expenditure on teacher's residence as it has no funds available for this purpose.\"\n\nIn a further letter, dated June 18th, I am informed: \"When the Constable vacates the house you will be good enough to advise the Department as to what repairs are required.\"\n\nIn reply permit me to state that, when the former teacher occupied the house, he kept three dogs and a cat therein. He used the woodshed for a chicken house, and did not improve the grounds, allowing the place to become overgrown with weeds.\n\nAfter he vacated, I fumigated the place, in company with the Constable, and Mr. Jessup washed out the floors and cleaned the walls. The first teacher, Mr. McCenkey, partly painted the residence, six years ago, but the roof was not painted, at any time. After Mr. Trainer left, it was plain that the building required attention, and the grounds also. Before a man and his wife could occupy the place\u2014which Mr. Jessup did not do, up to the time I received your letter\u2014it should be painted inside and outside; the woodshed should be whitewashed; a walk, from the gate to building, should be made, and the ground cleared of weeds and stumps.\n\nI considered that $200.00 would do this work, and make the place habitable. It is a good, little resi-\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-3, part 1)\ndence, well built; but none of the White teachers, since Mr. McCenkey occupied the place, made any improvement to the house, shed, or grounds; Mr. and Mrs. Trimmer kept a large number of chickens and ducks\u2014for commercial purposes\u2014and a number of domestic animals, which did not tend to improve the place. They did no gardening, and I felt that it would go from bad to worse, if an Indian teacher had been allowed to occupy it\u2014hence I recommended that the Constable occupy the premises. There are so many small improvements required, that it would be difficult to make an estimate. I considered that $200.00 would place the premises in good condition. My intention was to hire some person, purchase paint and lumber, and superintend the work, rendering vouchers for same, and keeping down the cost as much as possible. It might be advisable to await Mr. Cloworthy's arrival, before specifying the work needed, to avoid any future expenditure.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 25, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 30th ultimo in reference to repairs and painting of the teacher's residence at Massett Indian Day School, and in reply to say that as it is advisable to place the building in a habitable and sanitary condition, you are requested to do the necessary work as outlined in your letter, as economically as possible, and which must not exceed the estimated cost as stated. The materials to be purchased and labour performed under immediate supervision.\n\nThe work should not be commenced until the arrival of Mr. Clotworthy, when you might consult him as to the colour of painting, etc., that these may be satisfactory to him.\n\nThe accounts to be forwarded, certified by you in the usual manner, for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Besides re-shingling the house and renewing the gutter, part of the foundation was also renewed and other necessary repairs carried out.\n\nAn account for labor, re-shingling, shingles and other repairs to the teacher's former residence, amounting to $19.00 is also enclosed. No authority was obtained for this work as the need or having it done was only known at the time or my visit to Massett. This house, which has two small rooms and kitchen, is situated about a mile from the village and for this reason is most unsuited as a residence for the teacher. It has not been occupied for some years and is falling rapidly into disrepair. As Mr. Mitchell had his men working at the school I thought it a favorable opportunity of having temporary repairs only carried out, until the matter could be taken up by the Department. As it may not again be used as a teacher's residence, I would recommend that it be sold for what it is worth\u2014possibly $200.00, otherwise it is going to be a source of continual expense in keeping it in repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nWEC, J.J.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLetter of June 7th, 1926, on file 157-2-1 from L.H.

Building a fence around lot on which agency building is located.\n\nAs an alternative the teacher also suggests that it might be possible to secure from the Anglican Church, for the teacher's residence, a vacant house close to the school.\n\nOn June 18th a letter was written Mr. Agent Collison requesting him to interview the teacher and discuss the above matters and report to the Department.\n\nIt should be noted that the teacher is at present living in the residence formerly occupied by the Indian Agent at Massett. There is some question at the present time of re-appointing an Indian Agent and if so, the residence now occupied by Mr. Baillie will be required for the new Agent.\n\n18/6/26.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nTELEGRAM\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL THE WORLD\n\n57RA.X. 49 COLLECT N.L.

Baillie.\n\nMatters concerning which Mr. Baillie has written have already been brought to my attention, but principally on account of the large sum already expended on the Agency house this year, I did not consider it advisable to recommend further expenditures at the present time.\n\nWith regard to the papering of the dwelling, as the rooms are well lined and neatly finished with dressed lumber, it does not seem necessary to have them papered, at least for the present.\n\nAs to the condition of the well, there is no doubt that further repairs will be necessary, and a new water tank put in; an expenditure of $10 was authorized recently to put the well in temporary shape.\n\nMr. Baillie states that if a fence was put around the house, he would be able to keep hens and cows. He has already been in residence a year and a half and to my knowledge has not attempted to do any manual labor, or take an interest in the appearance of the property whatsoever during that time, and I very much doubt whether he would ever have the energy to keep livestock, although it would mean much to his family.\n\nIn view of the fact that a new agent is shortly to be appointed for the Islands and the Agency house now occupied temporarily by Mr. Baillie will likely be needed, I would suggest that any further expenditures be deferred until the new agent is appointed. In the event of Mr. Baillie having to vacate his present quarters arrangements might possibly be made to rent the mission house belonging to the Anglican Church at Massett for his use. The house in question has not been occupied for some time and is conveniently situated as a residence for the teacher. Should this suggestion meet with the Department's approval, I shall be glad to take the matter up with the Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWEC JJ.\nOttawa, July 17, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the request made by the teacher of the Massett Indian Day School to have certain repairs made to the agency house, which is being used by him as a residence, and for the providing of a water supply.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to incur any expense in the papering of the dwelling. Mr. Bailey, in a telegram to the Department dated the 10th instant, states that he can obtain a water tank - capacity 1500 gallons - at a price of $60, inclusive of the cost of installation. Please report whether you would recommend that this tank be purchased and if it would overcome the difficulty in providing for the supply of water.\n\nUntil future arrangements are completed for the carrying on of the agency work at this point, the Department is not prepared to take any action in the renting of the mission house as a residence for the teacher. If it is necessary for the teacher to give up his present residence, we would have no objection to your taking this matter up with the church authorities, with a view to ascertaining if they would be prepared to rent the mission house and on what terms.\n\nWe are not prepared to authorize the building of a fence around the lot on which the agency building is located.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nMassey, B.C.\nOct. 24, 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA number of matters in connection with the school and my residence here have been referred to you. I have been advised at different times that you have asked Indian Agent Collin for a report, or (by him) that he has referred the whole matter back to the Department as an Indian Agent is to be appointed some day. I wrote Mr. Collin six weeks ago and have had no reply of any kind from him.\n\nA first toilet was provided at the house. A terra cotta pipe was put in as a drain fifteen years ago. A part of this has been clogged and the whole thing is therefore out of commission. I asked for immediate authority...\nto have the necessary repairs made or other suitable provision made.\n\nThe department provided a cook stove and a heater when I came here two years ago. The driftwood, which is the only kind available, under the present arrangement of having the Indians supply fuel, is very hard to obtain. I have put in several claims, but the stoves are now completely done. It is very doubtful whether the top of the cookstove will hold up until a reply can be received from you.\n\nI cannot afford to buy stoves at this rate and I do not think the department can either.\n\nThe yearly requirement of wood is 26 cords costing at present $160. A year ago last April Mr. Collison wrote me (when I had been here two or three months) asking\nfor an estimate of the wood required for the year. I was not in a position to make a final estimate but stated that \"a minimum of 16 cords would be required.\" In August of the same year I informed him verbally that 20 cords would be needed. No mention was made then of the fact that the department would have to authorize an increase. Last winter payment of certain vouchers for wood was delayed until after March 31st on the ground that the 16 cords authorized had been supplied.\n\nThe letter informing me of the acceptance of my application advised me that \"fuel would be provided.\" We do not want any, but it is well known that the kind of wood that is furnished here has no lasting qualities and the amount used is large. It has worked out as I finally estimated that 20 cords would\nAt the year's requirement. Seven loads are therefore needed to complete the supply of wood necessary to March 31, 1927.\n\nIt would be advisable, I think, if coal was provided, even if a limit of $8160 were made on the annual expenditure by the Department. The chief councillor, Alfred Adams, made the suggestion that arrangements should be made to get coal as no one wants to get wood.\n\nThe water supply has never been properly attended to. The well which holds only a few days' water, owing to the condition of the cobbly, the well cannot be kept in use.\n\nThere are a number of other matters that have not had attention, but the matter of stores, water, fuel and sanitary provision must have immediate attention.\nI would suggest that the department think over regarding the plan and whether or not they are prepared to make an allowance toward the purchase of stores and how much. It is agreeable to this course kindly advise by wire that the change to another kind of fuel has been authorized and authorize the expenditure of $56 to complete the fuel supply of 1925-26 and 1926-27. This is important as arrangements must be made to get new stores within a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHamilton Baillie\n\nP.S. - All matters excepting that of the stores and the proposed change in fuel have been referred to Indian Agent Collison or various occasions without result. Nothing has been heard yet re stores or supplies to house that which I wrote months ago.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 4, 1926.\n\nW. E.

Arrange purchase and forwarding stove and heater of suitable types. Obtain supply fuel required and have necessary repairs made to drain and water supply.

The driftwood, which is the only kind available, is very hard on stoves. I have put in several linings, but the stoves are now completely done. It is very doubtful if the top of the cook stove will hold up until a reply can be received from you.\"\n\nWith reference to the fuel requirement, he states as follows:\n\n\"The yearly requirement is 20 cords, costing at present $160. We do not waste any, but it is well known that the kind furnished here has no lasting qualities, and the amount used is large. It has worked out as I estimated that 20 cords would be the year's requirement. Seven more cords are, therefore, needed to complete the supply of wood necessary to March 31st, 1927.\"\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\n\n- Mr. -\nMr. Baillie has suggested that coal be supplied in place of wood, but, owing to the cost in having this delivered, it is considered that as long as wood can be obtained, we would not be prepared to authorize the furnishing of coal.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, he states that this has never been properly attended to, the water tank holds only a few days' water, and that, owing to the condition of the cribbing, the well cannot be kept in use. In this connection I would refer you to previous correspondence.\n\nWith reference to the drain, he states that a flush toilet was provided at the house, a terra cotta pipe was put in as a drain fifteen years ago, a part of this drain has crumbled, and the whole thing is therefore out of commission.\n\nAs requested in our telegram, the Department would like you to take immediate steps to have the work authorized carried out.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-8, part 1)\nOttawa, March 19, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA request has been made by Mr. L. Hamilton Baillie, teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, that the Department purchase a quantity of furniture which he obtained and is using in the living quarters of himself and his family. He states that this furniture consists of two stoves, a kitchen table, four wood chairs, a bed and two linoleum rugs. He says, further, that owing to the ill health of his wife and the necessity of her procuring medical attention, he is desirous that the Department purchase this equipment, which he values at approximately $140.\n\nI may say that, in cases where a teacher's residence is provided, a small quantity of furnishings is supplied, and, in this case, if you consider that the furniture which Mr. Baillie has on hand would be satisfactory for future use, I should be pleased if you would inform the Department whether you would recommend its purchase. If you consider it advisable to obtain these articles, you should also forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the amount which, in your opinion, would be a fair price for each article. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether the Department can take over this furniture from Mr. Baillie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. James Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset,\nGraham Island, B. C.\nOttawa, March 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, requesting that the Department purchase from you the furniture which you obtained for the use of your living quarters at the Massett Indian Day School, comprising two stoves, a kitchen table, four chairs, a bed and two linoleum rugs. In reply I have to say that you should have forwarded this request through the office of your local Indian agent, as is necessary that we have his report regarding the present value of this furniture and his recommendation in connection with its purchase. We are communicating with Mr. Gillett regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Hamilton Baillie, Esq.,\nMasset, B. C.\nMarch 9, 1927\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I came here two years ago the Department provided the following furniture; two stoves, a kitchen table, four wood chairs, a bed and two linoleum rugs.\n\nIt was necessary for me to buy an additional bed ($32.50), a table ($6.50), 4 wicker chairs ($50), 2 wood arm chairs ($8), linoleum ($30), an extra heater ($12.50), small table ($2).\n\nMy income, as you know, has been $1050. It costs for groceries, meat, vegetables, milk, etc., about $75 per month. Owing to the fact that my wife has not been well, it has been necessary to have...\nsome help in the house.\n\nThis has cost about $15 per month. That is my income is $87.50 per month and my expenses, not including clothing, life insurance, medical fees, etc., are $90. I was able to make $125 during the summer of 1926, but nothing \u2014 1925.\n\nProspects are not good for earning much \u2014 1927.\n\nOwing to their ill health and the necessity of procuring for them medical attention that cannot be had here, it will be necessary to send my wife and one of the children to Vancouver.\n\nAs may be seen I have no surplus funds for this. Can the department take over the furniture, amounting to approximately $140, thus releasing the amount for a very necessary purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to confirm the following night telegram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Department approves appointment Miss McQueen as third teacher, Massett School, from first proximo, with salary at rate one hundred dollars per month. You may purchase supplies for teachers' residence, as mentioned in your letter sixth instant.\"\n\nIt is understood that Miss McQueen's services will only be required from the first of November, next, until approximately the end of April, 1929. You should notify her, in order that she can be at Massett in time to commence duties or about the first proximo.\n\nI am pleased to hear from you, later, as to Miss McQueen's Christian name and also the date upon which she begins duties. Full particulars should also be forwarded as to her qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nRelative to the supplies required for the use of the teachers' residence I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of a bed, spring and mattress for the new teacher. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $15.50. You may also arrange for the purchase of three small dressers for the teachers' bedrooms. It is noted that you estimate the cost of these to be $15 each. Further, you may purchase a wash tub for the use of the teachers. After these supplies have been delivered, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

The department will approve of having the bedrooms and kitchen repapered and kalsomined. We note that the paper, kalsomine and paint will cost approximately $25, and the labour about $30.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the carpenter work carried out in repairing the floor and boards around the base of the house.\n\nThe Department will also approve of installing a hot water tank, with pipe and fittings, to be connected with the bath tub in the house. The cost of the tank, labour, etc., should not exceed the estimate stated in your letter.\n\nAll expense in the above work should be kept as low as possible, and when the work is completed to your satisfaction, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour in having the work performed.\n\nYou should have the above authorized work carried out at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

You may arrange with His Lordship Bishop Rix for the rental of the parsonage to be used as a residence by the teachers. We would agree to pay rental for the parsonage at the rate of $15 per month, which will be paid upon receipt of a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified by you, from time to time. The amount now allowed for the rental of the house at New Massett can be taken off the pay list and, as stated, vouchers should be forwarded for the payment of the rental of the parsonage for the use of the teachers.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will make the necessary arrangements to obtain the parsonage and have the present furniture in the agency house moved into the parsonage before the teachers arrive in September. It is hoped that there is sufficient furnishings on hand for the teachers. If not, a requisition should be forwarded for any further supplies required, giving an estimate of the cost of the various items. Any expenses that may be necessary in the moving of the furniture to the parsonage will be paid upon receipt of a certified voucher from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nOttawa, June 14th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo relative to your moving into the agency building at Massett which is, at present, being used by the teachers as a residence.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Mission House, Massett Reserve.\n\nReplying to your letter No. 157-2-8, of September 16th, I beg to say that I have today received a letter from the Caledonia Synod, offering to sell the Mission House for One Thousand dollars.\n\nI recommend that this house be purchased for this amount, so that it may be permanently the teachers' residence.\n\nThe house was built in 1919. There is sufficient accommodation for three teachers. At present it needs complete painting outside, and three bed-rooms and bath-rooms papered. Approximately Two Hundred Fifty dollars will put the building in good condition. The former price of Twelve Hundred dollars has been reduced on this account.\n\nAttached hereto is a photograph of the house, taken when it was first built.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 3, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 11/259 of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the offer of the Anglican Church to sell the Mission House at Massett for $1000.00\u2014same to be used as a teachers residence. There are no funds for this purpose at the present time but as the Department concurs in your recommendation I have made a note for next years estimates. In the meantime I should like to have a statement from you giving the exact dimensions of this building indicating the type of construction and the year it was built, etc. This statement is required by the Auditor General and should include your valuation of the property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset,\nBritish Columbia.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of December 3rd, 1930, No.157-2-8, I beg to say that the Mission House is of the following dimensions,\n\nLength 36 feet\nWidth 22 \"\nHeight to eaves 15 feet.\n\nIt is of frame construction, built in 1919. On the ground floor there are,\nSitting room\nDining room\nKitchen\nLaundry room\nPantry\n\nOn the upper floor are three bedrooms. There is a brick chimney, with open fireplace in the sitting room.\n\nSince my last letter in connection with this house, the Bishop has visited Massett. The Bishop now wishes to dispose of the piece of land surrounding the house. I have this indicated on the blue print. It contains approximately one and one quarter acres. As you already know the Department has purchased the greater part of this Lot 13. If the Department now takes the piece indicated, the Church will retain only the roughly triangular portion on which the Church stands. The price of the land at the rate at which the other was purchased will be $37.50, making a total of $1037.50 for the house and lot. I consider that this is a reasonable figure.\n\nAs stated before, the house needs painting outside, and bedrooms renovating, also hot water tank.

Upon a visit there a few months ago, I suggested that the land reaching half way between the house and the Church would probably be appreciated by the Department and that for the house and the land a fair price would be $1200. Your agent said he would write you about this matter, and so you have probably heard of it. We would be glad to have the matter settled at an early date. For some time the teachers have been using this house and, so far as I know, no rent has been paid for it. If the purchase is arranged for the $1200, the matter of the rent can be forgotten, but, if otherwise, you will agree with me that rent should be paid. I understand the mission house has proved quite satisfactory to the teachers as a residence.\n\n---\nOttawa, April 11, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIn connection with that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 30th ultimo which refers to the suggested purchase by this Department of the mission house at Massett, Mr. Agent Gillett, in a letter dated February 4th, last, writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Since my last letter in connection with this house, the Bishop has visited Massett. The Bishop now wishes to dispose of the piece of land surrounding the house. I have this indicated on the blue print. It contains approximately one and one quarter acres. As you already know the Department has purchased the greater part of this Lot 13. If the Department now takes the piece indicated, the Church will retain only the roughly triangular portion on which the Church stands. The price of the land at the rate at which the other was purchased will be $37.50, making a total of $1037.50 for the house and lot.\"\n\nIn view of the above, the Department would appreciate you advising if you are prepared to accept the amount mentioned in the Agent's report.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Land Surveyors in the Prince Rupert District, I beg to inform you that our By-law concerning this matter reads as follows:\n\n\"That for the keeping of discipline and for guarding the professional honour of the British Columbia Land Surveyors (under Section 6, Clause (a) of the Act), the following day rate be adopted, viz., $25 and upwards plus all expenses.\"\n\nThe only exception to this rule is where the British Columbia Government employ Land Surveyors for the summer season when they pay them a daily rate of $15 a day from the date of leaving town to the date of returning, Sundays included, together with all expenses and a small monthly camp equipment allowance.\n\nMy Corporation would very much appreciate it if on work of a few days duration only the Department of the Interior would pay our ordinary daily rate of $25.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nB.C.L.S.\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, December 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your B.5823 of July 31st, last, and to my reply of August 4th, regarding the purchase of certain land from the Bishop of Caledonia. I find that, on or before the first week in October, a Prince Rupert surveyor, who was engaged by this Department, supplied your agent, Mr. W. E. Fisher, with tracings in duplicate and linen blue print and legal description. May I suggest that the proposed transfer be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 10th December 1931\n\nDescription\n\nAll that parcel of land containing one acre and forty-five hundredths of an acre, situate in Lot Thirteen, Queen Charlotte District, Province of British Columbia. The said parcel is shown on plan of survey made by Frank D. Rice, British Columbia Land Surveyor, recorded in the Surveys Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs under number B.C.600-B.\nDecember 9, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacINNES.\n\nIt is now necessary to secure an Order in Council, authorizing the purchase of a house and lot at Massett from the Bishop of Caledonia - such property to be used as a teacher's residence for the Indian Day School there. Title has been searched by the Department of Justice, who have in hand the proposed transfer.\n\nThe Department has been paying $180 a year rental for this property, and it is considered in the interests of economy to make the purchase. Under date of April 23rd, last, the Department Architect has certified that he believes the proposed price of $1,037.50 is very reasonable.\nOttawa, December 11, 1931.\n\n157-2-8\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the Department of Indian Affairs at present rents a house and lot at Massett, in the Queen Charlotte Indian Agency, in the Province of British Columbia, as a Teacher's Residence for the Teacher of the Indian Day School at that place. The department has been paying $180.00 per annum for this property, and it is considered in the interests of economy to make purchase.\n\nThe Bishop of Caledonia is prepared to sell this property to the department at a price of $1,087.50, which is considered reasonable by the Architect of the Department. This property may be described as follows:\n\nAll that parcel of land containing one acre and forty-five hundredths of an acre, situate in Lot Thirteen, Queen Charlotte District, Province of British Columbia. The said parcel is shown on plan of survey made by Frank D. Rice, British Columbia Land Surveyor, recorded in the Surveys Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs under number B.C. 600-8.\n\nThe Title to this property has been searched by an agent of the Department of Justice.\n\nIn view of the amount paid for rental as aforesaid it is considered that it would be advisable to purchase the property at the said price of $1,087.50, and the undersigned accordingly has the honour to recommend that authority for such purchase be granted. Funds for this purpose have been provided from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nRe: Proposed purchase of certain land from the Bishop of Caledonia.\n\nYour reference No. 157-2-8.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 9th and to say that communication is going forward to our agent today. Our understanding was that our agent was awaiting the return of the Bishop of Caledonia in order that execution of the deed might be completed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Deputy Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-8, part 1)\nDecember 22, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum to Council, I wish to inform you that there is at Massett a very successful Indian day school. The enrolment last year reached as high as 65 and the average attendance for the December quarter was 48. Two female teachers are employed.\n\nIn September, 1929, it was necessary to secure new quarters for the teachers. In the past they had lived in the agency residence, but as I wished to have them all live on the reserve, other accommodation had to be found for the teachers. The mission house belonging to the Anglican Bishop of Caledonia was available and it was rented at a cost of $180 per annum. His Lordship Bishop Rix believed that the low rental freed the church authorities from making repairs on the property.\n\nI consider it advisable for the Department to have ownership of the building. $180 rental per annum is, I believe, amply worth the property can be purchased for approximately $1,000. Further we can make expenditures on the building, when necessary, without hesitation, when ownership is in the Crown.\n\nI am enclosing a picture of the house in question. It is 36 ft. by 22 ft. and was erected in 1919. It contains a sitting room, a dining room, kitchen, pantry, laundry, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The chimney is brick and there is an open fireplace in the sitting room.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter No. 157-2-8, of Aug. 11th, I was given permission to have a hot water tank installed in the teachers' residence at Massett. On investigation I have found that the outside water tank is too low to give sufficient pressure for a hot water tank inside. It would necessitate raising the outside tank, so I have postponed this work until next year, as it would cost more than I had estimated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nQueen Charlotte AGENCY\n\nTo: J.

These two young teachers live alone and an entrance can be made as easily in the night as in the day. With no agent or constable residing in the village, the matter seems to be somewhat risky. In the event of the new agent living at New Massett, I would strongly suggest that the teachers be permitted to live in the agency house at the reserve, which is more centrally situated, or that older teachers be appointed.\n\nW. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-8, part 2)\nREPORT ON QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1944.\n\nAt the Massett Reserve which I visited about seven times I inspected the painting of the School and building of the new wood shed, also inspected the teachers for repairs to be done during the holidays. I interviewed some of the Councillors at different times, the Chief being away fishing, so that a Council meeting was not held. I also visited several homes and the Cannery which is now canning Salmon. The clam operation this year was not so good, but this was due chiefly to bad weather; however, the last two weeks around 5,000 cases of Salmon have been packed, and the supply of fish is plentiful. The majority of the men folk are out fishing in Area No. 2, and they are expecting a big run of Humps in the Massett Inlet very soon as they have been \"spotted\" outside North Island coming this way.\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nOn my recent visit to the Teachers residence on the Massett Indian Reserve, the condition of the window blinds were brought to my notice, and I wish to report that the majority of them were in a very poor condition and torn, so that I would like to recommend that the following blinds be purchased:\n\n4 only 70\" wide (Cloth measurement) Green\n7 \" 54\" \"\n\nI cannot quote a price on the above, as I don't know whether they are stock sizes, I might add that one inch either way would be alright, as the local stores do not stock above would it be possible to have them sent from Vancouver direct to this Office if this meets with your approval.\n\nS.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Phillips' letter of September 6th, wherein he requests 11 window shades for the teachers' residence at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nThese may be procured in Vancouver at a cost not exceeding $15.00, and I would recommend that authority be granted for purchase of these blinds.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-HN\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n15th instant, the Department approves an\nexpenditure of $15 to purchase window shades\nfor the Massett Day School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFollowing the appointments of Miss L.J. Brunton and Mrs. J. Fray as teachers at the Massett Indian Day School, this office received numerous complaints with respect to the condition of the teacherage, lack of furnishings, water supply etc., culminating in both teachers threatening to resign at Christmas if the conditions complained of were not remedied.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Phillips being absent on holiday leave during September it was not possible to immediately obtain a report on the situation but from information now to hand it would appear that although conditions were somewhat exaggerated, the teachers have some grounds for complaint.\n\nFull details and cost of the requirements have not yet been received, but it would appear from information available that an expenditure of approximately $500.00 will be necessary to secure the furnishings and equipment requested and to carry out urgent repairs.\n\nAlthough this office was not aware of it until now, it would appear that the conditions at the Massett teacherage may have contributed largely to our difficulty in retaining the services of competent teachers at the school and if funds are available, I consider it would be wise to supply whatever furnishings are necessary to make the teachers reasonably comfortable, and to carry out minor essential repairs this year and possibly paint and redecorate the entire building next year if necessary.\n\nP.T.O.\nI have authorized Mr. Phillips to carry out the most urgent repairs and to purchase a few kitchen utensils and dishes in the meantime, and will advise you further on receipt of detailed information concerning all requirements.\n\nFor: D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nNovember 7, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M.

Apparently he considers it unwise to repair the present woodshed and recommends that a new shed be built at an approximate cost of $100.00 for material and labour.\n\nI am inclined to agree with Mr. Phillips and if funds are available would recommend that he be authorized to proceed with the construction of a new woodshed.\n\nFor D.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI wish to submit the following report concerning the teachers at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\n1. School closed on Friday June 20th, in order that Mrs. Conroy and Miss Donnison might reach Victoria in time for the opening of Summer School. The school days June 23-27 had been made up by teaching extra days as shown on the Senior teachers Quarterly Report.\n\n2. Both teachers informed me that it was not their intention to return to Massett next term. They were told to submit their written resignations if they had so decided. Despite their assurances that this would be done, all reports were turned in but no resignations received. I am writing Mrs. Conroy at Victoria requesting such.\n\n3. From reports received, it would appear that the teachers residence had been entered once during the year in their absence and personal property scattered throughout the house.\n\nOn Sunday, June 15th the teachers were awakened at 5 a.m. by a noise seemingly caused by someone prowling near windows. They scared off the intruder and at the same time recognized him. To Mrs. Conroy's surprise it was one of the school boys in her room, Horace Yeltatzie.\n\nThe boy, later in the day, gave no explanation for his actions and his teacher reports him to be one of the quietest of pupils though extremely slow and backward in his work. Inquiries made in the village reveal the fact that the boy is considered \"queer\". He has never been known to take anything or molest anyone, but has a habit of continually prowling around houses at all hours. His mother of course defends him as being innocent of all intent to do mischief.\n\nMembers of the Council, the B.C.Provincial Policeman and I all talked to Horace and it is to be hoped\nthat it had some effect. After careful consideration and by\nrequest of Mrs. Conroy, no further action was taken.\n\n4. On Thursday morning, June 19th I received an urgent\nphone call from Miss Donnison to come to the school. Upon my arr-\nival I was told the following facts.\n\n\"At six o'clock that morning, while sleeping in bed\nMiss Donnison received a terrific blow on the left side of the\nface. Awakening suddenly both she and Mrs. Conroy saw a man's\nfigure leap down the stairs and disappear. It would appear that\nhe broke into the house through the back door, entered the bed-\nroom, delivered the blow and ran escaping by the back door. The\naction happened so quickly and both teachers were in such a daze\nthat they could not identify the intruder. The only description\nthey could give was that he had a brown coat and ran in bare feet.\n\nImmediately I investigated the possibility of the\nprevious intruder having returned (the boy Horace was at school)\nbut there was no evidence of the boy being out of bed at that\ntime of morning on the 19th.\n\nCalling a Council Meeting, and having the B.C.\nProvincial Constable bring in two young men who had been suspected\nof prowling around houses I inquired further.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI wish to submit the following report concerning the teachers at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\n1. School closed on Friday June 20th, in order that Mrs. Conroy and Miss Donnison might reach Victoria in time for the opening of Summer School. The school days June 23-27 had been made up by teaching extra days as shown on the Senior teachers quarterly Report.\n\n2. Both teachers informed me that it was not their intention to return to Massett next term. They were told to submit their written resignations if they had so decided. Despite their assurances that this would be done, all reports were turned in but no resignation received. I am writing Mrs. Conroy at Victoria requesting same.\n\n3. From reports received, it would appear that the teachers residence had been entered once during the year in their absence and personal property scattered throughout the house.\n\nOn Sunday, June 15th the teachers were awakened at 5 a.m. by a noise seemingly caused by someone prowling near windows. They scared off the intruder and at the same time recognized him. To Mrs. Conroy's surprise it was one of the school boys in her room, Horace Feltatzie.\n\nThe boy, later in the day, gave no explanation for his actions and his teacher reports him to one of the quietest of pupils though extremely slow and backward in his work. Inquiries made in the village reveal the fact that the boy is considered \"queer\". He has never been known to take anything or molest anyone, but has a habit of continually prowling around houses at all hours. His mother of course defends him as being innocent of all intent to do mischief.\n\nMembers of the Council, the B.C. Provincial Policeman and I all talked to Horace and it is to be hoped that it had some effect. After careful consideration and by request of Mrs. Conroy no further action was taken.\n\n4. On Thursday morning, June 19th I received an urgent phone call from Miss Donnison to come to the school. Upon my arrival I was told the following facts.\n\nAt six o'clock that morning, while sleeping in bed Miss Donnison received a terrific blow on the left side of the face. Awakening suddenly both she and Mrs. Conroy saw a man's figure leap down the stairs and disappear. It would appear that he broke into the house through the back door, entered the bedroom, delivered the blow and ran escaping by the back door. The action happened so quickly and both teachers were in such a daze that they could not identify the intruder. The only description they could give was that he had a brown coat and ran in bare feet.\nImmediately I investigated the possibility of the previous intruder having returned (the boy Horace was at school) but there was no evidence of the boy being out of bed at that time of morning on the 19th.\n\nCalling a Council Meeting, and having the B.C. Provincial Constable bring in two young men who had been suspected of prowling around houses I inquired further. The two young men established satisfactory alibis and were allowed to go. The Council members are greatly concerned over the affair and when I stressed the seriousness of the situation and pointed out the fact that the reputation of the Massett Reserve was at stake, they took the responsibility or attempting to discover by their own methods the identity of the intruder. They realize too, that such a situation might make it extremely difficult to obtain teachers for their children.\n\nIf it had been the intention of Mrs. Conroy to possibly return for another term, this incident must certainly influence her against doing so.\n\nIt was most unfortunate that such a thing should happen at all, but taking place as it did on the eve of their departure from Massett was a deplorable climax to their term's work.\n\nNeedless to say, they were extremely nervous about nervous about remaining in the residence on Thursday night June 19th and I instructed them to spend that night in the hotel at New Massett. I enclose a voucher covering hotel charges and under the circumstances recommend that it be passed for payment.\n\nInvestigation into the matter is still being carried on, and it is my intention, should the culprit be apprehended to press charges, if necessary.\n\nUpon further developments, if any, a report will be submitted to the Commissioner. When the teachers' resignations are received they shall be forwarded, and in the meantime, advice as to filling the vacancies will be appreciated.\n\n(Signed) J.A.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated\n\nVoucher No. 359\n\nDate: July 27, 1948\nI have to report the following with regard to living accommodation at Masset for three Masset Indian Day School Teachers.\n\n1. The house which was mentioned during our recent conversation is not available. Despite the fact that the owner only uses it occasionally, he will not rent under any circumstances.\n\n2. I have obtained what I consider still better accommodations and which I am certain will prove to be completely satisfactory. Mr. and Mrs. David Hutton, park owners in the local sawmill, have the largest home in the vicinity. Since they are alone in the house, they have, for some time, been considering renting a portion of the building. They have decided to move to the upper floor which is being turned into a self-contained flat and have signified their willingness to rent the lower half of the house.\n\nThis consists of kitchen, combined living-room and dining-room and two bedrooms, one of which is sufficiently large to contain two beds. These rooms are completely furnished. The kitchen has a sawdust burning range, a wood heater in the living-room and a heater in the large bedroom. This space is ample and the house is most comfortable.\n\n3. Mr. Hutton is willing to lease this for a period of ten months starting September 1st, 1946 at a monthly rental of $45.00. This is slightly higher than the figure I quoted for the other house, but in view of the fact that it will include light (electric), fuel, linen and necessary dishes, plus all the comforts of a private home, the rental asked is, in my opinion, very fair.\nShould I have been able to obtain the other house, fuel and light (lamp) would have to be supplied in addition to furnishing dishes, etc., and it is not equipped with any modern conveniences.\n\n4. I consider that we are very fortunate in being able to obtain such accommodation for the next school year, and comfortable living quarters may help in holding teachers here.\n\n5. Mr. Ratten has signed the attached lease and I strongly urge that it be approved and signed by the proper official of the Department. In view of distance and infrequent mail service I am also enclosing a voucher covering payment for rental for four months as per the agreement.\n\n6. Your letter of July 15th, File 11-112 refers to your proposed recommendation that the Department provide transportation for the teachers to and from the Reserve at an approximate cost of $3.00 per day. I have made arrangements with a local taxi driver to provide such service at $2.00 per day. He will call for the teachers at 8:30 A.M. each school day and at a set hour each afternoon for the return trip.\n\nI trust these arrangements are satisfactory and that the lease will be approved. I would appreciate confirmation by wire as soon as you have ascertained the reaction of the Department.\n\nSince there are 180 school days in the 1948-49 scholastic year, the total transportation charges will amount to $378.00. This plus the rental is still less than the amount which would be required to renovate the present residence plus other costs for fuel, etc.\n\nJ. A.

It is not likely that two of the three teachers would be willing to share the one room and bed.\n\nShould it be decided to complete these repairs, the building would still not be in sufficiently good condition to last a period of years. All window frames would have to be torn out and windows replaced. The foundation would have to be renewed and other exterior work done. The amount of money and labor involved is not warranted considering the condition of the building.\n\nShould the Department be able to initiate the possibility of constructing a new residence next year, I would strongly urge that the teachers be accommodated in a house at New Masset for ten months starting September.\nFront Bedroom\n\nThis room was also lined with wallboard but not finished.\n\nMaterials needed:\n\n- 250 lin. ft. wood strip\n- 1 gal. paint\n- 3 pts. casein paint\n- Linoleum 10' x 12'\n- Clothes cupboard\n\nExtra Room Upstairs 6' x 11'\n\nThis small room, too small for an extra bedroom is completely unfinished.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Bldg., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Teachers' Residence, Masset.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is expected that three teachers are to be appointed for Masset Indian Day School for the coming scholastic year, it will be necessary to make provision for accommodations in the residence.\n\nI have made a careful survey of the situation and find that extensive repairs are necessary to place the house in satisfactory condition. It is my opinion that one of the reasons for not being able to hold teachers lies in the fact that in cases such as Masset, the living quarters are actually in a deplorable state.\n\nThe Estimates for the current year included the sum of $5000.00 for new residences at both Skidegate and Masset. A new residence at Skidegate is to be built this summer and if there was any hope of similar action being taken next year at Masset, I would hesitate to recommend the expenditure of money to repair the present residence at this time. By reason for this is that the project would involve considerable expense and in view of the present condition of the building, would actually not be warranted. However, the fact remains that something will have to be done to provide decent accommodation and I am submitting herewith a report based on repairs necessary to each room.\n\nLiving Room:\nThe wall covering (paper) is torn and filthy. The floor covering (linoleum) is also worn although part of this can be put to use in another room. The present heater is worn out and of no use. All window frames are rotten which however would necessitate the tearing apart of the entire window units to repair.\n\nMaterials needed:\n11 sheets wallboard 4' x 10'\nLinoleum 14' x 14'\n2 gal. white paint\nNew circulatory heater.\nAugust 9, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Accommodation Masset Indian Day School teachers\n\nYou will note from Superintendent Findlay's letter of July 9th attached that the condition of the teacher's residence at Masset is such that an expenditure of almost $1000.00 will be necessary to make it habitable, and that as an alternative it is suggested that the Department rent a furnished house in New Masset and provide transportation to and from the Reserve for the teachers.\n\nFollowing Mr. Findlay's letter referred to I had an opportunity of discussing the matter with him and feel that it would be more economical to rent a residence than to repair the existing building which is slated for replacement next year in any case.\n\nMr. Findlay's subsequent letter of July 27th and enclosures referred to therein are attached from which you will note that very suitable accommodation is available at a cost of $45.00 a month and that transportation costs will amount to $378.00 for the academic year, a total of $828.00. The accommodation referred to is fully equipped and will be heated without cost to the Department. I would recommend that the Department approve of this arrangement.\n\nW.S.

A. Foster,\nManager.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources; Ottawa.\n\nRE: Teacherage - Massett Indian Day School.\n\nFollowing Mr. Neary's letter of September 2nd, I communicated with Superintendent Findlay to determine whether or not it would be possible to erect a new teacherage at Massett this year and if so, the size of the building necessary. Mr. Findlay's letter of September 11th in this connection is enclosed, together with a memorandum dated September 16th, from District School Inspector Devey. In view of Inspector Devey's comments, it is felt that we should concern ourselves at the moment with the provision of accommodation sufficient only for our immediate needs and it is apparent that this could be best provided by the purchase and erection of a prefabricated building, Model \"K\", as quoted upon by Prefabricated Structures in their letter of September 24th attached, and as described in the enclosed pamphlet.\n\nMr. Findlay's estimate of the cost of the purchase and erection of a prefabricated building Model \"K\" complete with basement and heating, plumbing and lighting facilities, is $10,000.00 and although it is considered that this amount is rather high, it would, I believe, be advisable to encumber funds to the extent of his estimate.\n\nA review of our files indicates that of our school construction appropriations, we have a balance of $6,000.00 of the amount appropriated for construction at Hazelton, and $7,000.00 of the amount appropriated for construction at Fort Babine. I would recommend that the\nbalance of the appropriation for Fort Babine and $2,000.00\nof the remaining balance of the appropriation for Hazelton,\na total of $10,000.00 be transferred for construction of a\nModel \"K\" prefabricated building at Nassett and that the\norder for the building be placed at an early date as\nconsiderable preliminary work is necessary before construction\ncan be commenced.\n\nI would appreciate being advised as soon as\npossible if my recommendation is approved.\n\nW. S. Arnell\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclo.\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Bldg., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your telegram regarding construction of a teachers residence at Masset and submit the following as a preliminary report.\n\n1. I am in accordance with the proposal of constructing a new teachers residence at Masset as soon as possible but there are several factors which must be considered very carefully.\n\n2. A house similar to that being erected at Skidegate would most definitely not be suitable for Masset.\n\n3. On May 7th, I compiled and submitted a table showing the possible number of school age children during the next several years. These figures would tend to indicate that the Masset School building will have to be enlarged and in due time four or five teachers appointed. Should this develop, there is no reason why Junior High Grades should not be taught. This would most likely mean that a male Principal and three or four other teachers would eventually form the teaching staff at Masset Indian Day School.\n\n4. Although the problem of increased school accommodation can be considered later, the above facts must be considered when a decision is being reached, as to the size of the proposed house. It would be a most regrettable error if the Department insisted on constructing a residence now to accommodate two or three teachers without taking into consideration the question of future requirements as a result of the increasing Indian population at Masset.\n\n5. A three bedroom house would suffice at the present time, if the Department understands that in the event of a larger teaching staff being employed added accommodation would have to be provided.\n\nShould, for instance, in the near future, this school develop into a Junior High, and a male principal, plus three or four teachers...\nbe employed, a small separate cottage could be built to accommodate the principal, whether he be single or married, and the residence proposed now occupied by the remainder of the staff.\n\nI cannot stress this point too strongly, since it is my conviction that it will not be very long before increased school facilities will have to be provided at Masset.\n\n6. Should it be decided to proceed now the following points are important.\n\n(a) Site: The existing residence should be dismantled and the new structure erected on the same site. In this respect I would recommend that the old building be allotted to a Masset Indian for dismantling and removal.\n\n(b) House: Model \"K\" as shown in the Multi-flex booklet, 40' x 28' provides for 3 bedrooms. Model \"H\" is not satisfactory despite having 100 sq. ft. more floor space. This latter model has a hall way which, if all doors are closed, would be in practically complete darkness. In this part of the country, all light possible is needed.\n\n(c) Basement: There should be a full basement. This will mean extra labor in excavation but for reasons of heating, storage space, etc. the basement should be included.\n\n(d) Heating: Furnace, automatic oil burning, should be installed. Oil-burning kitchen range. Fireplace should also be included.\n\n(e) Plumbing: Masset has no water system and it is proposed that a concrete cistern be built in the basement to hold rain water. Inside plumbing to be installed with complete pressure pump system and service tank. Septic tank for drainage.\n\n(f) Lighting: There is no power in Masset Reserve and an 800 Watt A.C. 60 cycle Power Plant should be installed. This will supply light and power for pumping water from cistern to service tank.\n\n(g) Furnishings: The house would need new furnishings, with the exceptions of dinette set and 2 beds which are the only items in good condition. Linoleum and window blinds, etc. will have to be provided.\nIt is obvious that this cannot be built for $5000.00, and a quick estimate of all materials required would indicate a cost of approximately $6500.00, including an allowance for freight charges. I cannot see where the house, as described above can be erected for much less than $10,000.00. I would not like to undertake supervision of the construction unless it was understood that funds up to that amount were available.\n\nThe question arises as to whether the same building could be erected for less by purchasing all frame materials at the local sawmill. Freight charges on this would be saved, but all other items including windows, doors, interior lining, etc., would have to be shipped in. Time would actually be saved by the erection of a pre-fab building since these items are included in the house purchase.\n\nMr. Phillips will undertake the work on a labor contract basis but I cannot furnish any definite estimate of this until a decision is reached by the Department.\n\nShould a decision to build now be definitely reached, I strongly urge that the following points be thoroughly considered.\n\n1. Model \"R\" house.\n2. The problem of future accommodation be kept in mind.\n3. Construction be made on the basis of points (a) - (g).\n4. Funds up to $10,000.00 be available if needed.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nSuperintendent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nFROM: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Masset Day School Teacherage\n\nI refer to Mr. Findlay's letter of September 11th concerning the above. It is noted that Mr. Findlay anticipates a very rapid growth in the enrolment at the above mentioned school and has recommended that provision be made for the construction of a three room block at this school and at the same time keep in mind the possibility of the employment of an additional three teachers.\n\nAt the present time we have some 25 pupils enrolled at the Masset Junior, Senior High School and it seems that the Board is sympathetic to the admission of Indian pupils to their schools. It would therefore seem advisable to secure the Board's reaction to a joint building programme which would enable Indian pupils from the Masset Reserve to be enrolled in the Provincial School in Grades 4 and up. I do not feel that we should consider the expansion of the Masset Indian School to include junior high school grades when these may be enrolled in the Provincial school and I believe that we should approach the Board to see if at a later date we may increase the number of Indian pupils attending the Provincial school.\n\nI might add that in addition to the 25 pupils enrolled at the Masset Provincial School there are 27 pupils enrolled at residential schools. Even if it is possible to secure the admission of grades 4 and above to the Provincial school the number of school age pupils on the Masset Reserve will still warrant the employment of three teachers for grades 1 to 3 inclusive.\n\nR.F.

In order to accommodate the teachers, it was at first proposed that we expend approximately $1,000.00 to renovate the old teachers' residence. Mr. Indian Superintendent Findlay has pointed out that this expenditure would still not put the old building in very livable condition. It is a frame structure and apparently the entire foundation will have to be renewed and other exterior work done. Mr. Indian Commissioner Arneil has, therefore, recommended that funds be transferred as indicated in the attached transfer. Mr. Indian Superintendent Findlay and Mr. Indian Commissioner Arneil agree that we should purchase a Model \"K\" prefabricated house from Prefabricated Structures, Limited. The price quoted on this house is $3,274.00 F.O.B. their plant in Burnaby, B.C.\n\nYou will note that we are transferring sufficient funds to enable us to erect this building complete with basement, heating, plumbing and lighting facilities.\n\nA smaller building was purchased from this same company for the Skidegate Indian Day School in this same agency and has now been erected. It is providing entirely satisfactory accommodation for our two teachers at this point. Therefore, I would recommend that approval be given for the issuance of\na purchase order in the amount of $3,274.00 for the purchase of a model \"K\" prefabricated house from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nActing Director.\nREQUISITION FOR ENCUMBRANCE CERTIFICATE\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\u2014INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nNOT VALID UNLESS SIGNED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\nREQUISITIONS WILL BE NUMBERED IN ONE GENERAL SEQUENCE IN THE ACCOUNTS BRANCH\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: OCTOBER 31, 1948\nACCOUNTS BRANCH\n\nVOTE NO.: 26\nYEAR: 1948-1949\nE.

Under the circumstances and until the prefabricated building which we propose to erect at Masset is ready for occupancy, there would appear to be no alternative but to rent accommodation for the teachers.\n\nMr. Findlay's letter of December 2nd, attached, indicates that Queen Charlotte Agency Voucher No. 359, covering rental of Mr. Rutten's home for four months, has not been paid.

We have not yet issued shipping instructions to Prefabricated Structures as we were waiting for approval of the erection proposal and at this late date it will be impossible to have the building erected prior to March 31st. We can, however, have it shipped immediately and can no doubt provide protection for the prefabricated sections and other materials at Massett until erection is proceeded with.\n\nWill you please advise by Army Signals if it will be in order for us to instruct Prefabricated Structures to ship the building and as soon as possible if the erection proposal is approved.\n\nH.S.

Will you please advise if the proposal for the erection of this building as outlined in my letter of December 30th and Mr. Findlay's letter of December 23rd is approved and if erection may be proceeded with immediately after April 1st.

Phillips as foreman at the rate of $1.50 per hour. However, the expenditure over and above the cost of the prefabricated building will have to be taken from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50. When we prepared our estimates, we were hopeful that this building would be completed before the end of March, and consequently, no funds were provided in the 1949-50 appropriation to complete it.\n\nIt will, therefore, be necessary to transfer the funds from some other proposed building and I would appreciate it if you would advise me from what proposed building in British Columbia you recommend that the amount necessary for Masset be transferred.\n\nBernard F.

Our whole program has been somewhat confused because of the fact that several buildings, construction of which was started last year, are to date uncompleted and we have yet to be advised of the cost of completing them, in addition to which no provision has been made in the Estimates for the erection of the school at Bella Bella.\n\nI am unable at this time to deal completely with the matter in this communication but as far as the Massett teacherage is concerned Mr. Davey is of the opinion that the amount required, over and above the actual cost of the prefabricated building, should be transferred from Alberni. This recommendation is made in the light of information recently received to the effect that a new Provincial school is to be erected at Alberni this year and that there is a reasonably good chance of securing the admission of the day school pupils on the two Alberni reserves. I should like to be advised at the earliest possible date if this transfer is approved as I have telegraphic advice from Supt. Findlay to the effect that Mr. H.B. Phillips has other commitments and if erection of the Massett teacherage is not proceeded with in\nthe very near future he will be unable to undertake the work for us.\n\n-W.S.

This amount covers crating of Gyproc, windows, pre-cut material and sections of the building. Crating of this material was essential to prevent undue damage during the long boat trip to Masset. As a matter of fact, the Steamship Company will not accept materials uncrated for shipment.\n\nI regret that this matter was not brought to your attention when the voucher was submitted.\n\nW.S.

I am inclined to agree with Mr. Findlay that in this case the provision of an oil burner range is preferable because of the high cost of coal at Nasset and the fact that dry wood is almost unobtainable. A suitable range will cost approximately \u00a370.00 and I recommend that I be authorized to make the purchase.\n\nI would also like to be advised if we may purchase articles of furnishings for the new teacherage from the approved list to the extent that are not available from the old teacherage. We have yet to receive a requisition from Mr. Findlay for these furnishings and consequently have no idea what will be required or the cost.\n\nR.F.

In addition to which I would like to recommend that in this case the Department favourably consider the provision of suitable drapes and curtains. This is a fully modern building and you will concede that plastic curtains on the windows of a living room would appear out of place. I would suggest that the Department authorize an expenditure of $50.00 for the purchase of curtains and drapes, the selection of these to be left to the discretion of the teachers under the supervision of Mr. Finley.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n**Pay to:** Delmas Co-op Store\n\n**Address:** Masset, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Aug. 5 | To: Materials supplied for teachers' residence, Masset as per attached account. | 516-13-491 $5.00 |\n\n---\n\n**I HEREBY CERTIFY** that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSeptember 12, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Electric Power, Masset Teacherage\n\nWe have for some time been negotiating with the Department of Transport for the provision of electric power to the new teacherage at Masset, but have to date delayed taking the matter up with you pending approval of that Department. We have now been advised that the arrangement is approved tentatively, subject to the execution of a formal agreement which will provide for the supply of electricity at 10\u00a2 per kilowatt and at the same time relieve the Department of Transport of any obligation to supply power except when the plant is in operation for their own needs. Their plant is presently operating 16 hours a day, which period is ample for the requirements of the teacherage.\n\nThe cost of bringing power from the nearest transformer to the teacherage is estimated at approximately $210.00 for material and labour and I would recommend that an expenditure of this amount be approved.\n\nThe Masset teacherage, you will recall, is a modern building wired for electricity and it is felt that we should take advantage of the available power.\n\nWe are informed by the local office of the Department of Transport that permission to connect to their transformer cannot be given until the formal agreement is drafted, approved and executed, but as this will entail considerable\ndelay and inconvenience to the teachers would it be possible for you to contact the Department of Transport in Ottawa and to secure immediate consent to the connection to their transformer on the understanding that a formal agreement will be entered into at a later date.\n\nW.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil  \nIndian Commissioner for B. C.  \nFederal Bldg.  \nVancouver, B. C.\n\nA credit voucher has been completed and forwarded to the Department, accounting for the expenditure of $3569.09 incurred on labor and cartage charges in connection with the erection of the Masset Teacherage up to the week ending August 27th.\n\nWith the main part of the furnace reaching here on Sept. 3rd at the same time as the arrival of the teachers, it has been necessary for work to be carried on in the basement while the teachers were occupying the Residence. This work has not yet been completed since a further supply of furnace pipes is expected on Saturday next.\n\nAs stated above the accountable advance for labour has been expended as of August 27th. Wages for the weeks ending Sept. 10th and for two days in this week are owing. This totals $145.00. With the remaining furnace work to be done a further $60.00 is required. I would therefore request that an advance of $205.00 be forwarded as soon as possible to cover these labor costs. This will allow the project to be completed.\n\nI may say that the residence is a very fine building and has become the show place of the vicinity. It is to be hoped that with such excellent accommodation and conveniences we may be able to hold teachers for longer than one term.\n\nJ. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6403, File 828-S, part 3)\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDuring the Auditor's recent visit to the Quesen Charlotte Agency office, it was brought to his attention that two accounts with Kurt Lindner General Store were outstanding, and on making enquiries of Mr. Findlay, we learned that these were for materials supplied in September of last year for the Masset Teacher's residence, and further that although Mr. Findlay was aware that certain accounts with this Merchant were outstanding, he did not connect these with the accounts in question for the reason that, as explained in his letter of October 13th with enclosures, attached, he had prepared an explanatory letter and a voucher which apparently, however, never left his office.\n\nMr. Findlay felt that the responsibility in this matter was entirely his and it was not reasonable to expect the Department to pay an account which had been outstanding for over a year, and for which the Department had no knowledge and consequently, he paid it himself. Although we appreciate Mr. Findlay's feelings in the matter, the expenditures covered by his Voucher No. 599 are legitimate charges against the Department and it is felt that Mr. Findlay should be re-imbursed.\n\nI have prepared a Purchase Order covering the two accounts and would recommend payment of the Voucher as submitted.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n-mo\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nFurther to our telephone conversation of yesterday, I am attaching a voucher to cover the two accounts concerned.\n\nAs stated in my previous letter, these items were purchased during the final stages of completing the teachers' residence at Masset Reserve. The items were, in every respect, considered essential and I did not hesitate in purchasing them in order that the house might be completed on time.\n\nWhen the accounts were submitted in October a letter of explanation and a voucher covering the purchases were prepared. The usual procedure is, in cases other than routine vouchers, to prepare a rough draft of letter and voucher which is placed with the work to be completed.\n\nThe fact that the extra copy of the account was filed still does not explain how or why the voucher and letter were mislaid. I can only presume that it went into the waste basket and was destroyed. I realize now that I should have noticed that I did not sign the completed letter or voucher, although with mail being sent out only every two weeks, everything is usually signed at one time.\n\nMr. Lindner mentioned the account some months later, but I did not pay particular attention since he had been agitating for the payment of the old transportation account.\n\nThe matter has worried me and my action in paying the account was taken due to the fact that I feel the responsibility rests entirely with me.\nI appreciate the fact that you feel I should not assume the responsibility for payment, but I believed my action was in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nIt will most certainly be appreciated if the account is passed for payment, but this still does not detract from the fact that I feel the responsibility for the error very keenly.\n\nMay I express my thanks for the consideration shown by you in the matter.\n\nJ.A.

There is also the making of small War Canoes (wood) Paddles, Silver and Gold bracelets made out of Silver and Gold coins, (hand carved), the collecting of spruce roots for Basket making will also have to be considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nR.A. HOEY, ESQ.,\nSupt of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from Acting Indian Agent Phillips in which he refers to Inspector Barry's recommendations regarding vocational training in the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools. Mr. Phillips no doubt refers to the Inspector's reports on the Massett Indian Day School of May 28th, 1936, and May 17th, 1937, and to reports on the Skidegate Indian Day School of May 30, 1936, and May 15, 1937.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools open on October 1st yearly and close on May 31st. The period during which vocational training might best be given in these schools is from November to March, inclusive. The Inspector has recommended that authority be given to Acting Indian Agent Phillips to arrange for instruction in vocational training at Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools at a sum not to exceed $100.00 at each school. Capt. Barry states that 50\u00a2 per week for one lesson each week would be sufficient, and the total sum suggested to cover the salary of the two instructors, Boys' and Girls', at each school would be a little less than $50.00 for each school year. The remaining $50.00 of the sum suggested by the Inspector for each school would be used to cover the cost of the materials required. I concur in the recommendations of Inspector Barry in this connection, and would be glad to be advised if authority may be given to Acting Agent Phillips to make arrangements for such instruction in the two Day Schools of his Agency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M./AC\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Day School dated May 12, 1938.\n\nVocational Training:\n\nA small grant was authorized by the Department to pay for instruction in Basket Making and the carving of Totem Poles in the native slate. A start has been made in the Basket Making but so far it has not been found possible to do much with regard to the carving of Poles.\n\nI should like to see the third classroom, not at present used, fitted up as a Vocational Room. A Circulatory Heater to burn wood and costing about $40.00 would be required, also two large kitchen tables or better two tables made of dressed lumber and with movable trestle supports, and a Singer sewing machine. A few rough forms would also be needed, so that the children might sit at the tables.\n\nI would recommend that the grant for Basket Making and the grant for instruction in the carving of Totem Poles, which in each case covers the cost of materials, and does not exceed a total of $100.00 in all for the school be continued for another year, with the provision that definite results must be forthcoming by May 1939 if the grant is to be continued after that.\n\nI wish also to recommend the expenditure of not more than $15.00 on materials for the Sewing Class which I wish to see started at this school.\n\nThe boys are not old enough for Manual Training at present.\n\nI have asked the teachers to give more attention to Arts and Crafts and Vocational Training at this school, and to take the necessary time from the academic studies. Later I believe that the academic work should only take half the day and the afternoons might well be devoted to Basket Making, Totem Pole Carving, Sewing and Making Dresses etc.\n\nG. H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have to report as follows for the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of November 1938.\n\nThe average attendance for the Massett Indian day school was senior class 38.00 and the Junior class 38.43 at the Skidegate School the averages were Senior Class 19.52 the Junior Class 27.32. I was successful in securing Black Slate for use in the Vocational class for the making of Totem Poles etc. I have not yet secured the services of an Instructor to teach same, but hope to get this going in the near future. Dyes were given to both schools for use in basket making, these classes are proving to be very interesting to the pupils who look forward to the above work.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nI am pleased to report that totem pole carving at the Massett school is in full swing, and on my visits inspected some of the work which is very good indeed. I gave a talk to both classes on the possibilities and future of totem pole carving and basketry, needle work is also being taken up, much interest being shown by the pupils.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nEDUCATION: Both the Massett and Skidegate Schools have been painted inside and outside, new wood shed, toilets, and urinal have been built (or nearly completed) at the Massett School. New wood shed and toilet have been built at the teachers' and new furniture and alterations for the comfort of our teachers. At the Skidegate Reserve a new animal is being built, and also a new fence is being built at the teachers'. There is no doubt that the Indian schools are the best on the Islands; the Indians children of this Agency are very bright, and several are now attending superior schools here, the children are exceptionally good at needle work, drawing, painting and very musical, the parents are very keen on giving their children a good education. We are not equipped for manual training, but have a large class room for this purpose at the Massett school as soon as conditions permit an instructor for that work. Basket making also Slate Totem pole Carving was taught at both schools, but this was stopped at the beginning of the war, several Indian drawings and designs have been entered in a competition at the Stanford University, U.S.A., we have not as yet heard the result of judges, I usually visit the Massett School three times a month and the Skidegate twice a month, Junior Red Cross work is being carried on at both schools. The Massett school has been adopted by the Sir James Barrie Imperial Daughters of the Empire, from which sporting goods etc. have been received for the pupils.\n\nH.E.

Findlay,\nin which he outlines procedure to be followed in providing\nhandicraft instruction to Indian school children in his\nAgency.\n\nI observe that it is suggested that one hour\ntwice a week for instruction should be allowed during the\nschool term, and that the teachers will co-operate\nby rearranging classes to provide for the time.\n\nI agree that it would be an excellent idea to have\nIndian boys trained in slate carving, and the girls in mat\nweaving and basketry.\n\nMr. Findlay seems to have given careful consider-\nation to the plan suggested, and we feel that a sum not\nto exceed $500 could properly be set aside from B.C.\nSpecial Vote, under the heading of Technical Education.\nIf you think this program could be carried on during the\nentire fiscal year 1948-49 (apart from school vacation\nperiods), we will encumber the necessary $500, and you\nwill be in a position to requisition for accountable cheques\nagainst this amount.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you later when you\nthink instruction in silver craft should be given.\n\n(Signed) H.F.

It is apparent now that slate carving is fast becoming a lost art there being only a few older Indians carrying on the work at the present time. The cost of the proposal outlined by Mr. Findlay will not be great and I would recommend that the Department approve payment of $1.50 per hour for two hours a week instruction by one of the slate carvers mentioned by the Agent and that the Department authorize payment of an amount not exceeding $50.00 per annum for the slate material required.\n\nI would also recommend that favourable consideration be given to the Agent's suggestion that some instruction be given the girls in mat weaving and basketry during the period the boys are receiving instruction in slate carving.\n\nI would not recommend, however, that any instruction be given in silver craft work as this would likely conflict with the pupils other craft work and academic training. Consideration might be given to this instruction at a later date.\n\n(Signed) W.S.

Riddoch\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI have received a communication from the Rev. A. Hall, missionary in charge of the station at Alert Bay, requesting me to lay before the Department the necessity of providing a day school at the Ma-ma-le-le-kalla Village, Village Island. Mr. Hall in his letter mentions the fact that there are two other Indian villages in close proximity to Ma-ma-le-le-kalla, and he has hopes that children from both these villages may be induced to attend the Day School.\n\nI find on referring to the last census taken that there are only seven children of school age at the Ma-ma-le-le-kalla Village, nine at the Ta-wak-teek Village, just opposite, and eight at the Kwa-wit-tis Village, which is quite five miles distant, making a total of twenty-four children. Of this number it is not likely that more than twelve would attend as I do not think that any of the children from the Kwa-wit-tis would be able to attend, on account of the distance. The children from the Ta-wak-teek Village at Ta-chi-ma-ka-mi could attend as it is not more than one and one half miles.\n\nA. W. Towell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo forwarding a communication from Mr Agent Pidcock of the Kwakwalth Agency regarding an application made by Rev. A.J.

Vowell forwards a communication from Mr Agent Pidcock of the Kwakelth Agency regarding an application made by Rev. A. J. Hall, Anglican missionary at Alert Bay, for the establishment of a day school at Mamalilikulla. This application, if granted, would entail an expenditure of from $300.00 to $500.00 for a building and $300.00 annually for a teacher's salary. The census shows that there are only 16 children of school age in the neighborhood and it is doubtful whether the attendance would be large enough to justify the establishment of a school, although Mr Supt. Vowell favors it.\n\nAs Mr Agent Pidcock remarks, a suitable teacher might have a good influence on the Indians and this, like all other applications for schools, is made from the missionary's standpoint.\n\nAll these Indians belong to the Church of England.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6403, File 829-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith for your information and consideration a letter dated the 17th instant received from Mr. Agent Pidcock of the Kwawkewlth Agency advertising to a communication recently received by him from the Reverend A. J. Hall, Anglican missionary in charge of the station at Alert Bay, relative to the necessity and desirability of erecting a day school building at the Mamalilikulla village and providing a teacher therefor for the Indian children of that village and those of the Tanakteuk and Klawitsts villages. The Agent remarks that the Klawitsts village being situated five miles distant from that at Mamalilikulla the children of the former settlement could not be expected to attend a day school if erected at Mamalilikulla. The aggregate attendance to be expected at the proposed school would therefore not exceed at present 16 pupils. As the parents of the children of the Mamalilikulla and Tanakteuk villages are anxious to have a day school established in their midst and no doubt would make profitable use of the opportunities placed in their way for the betterment of their offspring I would therefore recommend that the necessary\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6403, File 829-1, part 1)\nnecessary provision be made for the purpose for which application is made, namely, the erection of the building and the payment of the salary of a teacher. In replying to the Agent's letter I stated that I consider half the sum he mentions as sufficient for the erection of a suitable building. There is no reason I can see why the structure should cost more than $300.00 and for the purpose of gaining definite information on this point have asked Mr. Pidcock to request the Reverend A. J. Hall to furnish a plan and detailed specifications showing the cost of each of the different kinds of building material necessary for the proposed work. When this information is received from the Agent the Department shall be again addressed on the subject.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obed. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, P. C.\nOttawa, August 19th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 64 of the 8th instant, in which you inform the Department that the Rev. A. W. Corker has arranged for the incumbency of Miss Kathleen O'Brien and Miss M. Nixon at the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School. The Department has had some correspondence with Mr. Corker in this connection, and it has been agreed to allow this experiment.

Dixon, who has been on the staff of the Alert Bay Girls' Home ever since it opened.\n\nMiss Dixon taught in the Girls' Home for a time and would like to do a little teaching where she is going at Village Island and Rev. A. W. Corker, the missionary in charge for this district, has made out a requisition for a small quantity of school material and I would recommend that the same be granted. I think it better be sent in my care so that I can make sure they get it.\n\nThis is largely a matter of experiment. There has been some past correspondence with regard to opening a school at Village Island which I could not altogether recommend on the ground that the people did not stay there long enough but as these two ladies are going there entirely free of expense to the Department I think it would be wise to grant this requisition and test out to see whether it would advisable to establish a permanent school at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I shall visit the village as often as possible, will be able at the end of the terms to give a report of the work, which will give an idea as to whether the Department should be justified in erecting a school in that place.\n\nThe plan has met the Bishop's approval.\n\nNow the post office is started, I feel something must be done for these newly rising villages. It will be a check to disorder, idleness, drinking, &c., &c., &c., &c. To have two ladies stationed there, & I feel they will do good work.\n\nI am sending through the Indian Agent, a requisition for school material, which I hope you will be good enough to grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.M.S.

But if appointments were made and an inexpensive building were erected, both upon a temporary or trial basis, do you not think the department would be justified in making the experiment? I hope you may come to see, with us, that if we are to lead these people on, now that they are giving up former practices, such efforts will have to be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.,\nVictoria, B.C., Dated February 4, 1924.\n\nThe Indians are away from the reserve a great part of the year, but, if there was a school there, the young men inform me that many of the women and children would remain there. I believe it has so happened in other places.\n\nThe question is would not six months' tuition and discipline be better for the tribe than no tuition and discipline at all.\n\nThen again, the presence of two teachers on the reserve would be a great check to disorders and their influence for good would soon be apparent.\n\nThe Indians want a school, they have promised to help in the erection of the same and they are anxious for improvement, not only their children but themselves.\n\n(Sgd.) A. W. Corker.\nOttawa, Jan. 19, 1924.\n\nDear Bishop Schofield:\n\nI have to refer further to Your Lordship's letter of the 5th instant, relative to the establishment of a day school on the Mamalilikulla Reserve. I wish to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Halliday has reported that although there are enough children to warrant day school activity, the Indians reside in the village only half of each year. He believes that the Indians of the two bands which are close to the village would soon tire of sending their children regularly to the school and that the only regular attendants would be the Mamalilikulla children. Our agent states that the Indians on this reserve have been asking for a school for several years, but he has not recommended their request because they do not remain at the village throughout the year. In closing he states that \"I would not like to give any guarantee that the school would be kept in operation regularly more than five months out of the twelve.\"\n\nI am sure Your Lordship will understand that I hesitate to establish a day school at this point, without better assurance of a worthwhile activity. If you have any more light on the question, I shall be pleased to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. Chas. D. Schofield, D.D.,\nBishop of British Columbia,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, Jan. 19, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 94 of the 8th instant, reporting on the advisability of day school activity on the Mamalilikulla Reserve. In reply I have to inform you that the Department is corresponding with the Bishop of British Columbia, and, after a decision has been reached, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 23rd with regard to a request from the Lord Bishop of Columbia that a Day School be established on the Kamikamika Reserve.\n\nI have to advise you that I have gone into this matter with the Indians of the Kamikamika Band and I find that there are fourteen children under six and twenty children between six and fifteen years of age. Of these children a number are at present attending the Fort Bay Industrial School. There are enough children belonging to the Band to warrant a school being started.\n\nHowever I think it is only fair that I should let you see both sides of the situation. The Indians of the Kamikamika Band have a good village site, good buildings, but during probably seven months of the year the majority of them are wandering about in different places engaged in various occupations and it is not probable that there would be a very good attendance at school during those months when they are busy at their various occupations. It was brought to my attention that the Indians of the Taraktenk Band, who live about a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half away, and the Indians of the Kwautele and Matilai Band, who live about three miles away, would send their children by boat to school every day and take them away again after school was over. I am too well acquainted with the Indians to believe that this would last more than a few days at the beginning and an odd day afterwards so that no dependance could be placed on the attendance of any children from these other villages.\nThe Kamakillikalla Indians have been asking for a school for several years past and it is on account of the fact that they do not remain steadily at the Village that I have not recommended it to the Department years ago. It might be worth the experiment but I would not like to give any guarantee that the school would be kept in operation regularly more than about five months out of the twelve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

I am pleased to inform you, in reply, that your request will be given favourable consideration, and, as soon as I have corresponded with our local representatives, I shall have further information for Your Lordship.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. Chas. D. Schofield, D.D.,\nBishop of British Columbia,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nIndian Dept., Ottawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nYou will perhaps recall that when you were in Victoria during the summer, I had an interview with you in Mr. Betchburn's office regarding a Field Matron or Teacher for the Indians settled in and around Village Island, and the parts east and north of Alert Bay.\n\nI have been discussing this matter with our Mr. Corker-missionary at Alert Bay\u2014who knows the situation better than any one. He is of the opinion that there are numbers of children within reach of Village Island who will never be sent to the Boarding School, and who nevertheless require instruction and care. He feels also that unless there is some one at an out-lying point like Village Island the good work done at Alert Bay can never really tell because so many of the boys and girls fall back again for lack of friendly sympathy and support, soon after returning to conditions of the old life.\n\nIn view of these facts I have approached our lady workers at Alert Bay. These ladies have felt all that I have written for some years; and they have been longing for an opportunity both to help the children who will not come to the boarding schools, and to conserve the fruits of the hard work done in those schools.\n\nTo this end I am in a position to state that Miss Nixon\u2014a member of our present staff at the Girls' Home, Alert Bay, and for many years our Teacher there\u2014is ready to offer her services as Teacher of a day school at Village Island; and that Miss O'Brien, who has been working for me among the Indians at Alert Bay for upwards of two years in social work, would be ready to accompany Miss Nixon as Field Matron.\n\nIn Miss Nixon's case, a salary would have to be provided; but Miss O'Brien would be ready to go for a nominal salary of say, $30 to $40 per month.\n\nThe suggestion I would venture to offer is that...\nWherever the school-house might be built, living accommodation should be provided for the ladies, perhaps overhead. Mr. Porter tells me that if the department would go ahead with the plan, the Indians on Village Island, who are very keen to secure a school\u2014there are some 20 children there at present\u2014have promised to help with the building without charge.\n\nI may add that I have had a talk with Mr. Mitchburn about this matter, and he states that he believes it is the right way of dealing with the situation, and that he will support the details as I have set them forth herein.\n\nWhile I am sorry to take away Miss Nixon and Miss O'Brien from Alert Bay\u2014where they have both done excellent work\u2014yet I am fully persuaded now that this suggestion of establishing an outpost is so vital to the whole work, and that only experienced workers among Indians will do, that I am ready to make the sacrifice, if the department listen to our combined judgement in the matter. We can more easily find workers for Alert Bay than for Village Island.\n\nCommending the whole enterprise to your favourable consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nyours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nOn February the 21st, I visited a Settlement of Indians located on Village Island. This Island is about 15 miles from Alert Bay, B.C. I made this trip with Mr. Agent Halliday.\n\nIn September last a Mission for the help of these people was opened by Miss Nixon who has been connected with the Alert Bay Girls' School over ten years, and Miss O'Brien who has been Field-Matron without salary in the village of Alert Bay for four or five years.\n\nThe expense with this work so far has been paid by these ladies. In fact, when they called at my Office last August, they said they were not going to ask the Department for help at the present time.\n\nMiss Nixon is carrying on the school and has enrolled 19 pupils of school age. This is a very isolated spot. It will need two workers, and I am sure that if one of the present workers had to leave the other would not remain.\n\nIt would be well, I think, to let the school go on as it has been going for the past six months. By that time, June the 30th, it will be known whether a new school is to be erected at Alert Bay or not.\nThe best thing that can be done with these children is to enrol them in a Residential School. The Agent is sympathetic and has provided some requisites for the school.\n\nThese ladies carry on religious services on Sunday. They teach the children to sing, and they are trying to inculcate the great principles of the Bible. The children are responsive to a marked degree.\n\nI may say that I was delighted to find the Village so clean and tidy. These Christian workers are reaching the parents through the children. A few of the children of this Village have attended the Residential Schools at Alert Bay.\n\nI will keep in touch with this movement through the Agent, Mr. Halliday.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nR.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, March 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting on the activity at the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School, on Village Island near Alert Bay.

I have recently returned from a visit to Village I. The way in which these ladies have won the hearts of the children and indeed the adults as well, is quite astonishing. Their brave self-sacrifice is unquestionably the secret of their success.\n\nWhile it may be too early to erect a schoolhouse, I hope it may be possible for the Dept. to improve the condition of the existing building, and to provide some desks and chairs, as the ladies are having a most difficult time as things are.\n\nI hope too it may be possible for you to make some grant to these ladies: Miss O'Brien as Matron/nurse (I think this was the term you used) and Miss Nixon as teacher. At present Miss O'Brien is paying all charges out of her own pocket, except for a tiny grant I have been able to secure from one of our church organizations.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Village is small for the services of two paid workers. There are nineteen pupils of School age enrolled. With this number of pupils the school work will justify the expenditure of the money necessary to make the school efficient.\n\nMy recommendation, therefore, would be that as there is no assurance that the Alert Bay plant will be enlarged in the near future, provision should be made at once to carry on educational work on this Reserve.\nThen regarding the employment of a Field-Matron, I do not know whether there is an urgent need for a worker of this kind or not. With the Hospital at Alert Bay to deal with serious cases, I have doubt as to the need of such a worker.

(RG. 10, Volume 6403, File 829-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, estimating the cost of providing a classroom and social hall for the Namlililikulla Indians of Village Island. I note that the local missionary will arrange for the transportation of the materials from Alert Bay and that another Rev. Gentleman will build the fireplace and flue, without cost to the Department. I note, further, that the materials and the wages of a foreman will amount to approximately $1375.00 and that the two lady workers at Namlililikulla will contribute a total of $400.\n\nI regret that the Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned and that I cannot authorize you to proceed with the erection of this building at the present time. I will note the item for our next Estimates and, when funds are available, will have another communication for you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6403, File 829-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 64 of the 15th instant, urging the Department to provide a school building and hall for the Mamalilikulla Band. I note that the Indians wish certain funds of theirs used to assist and will give their labour gratis. Before the Department can give intelligent consideration to this request, it will be necessary to have an estimate of the total cost. Please give this your early attention and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nThe Department will doubtless remember that considerable correspondence has taken place regarding the institution of a school on Village Island Reserve for the benefit of the Indians of the Mamalilikulla Band and adjoining tribes. It has been more or less of an experiment but the attendance at the school has been so good and the success has been so great that I feel justified in asking the Department to consider building a school house on the Reserve for that purpose.\n\nYesterday two of the Chiefs of the Mamalilikulla Band called to see me and they had a proposition to submit which I think is worthy of consideration. There is in the hands of the Department between $190.00 and $200.00 of money credited to that band for trespass of timber. They told me that at this meeting they had decided unanimously to ask the Department to use that money and to donate sufficient more money to buy material for the erection of a substantial school building 40 feet long and 26 feet wide, the building to be used as a school house and social hall as well as for church services. They also ask that a carpenter be sent to oversee the work and to help in the building and they themselves will supply the labor providing the material is on the ground at such times as they are there at home to do the work.\n\nThey leave for the fishing some time about the middle of May and are away more or less continually until the middle of November so that during these months they would not be able to render any assistance in the building of the school.\n\nThey seem very desirous of having the work carried on and the Indians themselves are very pleased with the results but there are so many children\nattending that the building they have at present will not hold them all and they come in relays to school.\n\nI would recommend that this assistance be given subject to the proviso that the building should be under the control of the Department for school purposes and could only be used for other things with the consent of the teacher who might be in charge at the time otherwise there would be a tendency to use it for feasting and other purposes which might be inimical to the work.\n\nIt is so seldom that the Indians themselves are so enthusiastic over the education of their children that I think under the circumstances it would be a pity to disappoint them.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. W. Halliday\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting on the Mamalilikulla Day School experiment. I am informing His Lordship the Bishop of Columbia that no salary can be allowed at the present time but that the Indian agent will be instructed to make repairs to the school and supply what equipment is considered necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, August 12, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Schofield:\n\nWith further reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 16th ultimo, relative to the Mamallilikulla Day School experiment, I have now to inform you that reports have been received from both Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Indian Agent Halliday. I regret that a salary for the two lady workers cannot be allowed at the present time; but I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, asking him to make a recommendation concerning what repairs should be made to the building used as a classroom and as to what furniture or other equipment is required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Chas. D. Schofield, D.D.,\nBishop of British Columbia,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July the 23rd enclosing a copy of a letter to Mr. Inspector Cairns regarding a salary in the case of the two lady workers at the Mamillikulla Reserve.\n\nI have some hesitation regarding making any specific recommendation regarding this school. In the first place the two ladies who are there, Miss Nixon and Miss O'Brien have been purely honorary workers. Miss Nixon formerly taught at the Alert Bay Girls' Home and while one does not want to speak disparagingly it must be confessed that the work there was altogether too strenuous for her owing to her years. She has been inspired at all times with a strong missionary spirit and has always had the ambition to go to some of the villages where some of the girls she formerly taught were living and settle down for a quiet easy existence. Miss O'Brien has an independent income the extent of which she wisely keeps to herself. I have heard it suggested that Miss O'Brien is likely to leave this field in about a year and return to England for the rest of her days but the work that she has been doing has been very efficient. She has cared for the sick and tried to show the women how to keep house and has been a great asset to the mission field.\n\nUp to the present time she has received no remuneration of any kind with the exception that some of the lady missionary movements have given a certain amount of furniture etc for her work.\n\nAccording to the census taken in 1922 the total population of the Mamillikulla Band was 79 of which 24 were under sixteen years of age and since that time there is very little change in their numbers, so that\nthis may be taken to be approximately correct. Heretofore\nthe Indians have only been at this village from about\nthe first of November until the first of April although\none or two families stay there for longer terms than this.\nIf these ladies should give up the work it might be a long\ntime before any other honorary missionary would come and\ntake it over and if the Department carries on the work\nit would mean a great expense for the number of the\npopulation involved. I certainly should recommend that\nevery assistance be given in the way of books and the\nrental of a building suitable for a school but as the rest\nof it is to a certain extent still in the experimental\nstage I think it would be as well to give them a little\nlonger trial.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 4, 1926.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\n\nI wonder if it would be possible at any rate for you to secure the appointment of Miss Dibben as Field Matron at Alert Bay, the same to date from September 1st, 1926.\n\nI am sure Miss Dibben would be content with a salary, at all events at the beginning, of $60.00 a month.\n\nUp to the present I have been able to secure the payment of Miss Dibben's salary from sympathetic friends. She has now undoubtedly proved her worth, and as I am finding it very difficult to secure the money at the present time, she would be immensely grateful if your Department could take her over from the first of September. Would you be good enough to let me know at the earliest possible moment if you can consider such a matter favourably.\n\nRegarding Miss O'Brien as Field Matron and Miss Nixon as Teacher at Village Island.\n\nWhile the matter is not so pressing, since these ladies are willing to labour on almost without remuneration at present, yet I hope from what you said when you were here that it might be possible also to give them at least a small income; for the present I am persuaded that Miss O'Brien would be quite happy with $50.00 a month and Miss Nixon, with $60.00, if you could possible arrange for these sums.\n\nI hope you will not think that I am pressing too earnestly for these appointments, but you see I have been carrying the burden for several years and I think now these good ladies ought to have proved their worth to your own, and the Department's, satisfaction.\n\nTrusting you and Mrs. Scott had a pleasant journey across the continent, and with all good wishes,\n\nI remain,\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. You will notice there are the ladies' names, which Mr. Steele, the Indian Agent, has written on this page. I thought surely like he wrote last winter when he did the C.C.M., and like a year ago they were with him at the C.C.M., and he wrote his name on the list. You wrote his name on the list, and you would always mention something each appointment; and you do spring from this source.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6403, File 829-1, part 1)\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMy dear Dr. Scott:\n\nI should have acknowledged long ago your kind letter of August 13th, together with the copy of the letter you sent to Dr. Westgate of the same date, but I have been almost continuously away from home in outlying parts of the Diocese since that time.\n\nBesides this I knew you understood my outlook in regard to the new school and I felt it was really rather unnecessary to write again.\n\nAlthough I have heard nothing since from your Department - I have heard from Dr. Westgate that our Commission are prepared to leave the responsibility of choosing the site entirely in your hands - I hope by this time that a start has been made upon the new school.\n\nYou will have learned, of course, that the present school is crowded out this term, and a huge waiting list of Indian boys has been created. If we can seize the situation without further delay I am persuaded that really great possibilities lie ahead of these schools at Alert Bay.\n\nBut I really set out to write this letter on behalf of our lady helpers, Miss Dibben, Miss O'Brien and Miss Nixon.\n\nYou will remember that when you were present in Victoria I wrote a letter to Mr. Ditchburn, under date of August 7th, a copy of which was handed to you, dealing with this matter.\nFebruary 16, 1929.\n\nI visited the following schools on the above date:\n\nVILLAGE ISLAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school is in charge of Miss M. B. Nixon, who is doing splendid work, and the pupils are responding to the efforts of the teacher.\n\nThe building was erected through the joint efforts of the M.S.C.C. and the Diocesan Board of Missions, Victoria, B.C. The school takes children in from the villages of New Vancouver, Nimoumies and Harbledown, and one or two smaller centres.\n\nThe children are not very regular in attendance until nearly Christmas time, when they steady down for two or three months, after which the attendance drops off again, due to the parents' departure to get ready for fishing. The attendance on Wednesday, February 13th, was 25, mostly primaries. Good health and religious teaching is carried on by the teacher and her companion Miss O'Brien.\n\nMiss Nixon has had 17 years' experience in Indian Schools. Miss K. J. O'Brien is the Field Matron.\n\nThe village is kept clean and sanitary. This condition is due to the work and energy of Miss O'Brien.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:\n\nThe work done in these schools has been under the supervision of the Anglican Church in co-operation with the Indian Department. This work is greatly appreciated by the Department of Indian Affairs, as these children are receiving religious training from the Columbian Mission.\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, December 21, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that you have secured the services of Miss Eva I. Dyer, a qualified teacher, for the Indian Day School at Kingsome Inlet also that Miss M. Simon will continue the work at Namalilikulla. It is hoped that both these ladies will meet with every success at their respective schools.\n\nIt is noted that arrangements have not yet been completed for a teacher at Fort Rupert but that, likely, Miss Cadwallader will take up teaching duties at this school. We note that she has no professional qualifications but has an intimate knowledge of the Indians at this point and has also the ability to speak their language. Her services will, no doubt, prove satisfactory.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed definitely as to whether Miss Cadwallader takes charge at Fort Rupert and, if so, the date when this school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Maclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nRoom 605,\n100 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, November 14, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to your request when in Ottawa yesterday, I am pleased to inform you that on the 12th ultimo the Department wrote to His Lordship the Bishop of British Columbia, in part as follows:-\n\n\"The activity at Village Island (Mamalilikulla) is, apparently, past the experimental stage, and I have directed that a salary of $75 per teaching month be paid to Miss M. Nixon. Your Lordship will please arrange to have her send quarterly reports to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday.

Nixon, teacher at Village Island (Namallil-likulla) salary of $75 per teaching month for the period this school is in operation during the present school year. This activity is apparently past the experimental stage, and the work being performed warrants the Department in paying a salary to the teacher. No stipend will be paid to Miss O'Brien, the field matron, as it would be necessary to establish the position. The salary as mentioned above is for the activity generally at Village Island.\n\nPlease supply Miss Nixon with the necessary forms for the making out of her quarterly returns, which she should prepare at the end of each quarter and forward to the Department through your office, when the salary due her at the above rate will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am giving consideration to the establishment of a field matron's position at this point and I shall write further concerning Miss Dibben.\n\nThe activity at Village Island (Mamalilikulla) is, apparently, past the experimental stage, and I have directed that a salary of $75 per teaching month be paid to Miss M. Nixon. Your Lordship will please arrange to have her send quarterly reports to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday. No stipend will be paid to Miss O'Brien, the field matron, as it would be necessary to establish the position. Accordingly, Miss Nixon is being allowed a larger grant than Your Lordship requested.

She said she taught school in a kindergarten for about six months in England, but other than that has had no experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

It is noted that the school was only open for one month during the quarter and salary is being allowed for that period. Cheque is being issued in favour of Miss Phyllis Yeoman and will be sent to you.\n\nPlease get in touch with Rev. John Antle, Room 605, 198 Hastings Street W., Vancouver, B.

Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMay 20, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Schofield:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 18th instant, informing the Department of the retirement of Miss Marion E. Nixon as teacher of the Nasalililikulla (Village Island) Indian Day School in September, next, and recommending the services of Miss Yeomans to succeed Miss Nixon.\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, who recently visited this school, states that the work will not be success until there is a trained teacher in charge. The Inspector further stated that he was much opposed to the appointment of Miss Yeomans, as she has no certificate or training and would not, in his opinion, prove an efficient teacher. He strongly recommended that the services of a fully qualified teacher be obtained, and I should be pleased if Your Lordship would give this matter further consideration.\n\nThe Department has recently written to Rev. John Antle, Superintendent, Columbia Coast Mission, regarding the retirement of Miss Nixon and the appointment of a qualified teacher, as Mr. Antle had been interested in the work at this point. The Department may have been in error in writing him in connection with this matter. Upon your further consideration of the question of a teacher to take Miss Nixon's place this autumn, I shall be pleased to have your nomination of a qualified teacher.\n\nYour Lordship will be written a separate communication regarding the appointment of a successor to Miss Diben, who is retiring from her post at Alert Bay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. Chas. D. Schofield, D.D.,\nBishop of British Columbia,\nBishop's Room, Memorial Hall,\n912 Vancouver St., Victoria, B.C.\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Doctor:\n\nI have had word from Miss Nixon, your teacher at Village Island, that her health is probably going to demand her retiring from that post in September of this present year.\n\nAs you know, I think, this effort of Miss Nixon's has been much appreciated by the Indians at Village Island and, on the whole, I am persuaded that she has made some real progress with the younger children there.\n\nI trust, therefore, that there will be no question in your mind but that we should continue the good work. During this Winter Miss Nixon, facing the possibility of the action outlined above, has had living with her, and sharing in the work, a Miss Yeomans.\n\nFrom what I can gather Miss Yeomans is promising very well as a teacher and is apparently deeply interested in the welfare of the Indians.\n\nI am anxious, therefore, to know if you would let me nominate Miss Yeomans to take Miss Nixon's place this Autumn, if the latter finds that she, as she anticipates, must give up.\n\nAgain, at Alert Bay Miss Dibben is considering the possibility of retiring from her post. Nothing is settled as yet, but very naturally I am anxious to secure your mind in regard to this position as well.\n\nI am sure Miss Dibben's work has been well worthwhile and if you are willing I should be glad to put myself to the task of trying to find a successor. This time it might be possible to find someone who has been even better trained than Miss Dibben in modern Social Service work, although, of course, the salary that you are able to pay will hardly be big enough for a fully trained worker. Perhaps,\nDr. Duncan C. Scott.\n\nMay 12, 1931.\n\nIn any case, we hardly need such a person for this Indian work. You will realize, I know, how important it will be to get someone who is sympathetic with our work at the Bay which holds so large an interest among the Indians.\n\nI shall be glad if you would be good enough to let me know as soon as possible about this question so I may get to work without delay.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nOttawa, May 18, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School, states that the work being performed by Miss Marion E. Nixon, the present teacher, is not very satisfactory. He also states that this school will not be a success until there is a trained teacher in charge, and that Miss Nixon informed him that she was resigning at the end of the school year. The Inspector further states that he was informed Miss Phyllis Yeoman, who acts at present as assistant teacher, would be recommended to succeed Miss Nixon.\n\nThe Inspector stated that he was much opposed to the appointment of Miss Yeoman, as she has no certificate or training, and would not, in his opinion, prove an efficient teacher. He strongly recommends that the services of a fully qualified teacher be obtained for this school, and I should be pleased if you would give this matter your consideration and nominate a qualified teacher for the next school year. Please forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent, Columbia Coatt Mission,\nRoom 603 - 195 Hastings St. W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Report of Gerald H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Victoria, B.C., dated April 15th, 1931, on his inspection of the MAMALILLIKULLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 156-13-6.\n\nTeacher:- Miss Marion E. Nixon.\n\nNot very successful. The children who answered best had been previously at Alert Bay Residential School for about a year.\n\nThis school will not be a success till there is a trained teacher in charge. Miss Nixon informs me that she is resigning her position at the end of the present school year. I understand that Miss Phyllis Yeoman, who acts at present as an assistant teacher, will be recommended for the vacant post. I am very much opposed to the appointment of Miss Yeoman, as this lady has no certificate or training, and would not in my opinion prove an efficient teacher.\n\n4 desks that should be at this school are at Fort Rupert. No other equipment has been supplied to this school. Teacher wishes to have paper towels and paper handkerchiefs for the school.\n\nThere is one building used as a schoolroom. This belongs to the Anglican Church, and was built in 1927 for a school. It is about 28 ft. by 22 ft.\n\nThere is one blackboard about 36 ft. by 4 ft.\n\nHealth:- The children had bad colds during the month of February.\n\nLength of Session:- School is in session from 10 a.m. to 12 and from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nMethods of Instruction:- No professional methods are used. I did my best to show the teachers how to teach certain key subjects, by giving Demonstration Lessons in Number Work and Reading. I described how Reading and Number Charts could be constructed and used.\n\nControl:- The control of the class was very weak.\n\nCourse of Study:- I provided the teacher with the latest Course of Study.\n\nThe teachers consider that many of the children at this school are sub-normal. This is not so. The reason that the teachers think this is that they fail to get the proper response from the children, due in my opinion to the lack of ability to present a lesson.\n\nStanding of School:- The standing of this school is not very satisfactory. A trained teacher is necessary here.\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nMany thanks for your letter of May 20th.\n\nI have noted carefully what you say regarding Miss Yeomans and the Inspector's report upon the school at Village Island. In many ways I heartily agree that we will never get the best results from a school like this until we have a qualified teacher. But from what I know of the place personally, and from what Miss Nixon tells me, it is a grave question if, in the first place, a qualified teacher could possibly be satisfied with the conditions that prevail in such a school; and secondly, whether she herself could get into touch with these children. I imagine Mr. Barry himself is so new at this work that he hardly appreciates the tremendous difficulties attached to it.\n\nIn other words, the one who teaches these children has to be prepared to go down into the village and do all kinds of work among the parents and children themselves out of school hours. It is because Miss Nixon and her honorary companion, Miss O'Brien, have given themselves wholly to these people that they have been able to make a start with this school at all.\n\nHowever, I am just starting off to visit Village Island again myself and I shall go into the situation very thoroughly, and upon my return talk it over with Mr. Antle and between us we will let you know what we finally think about the situation.\n\nOne further consideration before I pass from Village Island. If is doubtful if a teacher could live upon the present salary. In Miss Nixon's case her companion has paid a good many of the expenses.\nWhile at Alert Bay I shall also have an opportunity of studying afresh the conditions surrounding the post which Miss Dibben has been occupying, and so be ready to write when I receive the communication you refer to from the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. His health is in the best state and will probably fail soon. Perhaps he will take some interest in his work here and may be of use yet together with his wife here.\nSir:\n\nThe Department has just received Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Mamalilli-kulla Indian Day School on May 6th, last. As you are aware, there is a trained teacher, holding a First Class B.C. Certificate, at this school, but the Inspector states that satisfactory progress is not being made, owing to the irregular attendance.\n\nThe Department desires that you watch the attendance at this school during the academic year 1933-34, and you should inform the parents that, if the attendance is not more regular in future, the Department will be obliged to consider closing the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of the 24th ultimo, regarding the appointment of Miss Patricia Grimmond as teacher of the Mamallilikulla (Village Island) Indian Day School. His Lordship Bishop Schofield now informs the Department that Miss Grimmond has decided that she cannot accept the position, and he nominates Miss Dora White, 101 Henry St., Victoria West, B.C., for the position. He states that he consulted Mr. Inspector Barry and that he approves of the appointment of Miss White.\n\nThe Department is informing His Lordship that approval is granted for the appointment of Miss White for the coming school year, to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. I have to request that you will give her every assistance you can in her work at this school, where it is hoped she will meet with success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, August 11, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Schofield:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that Miss Patricia Grimmond, who was appointed teacher of the Mamalilikulla (Village Island) Indian Day School for the coming school year, has now decided that she cannot accept the position.

Mackenzie, Esq.\nSec. Dept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Mackenzie,\n\nI regret to have to report that Miss P. Grimmond, whose appointment to the Indian School at Village is your letter of last week confirmed has now decided that she must accept a white school elsewhere in B.C., which she has been offered.\n\nIt is only fair to say that Miss Grimmond's parents are probably responsible for this change of front; but I have expressed to her and them my disappointment at her action. On the other hand, we all felt here that it would never do to insist upon her fulfilling her promise against her will.\n\nIn the circumstances therefore I have been in touch with the Inspector and we have decided to recommend another of those who applied in the first instance.\n\nWe accordingly hereby formally nominate for appointment as teacher at Village Island school, Miss Dora White of 401 Henry St., Victoria West.\n\nWhile Miss White did not take as high standing in her Normal School work as did Miss Grimmond, she has excellent credentials and the Commissioner Capt. Barry and I are agreed that she should do first rate work among the Indian children.\n\nIn this case I have Miss White's assurance that she will go to the school if given the appointment.\n\nI hope it may be possible for you to let me have both the cancellation of Miss Grimmond's and the confirmation of Miss White's appointment so that I may place the matter all in order before I leave for the East later in this month.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is informing His Lordship of the approval for the appointment of Miss Grimmond, to begin duties on or about September 1st, next.

I may say that we all three have found a complete basis of agreement regarding our nomination to your Department.\n\nWhen I talked over thoroughly with the Commissioner and Captain Berry, I found that they understood my former difficulties and heartily agreed that, in order to make the school a success, we had to secure not only a really good teacher, but one who would also be interested in the Indians in themselves.\n\nOn this ground we are agreed that I should nominate to you for appointment to the School at Village Island, Miss Patricia Grimmond, 1637 Oak Bay Avenue, Victoria.\n\nMiss Grimmond has high recommendations both as to character and teaching ability, from the educational authorities; and I am persuaded that she will be ready to give her best services to the building up of the Indian School if the Department will confirm this appointment.\n\nTrusting that this will all be in order and that you will be able to make the appointment without delay,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6403, File 829-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 13, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Schofield:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant, relative to teaching services for the Mamalilikulla (Village Island) Indian Day School for the coming school year.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is noted that you have discussed this matter with both Mr. Inspector Barry and Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and that it has been decided to obtain the services of a Church of England qualified teacher and that the nomination will be forwarded to the Department in the near future. It is hoped that the services of a satisfactory teacher will be obtained in time to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, and we will await Your Lordship's nomination, which will have favourable consideration.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication regarding the appointment of a field matron to succeed Miss Dibben.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRt. Rev. Chas. D. Schofield, D.D.,\nBishop of British Columbia,\nBishop's Room,\nMemorial Hall,\n912 Vancouver St.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nA. E. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Supt-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nAs promised in my note to you some weeks ago, I called at Village Island, while on my visit to Alert Bay, and went carefully into the matter of school affairs there.\n\nSince my return I have talked the whole subject through with both Inspector Barry and Commissioner Ditchburn.\n\nInspector Barry has convinced me that the possibility of Miss Yeoman qualifying for teaching work is rather small, and I think I am prepared now to withdraw my advocacy of her appointment.\n\nThe Commissioner, the Inspector and I have decided that we all ought to work together in this matter and secure a Church of England qualified teacher who will also be interested from the missionary point of view. I am not without hope, therefore, that we may be able to secure someone who will satisfy us all and fulfill the several points we are desirous of securing in this teacher. I trust it will not be long before we shall be ready to submit the name of a successor to Miss Nixon as teacher at Village Island.\n\nAnother matter that we have been discussing together and which I understand Indian Agent Halliday has already written to you about is the question of a successor for Miss Dibben (as Miss Helen at Hur Bay).\n\nWe are all agreed that since we are making this change, while Miss Dibben was as faithful and devoted a worker as could be found, we should try to secure these characteristics combined with a greater knowledge of nursing and better training in this art.\nThe suggestion which I find we are all in favour of is that we should combine the nurse at the Industrial School with the Field Matron in the Village, if this meets with the Department's approval; and if we can also secure the consent of our own Church of England Commission dealing with these matters at Winnipeg.\n\nThere are many considerations which commend this procedure. I think I should place first the growing sympathy that it ought to produce between the Village and the School. Then, the combining of the positions will enable us to pay a better salary without demanding more from either the Department or the Church Commission. Again, the dual position would mean a greater challenge to the right kind of nurse, and she would also have the companionship at meals, and other times, of a larger body of persons all interested together in this Indian work.\n\nI am writing at this time commending the matter to our own Commission and I hope your Department also will find it possible to agree in this method of filling the position.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you again,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSeptember 28, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated September 20 re the above.\n\nYour instructions in regard to the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School will be fully carried out. Under present arrangements, this Day School will not re-open until the 1st of November next owing to the Mamalilikulla Indians still being engaged in their fishing activities, there being no children in the village and the people very much scattered.\n\nI would state that during last winter there was much dissention amongst the Indians of this village and this apparently had its effect on school attendance. I made frequent visits there and found it necessary on several occasions to warn the parents to take other action in connection with the lack of support given the teacher of the Day School. This routine will be continued after November 1st and if there are no indications of improvement within the first month, a further report will be rendered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.M. Mewham\n(E.G. Mewham)\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe Village Island School seems satisfactory under the present arrangement, and I gather from Capt. Barry, School Inspector, good progress is being made, but unfortunately owing to the pot-lach activities in this particular portion of the Agency during the past winter, the attendance has not been as good as desired. However, a separate report has been made on this problem, and it is hoped with the plans we have in mind, that the Department will do all in their power to help solve this difficulty. The school at Village Island I understand is owned by the Church, but the Department are expected to pay for the running expenses and upkeep. I am under the opinion all day school buildings where we have the school definitely established should be taken over by the Department, and the title vested in the Crown as these buildings are all located on reserves. I am also of the opinion in the best interests of all concerned, our schools and arrangements for the education of Indian children should be slowly segregated so that the responsibility will eventually rest entirely with the Department. I understand the salary cheques of certain teachers in our schools come through the Columbia Coast Mission which would mean the teachers come more or less under their jurisdiction. I am merely drawing this to the Department's attention, realizing the fact at times when this arrangement exists certain pressure is brought upon the Department to undertake work which in our opinion is not practical or necessary. For this reason I feel if all the day schools were controlled entirely by the Department and arrangements made through this office, more efficiency would be the outcome and the administration less confusing.\nThe Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will have learned from the Indian Agent at Alert Bay that Miss Iona P. White has resigned as teacher of the day school at Village Island, and that he has accepted the resignation.\n\nIn a letter received from Mr. Todd he has asked me to nominate, in the usual way to your office, a successor to Miss White.\n\nI am writing at once to forward the nomination of Miss Hughina Bowden, 2512 Wark Street, Victoria, age 22, Health - good.\n\nMiss Bowden is a graduate of the Victoria Normal School, 1930-31, with second class interim B.C. certificate, which I am assured will be gladly renewed by the Department. She also holds a Physical Training certificate.\n\nWhile Miss Bowden has not as yet actually taught in her own school she has taken the full nursing course at the Jubilee Hospital in Victoria since her normal School course was finished - she has kept in touch with her teaching through Sunday School classes and Anglican Young People's Association.\n\nIf her appointment is accepted by your Department she is prepared to leave her present position and take a Summer School course at the Normal School in Victoria, and I am assured by the educational authorities that this should make her thoroughly fitted and ready to take on the work at Village Island.\n\nI know Miss Bowden well and believe she would bring to her work not only sufficient educational facilities, but a very real willingness to serve our Indian children in every way possible.\n\nI am further persuaded that she would be the right person for this post, since she is a fully trained nurse as well as teacher. One of the difficulties at Village Island has been to keep the children in good enough health to be regular\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nJune 24, 1935.\n\nat the school, and I am of the opinion that a person like Miss Bowden could anticipate such ailments as colds, etc., and help the children very much in this way.\n\nAs the Summer School meets on July 8th, and Miss Bowden would not care to lose her present post unless she is assured of this appointment, may I ask if you would be good enough to wire me your confirmation of this nomination at the earliest possible moment. I shall be glad to see that Miss Bowden fills out any necessary application forms after I hear from the Department.\n\nTrusting this will all commend itself to you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Columbia.\n\nP. S. I should be grateful for word regarding the new school at the Indian village in Quatsino Sound. Just as soon as I hear from the Department I shall be glad to make a nomination in this case also.\nSir,\n\nUnder date of June 24th His Lordship Bishop Schofield of the Diocese of British Columbia, in a letter written to the Department, copy of which he forwarded this office for our information, recommended to the Department the appointment of Miss Bowden of 2312 Mark Street, Victoria, B.C., to succeed Miss Dora P. White as teacher of the Indian Day School at Village Island.\n\nI have carefully perused His Lordship's letter, and do not altogether agree with some of the remarks he has made therein, in which he says, \"One of the difficulties of Village Island has been to keep the children in good enough health to be regular at the school.\" Personally, I do not feel this is fair to the late Matron, Miss K.J. O'Brien, M.B.E., even though Miss O'Brien was not a fully qualified nurse; nevertheless her care of the Indian children at Village Island has been remarkable and very satisfactory indeed. Our difficulty in having the children attend this school regularly is through the fact quite a number of the families go trapping in the winter time as well as being late returning from the fishing grounds, together with potlatch activities which affect the school attendance.\n\nIt is also noted in His Lordship's recommendation of Miss Bowden that she is a graduate of the Victoria Normal School with a second-class interim certificate which he states he is sure will be gladly rendered by the Department. His Lordship also mentions Miss Bowden is a fully qualified nurse, and that she is at present employed on the permanent staff of the Jubilee Hospital at Victoria, B.C. We feel with so many teachers carrying first-class certificates out of employment in British Columbia, it is hardly fair to appoint one who is now employed in the nursing profession to a position as teacher of this school where the term has always been somewhat short.\n\nHowever as it has been the Department's policy to be guided more or less by the Bishop's nomination, I do not wish to interfere as I realize it is a very type of person who will fit into this particular location. This nomination has been discussed with Mr. Phalen who only very recently visited this Agency, and it was decided to leave the matter entirely with the Department. I feel, however, it would be better in the future if nominations were forwarded through this office in order that we will be kept in touch with the progress being made in regard to appointments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Had Captain Barry seen fit to visit the Indian Office during his recent inspection and asked for any information which he was not sure of, it would have been made available to him. It is true he was hurrying to catch a boat after his work was through but he had over two hours at his disposal during which he could have come to the Office rather than phone me from the Residential School and tell me that \"everything was fine\".\n\nI trust the Department will correct these errors in Captain Barry's report as arrangements were made for the children referred to be admitted to the Residential School some two months before Captain Barry made his inspection, and we would like to have their records clear on admittance.\n\nCaptain Barry further states on Page 1 that I have prohibited the teacher from using corporal punishment. This is not according to facts; the teacher spoke to me of having some difficulty in controlling the children in school and I informed her it was the policy of the Department not to use corporal punishment but that it might be necessary in extreme cases as a last resort.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nReplying to Departmental letter No. 156-13-1 dated December 8th last in connection with the appointment of Miss Marjoria Bird as teacher of the Mamallilikulla Indian Day School, I beg to advise the Village Island School usually opens some time in November as the Indians do not return from the canneries before the beginning of November and it has been the practice to start this school as soon as they return.\n\nMiss Bird's salary will commence from the date school opened, November 1st, as will be shown on the quarterly return soon to be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Todd in connection with Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Mamalilikulla Day School on April 5. On page 3 of his report Inspector Barry states that the father of the Monday children is unknown. Mr. Todd advises that the father of these children is known and is properly registered in the Indian Agent's office at Alert Bay.\n\nSome two months before Captain Barry's inspection the Indian Agent corresponded with the Department with a view to placing these children in a Residential School.\n\nOn page 1 of Inspector Barry's report he states that the teacher informed him that the Indian Agent had prohibited her from using corporal punishment. Mr. Todd advises that this is not according to fact. The teacher spoke to him of having some difficulty in controlling the children in the school and he informed her it was the policy of the Department not to use corporal punishment but that it might be necessary in extreme cases as a last resort. Mr. Todd's advice to the teacher in this regard is in accordance with Departmental policy.\n\nWhile Inspector Barry apparently does not consider it advisable to erect a teacher's residence at Quatsino it appears from the information received from Indian Agent Todd that such action might be advisable in view of the fact that it would enable us to engage a married teacher and, if the proper persons were secured for the position, it would be in the best interests of the band.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\nI am informed that the present teacher has found it very difficult travelling from Quatsino White Village to the Reserve each day to her school on account of the rough water in that particular place. Part of the time at least the teacher has resided in a tent about half a mile from the school.\n\nIf you have occasion to visit Quatsino I would appreciate if you would look into the matter and decide what action would be best to take under the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

I have been informed by the department that the following teachers are to report for duty at the beginning of the new term in this agency; Miss D. Flick is to take charge of the second classroom at the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and Miss C.

He was further requested to communicate with Miss Bird, the present teacher, in order that we might learn if she was prepared to continue under the changed conditions.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Mr. Todd's reply, from which it may be gathered that Miss Bird is willing to be teacher of the Namalilikulla Indian Day School from January 1st to May 31st, 1941, unless her services are required by the Government in some other capacity.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

If anything unforeseen occurs, such as the Government requiring my services after the general registration, I will let you know at once.\"\n\nIt would therefore appear at present that we may count on Miss Bird's services at this school from January 1st to May 31st, 1941.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Vancouver, B.C.\n\nVillage Island Day School - This school has been closed for some time owing to our inability to obtain a teacher. The Indians of this village are most anxious that the school be reopened if at all possible, and as I have previously informed the Department, Miss Flora Hanuse has been carrying on this year without any remuneration from the Department. As stated previously, I will make a further report and definite recommendation at a later date as to whether I consider she should be employed or not for next term.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KNAKWEWLTH AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nEducation -\n\nWhile at Village Island I was informed that an Indian girl by the name of Flora Hanuse, ex-pupil of the residential school, is holding school at the request of the Indian people of that village. This action was taken entirely on their own, with no permission or obligation on the part of the Department. I found the school clean, and the children interested in attending, and as the Department have been unable to provide a teacher for this school, no objection was raised in any way.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KWAKWELTH INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH JANUARY, 1944.\n\nEducation:\n\nMajor V.Z. Manning, Inspector of Schools, inspected the following schools during the month: St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay Indian Day School (both junior and senior rooms), and Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School, where he found the school closed on account of no Indians being present in the village. He also informed me that he visited the Village Island School where a temporary school is being carried on part time by Mrs. Lucy, who is stationed there by the Anglican Synod of B.C.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nFeb. 5th, 1944.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of January 27th last file #215-6-9952, I beg to advise you the question of opening the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School has been under consideration since last mid-summer.\n\nIn your letter of August 28th last, file No. 215-6-6462, you stated the department felt that unless the number of children available to attend is much larger than during the last quarter the school was in operation, it is doubtful if it would be advisable to re-open this school.\n\nIn view of this I immediately undertook a survey to find out how many pupils would be available to attend school and sought the co-operation and help of Miss K.J. O'Brien, M.B.E. We had three different conferences over this matter and as we were unable to find sufficient children, reporting the matter to you was delayed hoping that something might change the situation whereby sufficient children could be found and the school opened.\n\nIn the meantime Miss Hanuse, now Mrs. David Dawson, got married, and when I approached her again about teaching school she informed me that she did not think she cared to.\n\nRecently Mrs. Lucy, who was Matron in charge of the Preventorium at Alert Bay, has moved to Village Island to make her home with Miss O'Brien and I understand that in order to find something to do she has undertaken to teach the four (4) or five (5) children who are in the village. A few days ago another family returned which will now make the attendance eight (8), I am given to understand, but this is all that will be attending so far as I can learn.\n\nI do not know what Mrs. Lucy's qualifications are as a teacher, but presume it would be better than having the school closed. If the department felt they could afford to open the school for eight (8) pupils and if Mrs. Lucy's services would be satisfactory and she would give us an undertaking to hold school regularly and that her work as teacher would come first before village nurse, I would be in favor of having her appointed to this school for the balance of the term; which could not be longer than May 31st, as the Indians will be leaving at that time.\nThe whole situation is very unsatisfactory and it is regretted that the one or two families who live there with children are deprived of an opportunity to educate their children through other Indians choosing to live elsewhere rather than at home.\n\n\"M.

That letter was written subsequent to the receipt of your letter of February 11, 1944, with which you enclosed a copy of a communication received from Indian Agent Todd, and at that time you stated you were not in a position to recommend the re-opening of the school.\n\nIt is felt that unless the number of children of school age has increased considerably from the number mentioned in Mr. Todd's letter of February 5, 1944, the Department would not be justified in operating a school at this point.\n\nHowever, you are in the best position to decide the matter, and if you consider it advisable to have Inspector Manning visit Village Island and submit a report, you may do so. You might let me know, later, what action you have decided to take.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nJune 12th, 1945.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.

C., which was carried on by Mrs. Beatrice Hanuse, registered Indian lady of the Mamalilikulla Band, at the request of Miss K. J. O'Brien, M.B.E., in order to assist the children who were temporarily living in the village with their parents at that time. I might state the fathers were working in a logging camp on the Reserve and that is the reason why the families moved to Village Island.\n\nMrs. Hanuse is an Alert Bay high school graduate, and while she has no certificate, did the best she could, and I think the Department would be justified in giving her some remuneration for her efforts. She undertook this work at the request of the Indian families and Miss O'Brien, the Department providing the school supplies.\n\nThe school was open sixty-nine days during the Winter and I would like to see the Department compensate her to the extent of $100.00. I discussed the matter with Inspector Manning and he informed me that Mrs. Hanuse did very well and felt she should be compensated for her work.\n\nWould you please refer this matter to Ottawa with your recommendation, and advise me in due course.\n\n(M.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: Mamalilikulla Indian Day School and Teacherage\n\nI have tried every conceivable means of finding a way in which Mamalilikulla Indian Day School can be opened for academic term 1949-50 with the amount of funds approved by the Department for repairs to temporary building for teacherage, and I find it impossible. The funds provided are not sufficient to repair the proposed building in order to make it livable in an isolated location such as Village Island. There are no conveniences of any kind, no plumbing or water in the building, and people are going to insist on having a bath once in a while. Should the Department approve of sufficient expenditure there is no one available now to make all these repairs in order to get the school opened at the beginning of the term.\n\nThe confusion has arisen through the fact that School Inspector Davey, yourself and the writer did not examine the Bell home carefully when visiting the village. At that time we could not get a key to get into the building; otherwise, we would have known that it would have taken considerable money to complete the construction, and therefore in all probability would not have entertained the renting of that building. As you know I consulted Henry Bell immediately after to ascertain whether he would rent the building to the Department for a teacherage, with the understanding that he would finish the construction of the building, install plumbing and have the building ready for occupancy at the beginning of the school term. When I checked up ten days ago to find out how the work was progressing he informed me that he had not commenced the work and that he did not now have time and refused to give us any cooperation.\n\nIt was at this stage I immediately went to Village Island to find out if there was any other building that could be used as a teacherage, and my long distance 'phone call to School Inspector Davey was the result of this trip.\n\np.t.o.\nI have now come to the opinion that it is useless for us to try and open this school this year when we cannot find a proper place to accommodate the teacher. I am, therefore, recommending that this school not be opened this year due to circumstances beyond our control. At the present time school supplies have been ordered and no doubt are in transit. These are being shipped in-care-of this office and will be received and put in storage here until the new school is built. We have also submitted a requisition for a new oil-burning heater for this school. As it has not been ordered by this office would you please cancel this requisition dated July 9th, 1949.\n\nWe have no further commitments other than the Department has forwarded this office an accountable cheque in the amount of $105.00, which was to be used for rent for the building we originally proposed to rent from Mr. Henry Bell. This money will be returned to Ottawa once the decision is concurred in by your office and School Inspector Davey not to open the school this term.\n\nI regret having to inform you that I cannot find it possible to open this school for the reasons given above, as I was most anxious to have this school opened; particularly when School Inspector Davey was able to obtain the services of a teacher whose Mother would be able to accompany him to this isolated place.\n\nReviewing this particular school situation a little further, it now seems to me we have two alternatives: We should consider the erecting of the new school and teacherage at an early date so that any funds spent in connection with this school will be of a permanent nature, or the Department be prepared to spend sufficient funds (approximately $400.00 in addition to the $200.00 for the purchase of the building) on the Church building which would make it livable until we could get the new school and teacherage built. If the Department wished, some of the necessary funds could be used from the Welfare Vote, as the building will be given to an Indian when no longer required by the Department.\n\nIf some plan along this line could be worked out, it is possible the school might be opened later this fall when we are able to obtain help to have the necessary repairs completed to the building.\n\n(M.

Mr. Halliday was written on the 9th instant and requested to state when Miss White reached the village in order that the Department will be in a position to decide for what period salary can be allowed her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I would like to make a few comments on the remarks of Miss White re her reasons for the school being closed.\n\nMiss White spent her Christmas holidays at Alert Bay and the weather was so bad it was not possible for her to return to her school in time. This was known to me at the time and in order to get her back when she did, it was necessary that I send the Departmental boat to Village Island for this purpose. I would like to refer also to the date of March 19th when Miss White states most of the village were at Alert Bay where some of the people were confirmed. This is quite true, as His Lordship Bishop Schofield was at Alert Bay and practically all the children of Village Island were here being confirmed by him, and I presume Miss White did not think it necessary to hold school with one or two children only.\n\nI trust this explains the matter fully to the Department and that they will forward her cheque without any undue delay.\n\nI am also enclosing a Requisition for School Material which I would recommend be forwarded her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Bowden, teacher of the Mamalilikulla Village Island Day School, for the months of November and December.\n\nMiss Bowden has informed me she feels the cheque should have been for $180.00 instead of $177.00.\n\nI have looked up her quarterly returns, and find that the school started on the 1st of November and that she has taught two full months, and believe the cheque should have been for the full amount and no deductions made. I did note, however, that Miss Bowden when filling in her quarterly returns, stated that school opened on the 2nd. This was technically correct, but as the 1st came on a Sunday I do not feel any deductions should have been made as she taught the full month of school days and was on duty previous to this. Possibly there is some other reason why the deduction was made that we are not aware of, but I am inclined to feel it was through her stating on the report that school started on the 2nd instead of the 1st.\n\nWould you kindly check this up and if found correct, issue a further cheque in the amount of $3.00 in her favour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant regarding the amount paid Miss Hughina Bowden as teacher of the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School for the months of November and December, 1936, the return stated quite definitely, as mentioned in your letter, that this school re-opened on November 2nd. As these returns are subject to review by the Auditor General, it is only possible to allow her salary from the date of the re-opening, viz., November 2nd.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief Training Division.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nUnder date of February 13th last I wrote the Department explaining Miss Hughima Bowden, teacher of the Namalilikulla Indian Day School, had made an error in her last quarterly return by stating the school reopened on November 2nd instead of on November 1st, and that a deduction of $3.00 had been made from her November salary cheque on that account.\n\nToday I am in receipt of Departmental letter No. 156-13-3 dated Ottawa February 19th, in which the Department states as follows:- \"As these returns are subject to review by the Auditor General, it is only possible to allow her salary from the date of the re-opening, viz., November 2nd.\"\n\nI can understand the Department making the deduction when the school return stated November 2nd, but as Miss Bowden had reported for duty previous to November 1st and November 1st being a Sunday and therefore not a teaching day, and further, that she held school during every school day of the month of November, I cannot see how any deduction can possibly be made when she is paid by the month.\n\nI am therefore asking the Department to review Miss Bowden's claim and to forward her a cheque in the amount of $3.00 which she has rightly coming to her. I am quite satisfied unless the Department do this considerable correspondence will follow, which I do not wish to see take place.\n\nFor the information of the Auditor General, a copy of my letter of explanation should be sufficient to clear up the difficulty, and I am herewith enclosing a copy for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 1st, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nUnder date of February 13th last I wrote the Department explaining Miss Hughina Bowden, teacher of the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School, had made an error in her last quarterly return by stating the school reopened on November 2nd instead of on November 1st, and that a deduction of $3.00 had been made from her November salary cheque on that account.\n\nToday I am in receipt of Departmental letter No. 156-13-3 dated Ottawa February 19th, in which the Department states as follows: \"As these returns are subject to review by the Auditor General, it is only possible to allow her salary from the date of the re-opening, viz., November 2nd.\"\n\nI can understand the Department making the deduction when the school return stated November 2nd, but as Miss Bowden had reported for duty previous to November 1st and November 1st being a Sunday and therefore not a teaching day, and further, that she held school during every school day of the month of November, I cannot see how any deduction can possibly be made when she is paid by the month.\n\nI am therefore asking the Department to review Miss Bowden's claim and to forward her a cheque in the amount of $3.00 which she has rightly coming to her.

While it is true the first day of the month was a Sunday, at the same time I would point out that, in paying her for twenty-nine (29) days, we strictly followed regulations. As a matter of fact, payment would be made in this manner for any other Government official, even though he was employed at a monthly rate. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to allow Miss Bowden the $3.00 which she claims.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan.\nChief, Training Division.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nYour letter No. 156-13-3 in connection with the claim of Miss Hughima Bowden, teacher of the Mamalilikulla Indian Day School for the balance of her November salary in the amount of Three Dollars which was deducted from her cheque owing to an error she made in stating she commenced duties on November 2nd rather than on November 1st, and pointing out the Department is strictly following regulations in this regard, has been received.\n\nWhile I agree with you that possibly the strict interpretation of the regulations has been carried out through the fact that she stated she duties commenced on the 2nd rather than the 1st through an error, nevertheless the Department's refusal to recognize Miss Bowden's apparent claim is making it rather awkward for myself and might appear to the Church as hardly good enough under the circumstances should they take the matter up.\n\nWhile I do not wish to refer to the matter any further over such a small amount as three dollars, I cannot help but feel that we are making a mistake in not satisfying this claim. It is my desire to have the goodwill and full co-operation from all employees of this Agency and all matters of this kind often work themselves out harmoniously in the long run, and as stated in my previous letter, I do not wish this to lead into unnecessary correspondence, nevertheless I am afraid unless the Department can see their way clear to pay Miss Bowden this amount she will take the matter up with the Church which I did not wish to happen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Miss Hughina Bowden | MANALILLIKULLA | $900.00                | $270.00    |                                     |\n\nTRIPPLICATE FOR FILE\nVoucher (in Duplicate) attached for Accountant to pay.\n\nVote 169\nSch.

If the whole job cannot be completed we should be able to have materials delivered to site before the end of March so that if necessary work could proceed when it is possible to put labour under canvas.

(RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\nExtract from Report of W.S. Simpson, Indian Agent, Skeetches Agency, for the month of March, 1912. Original on File 35640-58.\n\nLiard Post.\n\nI met quite a number of the Liard Indians and found them well provided and prosperous, all or most of them had made a fair fur catch and they were also anxious to see a school in that vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. W.S. Simpson.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 27, 1912.\n\nEXD.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report for the month of March last, in which you state that the Laird Post Indians are anxious to have a school at this point I beg to say that the Department does not consider that any action should be taken in this matter at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nFort St James, B.C.\nDecember 9th, 1933\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nI am herewith sending you the McDames' School Requisition List for next summer. I hope it will not be found to be too heavy.\n\nAfter much waiting I got a letter from the Ex-Ministry of Lands in Victoria stating that I could have a parcel of land at Liard Post, one acre, as a lease, $5.00 a year for 29 years. The Bishop thinks it is not worth it, so I am hereby asking the Indian Department through your Office the permission to erect a log building on the Indian Reserve at Liard Post, at a place near Watson's Cabin, as soon as conditions will allow.\n\nWe had a foot of snow around the 15th of October but it all melted away soon after, then it rained like the flood. The roads and even the C.W.R. line were in an awfull shape up to a week ago. On the other hand the weather has been easy on the wood pile. But it looks as if we were in for the winter now. Hoping it is not too hard on you.\n\nWith kind personal regards for the coming season,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nTwo Subjects:\nMcDames Creek. School Supplies.\nLiard Post. establishment of Mission Building.\n\nE. Allard & Co., M.I.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, herewith, a letter received from the Rev. Father E. Allard, C.M.I., who is and has been in charge of all R.C. Mission work in this part of the Stikine Agency.\n\nHe has already established a Church in the Townsite of Telegraph Creek, which is his Headquarters. He has constructed a small log Cabin, which is used as a Church, on the Dease Lake Reserve, at Dease Lake, which is 150Km on route to the Interior. At Mc Dames Creek, the centre of the Cassiar District, he has established quite a large Church combined as a R.C. Mission School also. Last summer he brought up with him Father Bosie, a very fine personage, as his assistant, and who went on foot to the Caribou Hide district - 250 miles south east of this point.\n\nFather E. Allard now wishes permission to erect a small Church building combined with a school house on one of the five Indian Reserves already laid out, at Liard Post B.C.\n\nEnclosed is submitted a very rough sketch of the ground and buildings around the Liard Post, but it will at least show the location of the proposed R.C. Mission building.\n\nLast Fall the Rev. Father mentioned that he was having logs cut for this purpose, but would later ask permission to locate and build. It is understood now that the logs are being cut on the back of one of these Reserves.\n\nHe also asked if the Department would object to the few half-breed youngsters of that district being allowed to attend the School, after it got under operation.\n\nFather Allard is doing very good work in the Interior, but his efforts in and around the Town of Telegraph Creek does not seem to have any lasting effect, and is non-existent in the winter months. In other words, R.C. Missions seem to be more suited for wild interior districts.\n\nTherefore, as the Anglican Mission does not bother about matters outside the district of Telegraph Creek, it is sincerely thought that permission should be granted to the R.C. Authorities to construct a Mission at Liard post Reserve, which would serve for the attendance of about 25 Indian children at the present time.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., Aug. 31st, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder a report covering the month of July 1934.\n\nOn the reserve and somewhat back from the R.C. Church but on a good dry level sandy bench, has been constructed a very fine and large Log Building, with a good upper floor space. It is intended to be used as a school, and so remove the present school work outside the Church Building. Great credit must be given the Rev. Father E. Allard who has consistently pushed this work forward.\n\nThe youngsters were examined and found to have made good progress, they were dressed better than has been noticed ere this, and their copy books were neat and tidy. Much good drawing was seen, whilst the elder ones could read and write, sufficient to use an Eaton's catalogue. However the work so caused is more than one man can do, however good his intentions are, and it is sincerely and kindly thought that Father Allard is trying to do too much.\n\nIf it were possible for him to obtain a teacher for the summer months, and so turn that part of his Mission over to his helper, he would then be free to give more attention to the sadly wanted sanitary conditions all over the reserve. These Indians are nomads, and move from one district to another, mostly when their camps become so dirty that even they stay there no longer, so it will be seen that during the summer stay at the Post their camp sites get to be disgusting. If this matter could be arranged the McDames Band would benefit greatly, it is really more important than the attention given to the youngsters attending the Mission school.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.,\nJune 17th, 1936.\n\nSTIKINE INDIAN AGENCY REPORT FOR MONTH OF MAY 1936.\n\nWhilst in Prince Rupert His Lordship Bishop Bunoz was called upon. His general idea of matters regarding the R. C. Mission work in the south end of the Stikine Agency, is that they should concentrate their efforts more on the Cassiar proper, the nomads of the Inside, and that the Mission work at McDames Creek should go forward as much as possible, and as some of the Halfbreed Families of Liard Post have requested His Lordship to open up a school of some sort at that point, this also should go forward to the fullest extent.\n\nH. Reed\nIndian Agent.\nLiard Post\n\nA number of Indians are around this Hudson Bay Co. Post for considerable periods. There are also a number of white and half breed families resident in the near vicinity. These people are anxious to erect a school and get some education for their children. A joint Indian and white school has been suggested. When this matter materializes you will doubtless hear from Indian Agent Reed.\n\nG.S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nCOPY.\n\nStikine.\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nFebruary 16th,\n1937.\n\nYour Reverence,\n\nIt is wished to thank you for your kind letter dated January 16th, wherein is mentioned the fact that a R.C. Mission Church and School is proposed for Mard Post.\n\nThere are no doubt as many if not more half-breeds at this point, than there are Indian Children. The Parents of the Halfbreeds have stated their willingness to help construct and maintain a school for their children and, as you know, they are quite capable of doing so. Fuel here is most abundant, and prices paid are high.\n\nOwing to the state of lawlessness prevailing at this point Father Boss\u00e9 last summer thought it was hopeless to try and do anything until such matters receive proper attention. This was reported and will no doubt receive attention in the near future, it is hoped. Therefore a Grant for a Teachers Salary was not included in the Estimates. It will be rather difficult to obtain that for this year, but an effort will be made.\n\nIt is understood that your Church and School will be situated on your own property, obtained by the late Rev. Father Allard O.M.I., which is most centrally located, and near Anderson's Trading Post.\n\nHowever it is most apparent that a school should be opened at this point, especially as the abundance of fuel has now drawn Indian families that way, and therefore the matter shall be submitted to The Department. Also when there, this summer, a special inspection shall be given this matter.\n\nHis Lordship.\n\nBISHOP BUNOZ, O.M.I.\n\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nBISHOP'S HOUSE.\n\nPRINCE RUPERT. B.C.,\nCANADA.\n\nJan.16. 1937.\n\nMr Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Reed,\n\nI heartily thank you for your good wishes and most cordially reciprocate them all. May God bless you and grant you a very happy and prosperous year.\n\nI am much pleased with the contents of your letter and may inform you that it is my intention to build next Summer a chapel and school at Liard Post. It seems to me that a school is even more necessary at Liard Post than at Mc Dames on account of the halfbreeds. I hope the Indian Department will provide a salary for a teacher.\n\nI have also a letter from Father Bosse' saying that he is quite satisfied with his work at Iskut (Klappan Day School). It is gratifying to hear him say that he is hopeful for even greater and better results in the future.\n\nWith kind personal regards.\n\nI am. Yours very truly.\n\nSigned. X.R.M. BUNZ. O.M.I.\n\nIndian Office Note:\n\nAbove letter referred to was in connection with Klappan Day School - reporting on same, and requesting the name of the School Teacher for Mc Dames Mission Summer Day School for the coming summer. They have established well at Mc James Creek, with much help from the Department, and should by all means keep this mission point going.\n\nH.R.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nFebruary 18th,\n1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit a copy of a letter received from His Lordship, Bishop Bunoz, C.M.I., in connection with his intention of creating an established Mission at Liard Post B.C., away in the interior.\n\nReports on this matter have been rendered to the Department in past times, especially when Father Allard (since drowned) was in charge of Mission Affairs here.\n\nLast fall Father Rosse', now in charge, returned from Liard Post and stated he could do nothing down there until some law & order was established. Therefore the matter was not further advanced.\n\nAbout 15 to 20 Indian children might be able to attend if a school were started, but to do this it will take a full summer season to bring the school into shape.\n\nIt is most respectfully mentioned that perhaps if some arrangement could be brought about whereby the Teacher could be paid for teaching Indian children at so much per head per day, with a small allowance for books and some equipment, it might possibly keep expenses down to reason.\n\nThere is no doubt but what the parents of the Halfbreeds should get together and maintain a school at this point, and if so, such help as the Department can allowed would be to their advantage.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 20th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing copies of correspondence received in connection with the establishment of a day school at Liard Post, B. C.\n\nIt is noted that, in the event of a school being started, it would be attended by both white and half-breed children as well as Indian. As the education of half-breeds and white children is a duty of the Provincial Government, no doubt an effort will be made to have them contribute part of the cost of the operation of this school. In that event, you might advise the Department, stating what proportion of the cost the Provincial Government will pay and we will then decide what we can allow for the education of the Indian children who would attend the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nBISHOP'S HOUSE.\n\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C. APRIL 28TH, 1937\n\nCANADA.\n\nMr Harper Reed, Indian Agent\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Reed,\n\nI wish to announce you that Father A. Drean and Mr James Anglin will leave here for the North on the 16th of May prox. The former is going to Liard Post where he will spend the whole summer, the latter is destined to Mc Dames where he will take charge of the Summer School. I hope he'll arrive to his post about the first of June. I trust that his salary will be $110-00 per month. Mr Anglin has more experience than his predecessors; he is an ex-soldier of the British Army in India, and has quite an education. He looks upon his future teaching at Mc Dames as a work of love. He should give a good account of himself.\n\nFr. Drean goes to Liard Post to build a church and a school. I would be very thankful if you could help him with tools and perhaps supplies to feed his helpers, of course Indians.\n\nI wish to make one more visit to Liard Post, as I want to see that mission well established. So I may have the pleasure to meet you this summer.\n\nWith best wishes. I am.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned - X.E. M. Bunoz O.M.I.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE NOTE.

Indian Agent.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your telegram of the 15th instant, with reference to the proposed erection of a day school at Liard Post.\n\nWhile the reports that we have received indicate that there are several Indian children requiring education at this point, at the same time we are advised that there are White children and half-breeds who wish to take advantage of a school. As you are aware, this Department is not responsible for the education of either White children or half-breeds and, as there will likely be a greater number of these than Indian children, it was felt that we should not consider any contribution until we are aware what the Provincial authorities are prepared to do. They are responsible for the education of White children and half-breeds.\n\nIn any case, I regret that it will not be possible to make any allowance for this school during the current fiscal year. Our funds are so limited that we cannot consider expenditures for which funds have not been specifically provided.\n\nNo doubt, within the next few months, we will receive information regarding the total number of White and half-breeds who would attend this school, also the total number of Indian children, as well as the amount that the Provincial authorities are prepared to contribute. When we have this information, we will be in a position to decide what sum this Department can allow and, if possible, provide the necessary money in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

It was uncertain as to if such could be started this summer, in spite of the fact that His Lordship Bishop Bunoz's wishes tended that way.\n\nRev Father Bosse has just been interviewed on this subject, and he states that he has written to advise His Lordship that it will be impossible to start a school there summer of 1937, but that matters will be pushed forward, with a view of opening the school in the following summer.\n\nTherefore it is considered that no more attention need be paid to this subject for the time being, but that some sort of arrangement, as mentioned in letter dated February 18th covering a letter received from His Lordship on the matter, could be arranged so that during the summer the Whites who have children at Liard would learn what is expected from them towards helping create a Summer School.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 20th somewhat delayed in arriving here, regarding a proposed R.C. Mission School at Liard Post.\n\nSubjoined is a copy of a letter received from His Lordship Bishop Buncz, which caused this Office to \"wire\" The Department requesting a grant. A reply to this request was received today, and it is now hoped that this matter is in abeyance until His Lordship can come to some arrangement with the Provincial Authorities, as to how much assistance they are willing to allow towards the school, on behalf of the \"White\" children at Liard Post.\n\nOn the 28th of April, Father Ross C.M.I. A/c of the R.C. Mission in these parts was written to and a copy of the Department's letter was sent, and he was requested to notify his Bishop, and also state his views on the matter. It was mentioned that his views are the same as this Office's i.e., that nothing much can be done this summer, but perhaps next summer it might be possible.\n\nHowever whilst Father Ross had this matter in hand the attached letter from His Lordship arrived, and so it was considered correct to wire The Department.\n\nAs instructed His Lordship has now been written to direct, and it is hoped that he will obtain the necessary information required from the Provincial Authorities.\n\nShould Father A. Dream come along after all, he will be requested to see the two Indian Sherry Children back to their home at Liard Post, these children being returned from Delap Mission School on account of medical reasons. He will also be given what assistance is possible without expense to the Agency.\n\nIt is mentioned in passing that the Indians of Liard have had an extremely good season with their fur catches, and if the Father does go down to that point, he should be supported by the Indians whose children would attend the proposed school.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nThe Dept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder the Agency's annual report covering year 1937.\n\nAt Liard Post, altho suggested it has been found impossible to start a school at this point during summer 1937 but Father Drea, now here is going to that point to establish a building on his own ground, outside the reserve, and will take Provincial Children as well as Indians.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., June 17, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report covering the month of May 1937.\n\nAt the end of the month the R.C. Missions got under way for their summer school season. Father Drein arrived to construct a new Church and school on their own compound, at Liard Post. He was given to fully understand that the Department was unable to allow any assistance this summer. The data as regards how many Halfbreeds, or whites would attend that proposed school must be obtained first, and also to what amount the province would give assistance.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a special report on the progress accomplished by the R.C.Mission with their various schools etc throughout the southern part of this agency.\n\nLIARD POST, B.C.\n\nFor the past few years the matter of a summer day school for this far-away Hudson Bay post has been mooted, and much correspondence ensued as to the best method of procedure. As quite a few children at this point were half-breeds Bishop Sunds was requested to find out from the B.C. Provincial School authorities, exactly what they were prepared to do in the way of assistance were a school started. Up to the present His Lordship has not replied giving such data, but has sent in Father Drea, O.M.I., with Father Poulette, O.M.I., as his Assistant. This summer they have constructed a very fine Church-School house, also living quarters. Much of the material they brought in with them, and the buildings stand on their own owned compound, side on to the Indian Reserve. The Department has not assisted in this case at all. The number of children at this point that might attend such a school is about half Indians and half halfbreed, it might be that the Indians have slightly more than half at certain times than the Comads come down to this Post. However Father Drea requested to know if he could obtain assistance for the summer of 1936, and he was promised that the Department would be written to in regard to school supplies. As the school is just starting a full equipment would be required, the same as all owed to Mo Dames School on its first opening.\n\nSalary for the teacher was carefully avoided, but it seems to be paid the sum of \u00a3115.00 is considered reasonable in this most expensive locality. A school is certainly needed here, and the very fact that two Fathers are residing at the Post will tend to lift the general moral tone of the Camp. Father Drea was asked if he intended going up to Francis Lake in the Yukon, his reply being \"that he might do so, but not this Fall.\" As the Hudson Bay Company has recently bought up a Trader's Store on Francis Lake, it is quite expected that the R.C.Mission will establish some kind of small Mission house there also. Photographs of the above mentioned buildings at Liard will be submitted later. May this agency be advised as to further action, if any, that the Department considers correct.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo regarding the proposed school at Liard Post the Department is not prepared to decide what grant, if any, can be allowed for a teacher's services until we hear definitely whether or not the Provincial Government is willing to assist. No doubt this information will be available within the next few months and the matter will be given further consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nHowever, we would be prepared to allow a small quantity of supplies and you should let me know what you consider necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMarch 29th,\n1938.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further regard to the matter of a R.C. Mission Day School being opened up at Liard Post, and for which same His Lordship Bishop Bunez was requested to ask the B.C. Provincial School Authorities what assistance could be expected on behalf of the Halfbreed section, no reply has yet been received from him.\n\nHowever, in a letter about other matters he mentioned that perhaps Father Dream, now stationed there, might open up a school for the summer in any case.\n\nShould this take place, would The Department consider the allowance of the necessary school material - sufficient for the Indian Schoolers that might attend.\n\nThis would in no wise mean that the Teacher is to be paid by the Department, or his fare to that point considered.\n\nIf this can be considered in order, the supplies would be ordered at the same time as that of the Mc Dames Creek Day School, for which a Teacher is now being obtained.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\n1. Inclo.\nStikine,\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMarch 29th, 1908.\n\nYour Reverence,\n\nI beg to acknowledge, and thank you for your letter dated March 1st, in regard to summer schools within the Agency.\n\nThere is as yet no Grants for Liard Post or Caribou Hide schools. The former affair, it is thought, is still in your hands for possible assistance from the Provincial School Authorities, for the half-breeds of that community. The latter, that of Caribou Hide is still in abeyance, as to what course should be taken. Meanwhile Caribou Hide has been supplied with books, etc., for them to carry on as best they can. The Department shall be written to once more, regarding the matter.\n\nIt is a pleasure to learn that Mr. Moran will be taking over the Bease Lake School, every assistance will be rendered.\n\nWill you be so kind as to let this office know when a Teacher for Mc Lennan Creek is assured, meanwhile the necessary materials will be requested and forwarded to that point.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHis Lordship,\nBishop Dunoz, C.M.I.,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant nominating Reverend P. Poulet, O.M.I., as teacher of the proposed school at Liard Post.\n\nIn the above connection I would refer you to my letter of December 30, 1937 and your reply in which you stated that you intended to correspond with the Provincial Government with a view to ascertaining what assistance they were prepared to give.\n\nOur present regulations in connection with halfbreeds do not permit any provision being made by this Department for their education.\n\nBefore any grant can be made by the Indian Affairs Branch for a school at Liard Post it would be necessary for us to know what assistance the Provincial Government will give toward conducting a school at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nExtract from letter from Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., dated March 1, 1936.\n\nIt may be difficult to find a teacher for Ixarl Post this summer but Father P. Poulet, O.M.I., who resides at the Post might start the school if accepted by the Department.\nI wish to say in regard to that school that Mr. H. Reed, Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, is right when he says that a few half-breeds will have to frequent that school, but it is also true to state those half-breed children are real Indian in fact and can be and will be nothing else. Their fathers themselves live like Indians.\n\nHowever, I'll write again in regard to that matter when I have ascertained what the provincial government will do for the education of those poor, isolated half-breeds.\nOttawa, December 30, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another letter from Indian Agent Reed with reference to the proposed establishment of a school at Liard Post. The information contained in the Agent's recent report again indicates that about half the children that would attend this school would be half-breeds and, under these circumstances, it is felt that the educational authorities of the Department of British Columbia should co-operate with this Department, if a school were established.\n\nI wrote to the above effect on May 19, 1937, and a copy of this letter is enclosed. I presume you have been unable to get in touch with the Provincial authorities as I have received no reply to that letter.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you in the near future, in order that further consideration may be given to the proposed establishment of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Yukon,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, December 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to that portion of your letter of November 11th which refers to the proposed school at Liard Post, the Department has not yet received a reply from Right Reverend Bishop Bunce, O.M.I., D.D., to a letter written to him on May 19/37. This letter contained the same information as was sent to you in my letter of March 20/37.\n\nI am again writing Bishop Bunce and, on receipt of his reply, will advise you further.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs.  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour reply to my appeal for assistance for a school at Liard Post is just to hand. It is a surprise to me.\n\nBecause the Minister of Education at Victoria refuses in the name of some B.C. law to have anything to do with the education of the half-breeds of that Post you conclude that you won't do anything for the Indians of the same Post because you are not willing to contribute the whole cost. Really I don't see how the Indian Department can be justified to refuse education to its wards, the Indians, because the Provincial Government fails in its duty to educate its own wards, the half-breeds.\n\nThis is a poor way to solve a problem of such urgency and importance. The unfortunate result is the fact that the people of Liard Post, both Indians and half-breeds, are deprived of educational facilities for no fault of their own.\n\nTo bring remedy to that deplorable situation and help a good cause I would gladly accept to keep a teacher at Liard Post with a salary of $60.00 per month, viz: half of what it should be, hoping that by next year the tangle existing between the two departments may be unraveled.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 29 and previous correspondence in connection with the proposed establishment of a school at Liard Post I am in receipt of a letter from Right Reverend E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I., in which he states that the Provincial Department of Education has refused to contribute toward the cost of this school. For your information I enclose a copy of our reply to Bishop Bunoz.\n\nYou might let me know what supplies you consider that we might allow this school in the event of the Bishop deciding to operate it without receiving a grant for the teacher's salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nCopy sent to Indian Agent Reed\n\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the proposed school at Liard Post.\n\nInformation that we have received indicates that in the event of the establishment of a school at least half of those attending would be half breeds and this Department is not responsible for the education of half breeds. Their education should be provided by the provincial educational authorities. We are prepared to co-operate with them in conducting a school at Liard Post but we are not willing to contribute the whole cost.\n\nWe will forward a few school supplies for the use of the Indian children in the event of your deciding to operate the school without receiving grants toward the teacher's salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. A. M. Bunoz, C.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nApril 24th, 1936.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAlthough I had no hope of success, yet at your suggestion I have appealed to the Government at Victoria asking them to co-operate with the Indian Department in the support of a Summer school at Liard Post because of the half-breeds who live there and who have a right to be provided with educational facilities by the Provincial Government.\n\nThe Hon. G. Weir, Minister of Education answered me first that he would give consideration to my letter and just lately I have received his formal answer, it is verbatim as follows:\n\n\"On consideration of the request made in your letter of the 28th ultimo, I find that the Department of Education has no authority to make a grant for a Summer school for Indians and half-breeds. As you are aware, we are governed by the provisions of the public schools Act in the making of grants for school purposes. There is no provision of the Act under which we could contribute to the cost of a private school such as you propose. I regret therefore to inform you that this Department is unable to accede to your request for a grant of 50% of the cost of operating a school at Liard Post for Indians and half-breeds during the four Summer months.\"\n\nThis answer is no surprise to me, for I have watched for long years the policy of the B.C. Government with regard to Indians, even half-breeds when they are mingled with Indians. Victoria has never contributed a cent towards their welfare, so far as I know.\n\nNow it is up to the Indian Department to provide for a Summer School at Liard Post. Abandoned by the Provincial Government these poor people should not be abandoned also by\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.  \nApril 24, 1936.\n\nthe Federal Government. They want a school very badly; it has been promised to them and they count on it for this Summer. Hence as the season is advanced I propose Father Poulet as a teacher. He is on the spot; kindly give him some salary and he will start the school on time.\n\nHoping that this solution of the problem, being the only humane one, will be agreeable to the Department, I am, with anticipated thanks\n\nYours very truly,\n\n+ E.M. Bunez, O.M.I.\nEp.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nExtract from letter dated July 27th, 1938, from Indian Agent Harper Reed, original on file 160-5:\n\nLiard Post, B.C. As the Department fully knows this location is to say the least of the matter - a trouble spot. Even this year whilst Bishop Coudret was down that day, another bad break out of drunkenness took place. This attracts all the Indians who can come from other Posts, and this summer they all congregated here. Therefore, his Lordship saw many Indians and many children, mostly of the McDames district. Really there are very few Indian children located at this spot, who can be stated as Liard Indians.\n\nAt the time the McDames School was started, Father Allard was in charge, that was about 8 years ago. After the building was three parts finished Father Allard turned his attention to Liard Post, at the end of each summer. Then the white men who were married to Indian women requested to have a school started and offered to build and help same along, Watson, LeCormier and Hazelburg being the prime movers. Father Allard on this obtained a plot of ground outside the Reserve, and matters were started up. But no help was given and matters took on the coating that the Indian Department should do all this, and that it was their business to do so. After the R.C.M.P. Detachment had been moved away, much drunkenness came about, and it has been going on ever since. This in itself has induced many more Indian families to spend their summers at Liard Post.\n\nHowever, it was decided by the R.C. Missions to build a Church at Liard Post on their own compound, and this they have accomplished. His Lordship stated that here would be a very fine place to establish a winter school. This office would rather not say as to if this would be a success or not. It can be seen that there would be trouble ahead, for Liard Post is only 6 miles south of the Yukon Boundary Line and nearly all the real Liard Post Indians are really Yukon trappers. It can be seen that most of the Indian families would at once request Relief, they would not trap for a living but would trap for luxuries only. The cost would be great at this remote location.\nand it would certainly draw Indian families from other points, in fact McDames Creek Indians would no doubt go to Liard Post. Another point to be considered is that of law and order; it is hopeless to try and do anything down there until some detachment of Police is allowed.\n\nAgain - the Edmonton Air Plane Mail Service has just established base on Watson's Lake, a very suitable point 30 miles within the Yukon, and it is now understood that Mr. Watson is running a store. If this is so, and it will be checked later on in the season, Liard Post as it is today, will go back to just a small trading spot, a meeting place of the Dease River and the Liard River proper. The matter seems to be a real problem at the present time but will be looked into and reported upon when the summer's visit to here has been completed.\n\nFrom the office point of view all these schools must be taken in conjunction with the Indians' trapping affairs - otherwise it results into a mere question of rations and relief.

The Mission was seen, and its two Fathers informed that no assistance, except school material could be allowed them unless the Province came through with their share of school grant for the halfbreeds attending.

Indians simply have to trap - there is no other revenue, and there is always a long summer ahead for Mission Work - The Fathers saw the point and fully agreed.\n\nFur returns were a little under last year's - not too good, with prices very low, meaning that more fur has to be taken.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

As it flies, the Stilt Sandpiper carries its bill aimed down at an angle between the vertical and horizontal. The Yellowlegs holds it between 45 degrees and the horizontal. It will raise its wings and plunge its head down beneath the surface if necessary, to procure mud or other food, and of course once it has done so it drags its tail sticks up at a greater angle than the latter's.\n\nImmature Marsh Hawk\n\nImmature Marsh Hawks are shifting for themselves, and become a regular part of the marsh and woodland scene. As they fly back and forth, turning and banking, you see the white rump patch and the rusty-brown back. They are not exactly like either parent, but they resemble the female. Where she is gray-brown with streaks there are more orangish-brown with less contrast across breast. Very few adults are in evidence, the proportion of the young to the old is probably very large.\n\nSuch analysis shows that the most common small mammal, the shore-birds almost invariably fly up in silence when one passes by, for in silence they do not hear them. They can capture small birds when they can capture them, and we can appreciate them. Sandpipers are much as did gunners of 50 years ago.\n\nPiloted Woodpecker Large\n\nIn the woods across the country we have the Piloted Woodpecker. Better known as the pileated woodpecker (crow size) it is fairly frequently seen. It is all black and white except for the red crest. The male is scarlet, in the female only the top half is scarlet, the rest being brown. The male has a metallic wine-colored moustache mark; the female a black one. The Piloted Woodpecker is the largest of the Flicker family, and much louder, and their sharpness makes them ring across the distance in a way which the smaller flicker never can.\n\nCanadian Girls Wave Way Around World\n\nLondon \u2014 Two Canadian girls from White Wood, Saskatchewan, who are \"waving\" their way round the world, have opened a dressmaking shop in Sunderland.\n\nThe girls, Lena Ramsey and Isabella Pruden, aged 18, are both formerly working at Leicester and intend to make Edinburgh their next stop after their flight to Paris and Berlin and so on around the world.\n\nAN ARGUMENT\n\nSaid the pencil to the rubber:\n\nYour manner I deplore;\n\nThe lines I drew were beautiful;\n\nI won't draw any more.\n\nI think it's very important\n\nSuch striving to erase\n\nThe members of the pencil box\n\nAll think it a disgrace.\n\nSaid the paper to the pencil:\n\nYour marks were very heavy when\n\nThey should have been quite\n\nAs the rubber's right.\n\nI hope you'll beg his pardon and\n\nJust draw them once again;\n\nFor when you scratched my tender face\n\nI rubbed away the pain.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Girl Guides a lovely place. The Vancouver Guides have said it might be reached by a second-class trip up the beach road stopping to load at summer station. On the wish it might have gold in and touch three lakes and five camp sites within a forest. I wish but why wait?\n\nIf I was living here instead of visiting, I'm liking the Idlewild Camp. We have at our own disposal a big log hut. And like this, I expect I'd enjoy the friendly camp life, and a shower by the sea, and the \"cruising ship.\" And that I'd even wish for some rain. We had at the Johnstone River camp, near the south district at Coldstream, a big log hut where we slept in the bay barn when the camp was flooded. That was nice.\n\nFor you can't have a down here unless it is a log hut at Wilson Creek, and they've got them for seven weeks. Everything is dry except it is smoky from the fires.\n\nIt was wonderful to experience a change in surroundings. We came to Vancouver by train, connected with the West Pacific, and here I am in Canada, in a little section of this vast country.\n\nWilson Creek Girl Guides have been given to them by the Stage Lumber Company. They are at the old log hut, there are three and a T.O.D., and there is a big cabin with a big rock fireplace at one end where we have our fires. It is a big log hut and is a memorial to Con. Mrs. Brown who was the first president of a plane. There are five camp sites at each end of the hut. There are eight patrol tents in residence, with each little camp site having a separate tent allotted. There is lovely clear water for the camp is along the river. It is a wonderful place, company, for I really feel belonging to the West Pacific. Our camp is now in for evening gathering at Brock House with other camps and for some activities.\n\nThere isn't a moment's time here. There's something interesting going on. Miss Pruden, the captain, is always about herself into someone's cache in and stole its provisions without notice.\nStikine Agency\nAtlin, B.C., March 18th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a report covering the month of February 1939.\n\nDuring the fore part of this month the R.C. Mission's general affairs came up for reporting upon and some with their school requirements for next summer were duly submitted. Since then letters have been received from His Lordship Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., to say that he is flying around to all the Mission points in the month of March, and expects to meet your agent in Atlin about the end of March. It is quite possible that he shall return to Telegraph Creek on the same plane when all matters will be most closely taken up with him. They are pushing out their Mission to such an extent, that it is seen many requests will be coming along for further aid with their schools and their various teachers, and it is considered that some idea should be given to the Department as to what they intend to do - ere it is done. An instance in point is that of Teslin Lake in the Yukon at which point the better set of Indians come in from the B.C. side of the Provincial Line. Here Bishop Geddis of the English Church has maintained a very fine school, to which all the Indian children attend, and to which the Department has allowed much help. To-day the R.C. Missions have taken up some vacant ground around the Trading Post of Messrs Taylor & Brown, and last summer moved Father Brein up from the Post and started to build their own Mission. Now the Indians of Teslin Lake have quite a Revenue to spend, and being Indians are ever ready to shift their attention to something new, especially if they are made a lot of in so doing. Therefore some little \"rumpus\" might be expected at that point in the near future, but of course nothing much can be done about the matter. Most of these Indians did at one time belong to the Russian faith, and that with the stated fact, that the English Church has had in its keeping, for some years now, quite a sum of money belonging to the Indians that was collected for a new school, or Church, and that same has never been built. The matter is just mentioned for future reference, as going by experience gained on the Yukon River, many years ago; such affairs blow up sometimes into serious matters causing much trouble and expense. However after an interview with Bishop Coudert, more information will be gained, which will be submitted in due course.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo with reference to the school that was conducted at Liard Post during the past summer.\n\nI note your recommendation that the Department provide a salary for the coming summer for the teacher of this school. No provision for such expenditure was made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40. However, as we are not making any grant for the salary of a teacher at Dease Lake it has been decided to allow an amount of $100.00 a month for 3\u00bd months for the teacher at Liard Post during the summer of 1939.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood with those in charge of the school that in so far as the Indians are concerned all Indian children must be told on September 15 that they are not expected to attend school after that date. This understanding will carry out your plan that the parents should not be hindered from leaving for the trapping ground at the proper season of the year.\n\nYou should consult Rt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz with a view to having him nominate the teacher. I enclose staff questionnaire which you should have completed and returned to the Department when Bishop Bunoz advises you of the name of the teacher who will be in charge of the school during the summer of 1939.\n\nThe supplies that you requested for this school are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nRe: Liard Post, B.C. - Summer School, R.C. Mission.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a Requisition for school supplies that are necessary to carry on the school work at that point, in charge of Father Poulett & Father Allard, in Stikine or the R.C. Missions. Last summer we allowed some supplies and with the attached list, they will be well fixed.\n\nMuch correspondence has passed in regard to the establishment of a school at this point. The whole matter was in abeyance for some time on account of the fact that the white men who had half-breed families promised to start a school for the R.C. Missions, but when the time came to do so, turned the matter down. They were not exactly to blame for such action, for the R.C. Mission did not continue its steady attention to that area, owing to the death of the late Father Allard, and then when the situation which had again taken in hand, it was found that the half-breed families were not residing at Liard Post any longer in the summer time. The fact was that the airplane were giving attention to the home locations of their white traders & trappers, and they had no reason to reside at Liard Post.\n\nAlso much trouble has been met with at this Post with single men white traders, much disorder has come about and up to now very no proper or steady police control has been allowed by the B.C. Provincial Police. This has caused another Indian family to come to Liard Post during the summer time. Therefore today we have more Indian youngsters than ever we have had, and of course few half-breeds.\n\nDuring all this time the R.C. Mission has built up a church and a school house on their own Compound, and on which no grant has been used received from the Department.\n\nLast summer as the Indians children were around the Post, the late Fathers there, started a day-school for the Indian youngsters, but no Teachers salary was allowed.\n\nLast summer also the whole affair was looked over, and it is now considered that the Fathers should be paid some amount for their work at school teaching. After some talk they thought that a winter school would be much better than a summer school. If this year's rent does not agree, for the simple reason that were not started, the families would not go out to the trading grounds, no revenue would be obtained, \"utensils would have to be allowed - and a general \"winter-school\" come about. All these Indians are wild nomad and should get out trapping during the winter months. It is respectfully suggested that the Department consider the allowance of a Salary for a Teacher during the summer Months only. The period should be three & a half months i.e., June-July - August - Half September.\n\nThe rate of pay might be the same as that of Mr James (i.e., $110-00 per month). The Teacher will no doubt be most needed, but when considered that sum is really very good, as they more or less, live off the country. Also of course he would be allowed school supplies. The building is their own and not on a R serve, and the whites down there should help along all further expenses.\nThe reason why the month of September is cut in half, is to allow the trapping families to arrange their \"provisos\" or jaw-bone with the stores and get ready to go out. If the school is continued up to the last minute, the Indians will hang on and only crowd up on trapping grounds not far distant. A distinct line should be drawn and the Mission instructed to close down the school for Indians congregated at a certain date. If partly dry at that time, anyone will still allow to attend, then the \"travellers\" will still hang on around that fact.\n\nThe Fathers say \"John Good Ton\" when seen last fall, and certainly a school is needed here during the summer time. The fact that there is no Law & Order here at present is entirely a matter outside the school and must receive attention, in its right course.\n\nTherefore may the necessary authority be granted for a Teachers Salary at this point, and His Lordship Bishop Dunno be advised that this grant is being allowed.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.

The Ware Indians especially are growing in number and are well deserving people.\n\nI also demand that an undenominational teacher be appointed at Teslin, Yukon, because fully one half of the children of school age have joined or returned to the Catholic Church as they have now a priest visiting them.\n\nHoping that you will find these applications reasonable and just, I am.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

Liard Post B.C. and \"Lower Post\" are one and the same place.\n\nThis mission effort has been covered under Liard Post B.C. and under the authority granted in letter dated March 3rd 158-6-1, the school at this point will be opened with the Department's Teachers salary assistance this summer.\n\nAlso perhaps a mix-up has come about between Bishop Bunoz of Prince Rupert and Bishop Corudret who is moving around the District and really taking over the duties of Bishop Bunoz.\n\nHowever this District is being visited as soon as possible this spring, and meanwhile the school is being run by Father Pauliste O.M.I. who has created a very fine Church-School building on their own compound at Liard Post, which is entirely off the Indian reserves.\n\nIt is hoped that the above is clear, and the assistance now allowed is sufficient until such matters are again reported upon.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nUnder Reference 156-6-1, The R.C.

The School term will be for 3\u00bd months but same will end as at September 15th, 1939.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bunoz writes to say that Father P. Poulet will be the Teacher at that point, and this Office considers that quite in order. All natives and halfbreeds at that point belong to the R.C. Mission. Moreover this location is so remote that the cost of travel for an outside Teacher to reach here, and the time taken etc prohibits such being used.\n\nMay therefore an accountable Cheque be allowed this Office to cover the Salary of the above Teacher, which same will be converted into cash, and sent to the Teacher as navigation permits.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

POULLET, O.M.I.,\nTEACHER OF THE LIARD POST INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, DATED\nAUGUST 31st, 1939.\n\nThe number of children have been decreasing,\nas they went to their trapping grounds, and the\nschool had to be closed at the end of August.\n\nMr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, comments\nas follows:\n\nThis month shows the extent to which this\nschool can be operated during the summer time, viz.,\n2\u00bd months. It does good work during this period.\nThis summer the Indians left the Post earlier than\nusual, reasons being that Moose were not obtainable\nnear by, also Inspt. Van Dyk of the B.C. Game Dept.\ncame along and enforced LAW, and as usual the Indians\nran away. Work inspected, done by children was\nvery good for nomadics.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Liard Post. Day School. R.C. Mission.\n\nI beg to submit herewith the above Day Schools Monthly Reports, covering the months of June July, and August up to the 15th inst., when the school was closed. Rev. P. Poulet, O.M.I., was authorized to conduct the school and as arranged under Authority. 1938-6-1 June 1st-39, he has received his Salary for this 2\u00bd months work, as submitted under Voucher No.2 Seasonal School Salaries Account.\n\nAs reported in the Agent's Diary covering the month of September last, this School was then inspected by Dr Meyer and myself, and tho there were a few odd children around them late in the season, the main number having moved out for the winter, yet we were able to see the work accomplished during the period they were at school. Some of these nomadic children do surprisingly good work, and are fast at learning and especially in all sorts of colour work. However at this day school the matter of sanitation is stressed, and every child attending has to wash his hands etc., for which we have supplied paper towels, and soap ere he enters the school-room, and this is regularly adhered to. The Rev Father in charge complains that the older girls and old women come along with the youngsters to see that they do wash, but however, we were not having a wash themselves; free of charge which of course includes a paper Towel. If the whole good work is being done, and were not this short period school in operation, the children would be growing up, as wild as they were born.\n\nThis is practically the first year this school has been operated, certainly the first under salary pay by the Department, and it is now seen, and acknowledged by the Mission that the greatest extent that this schooling can be operated over, will be from the first of June Month, to the middle of August Month. It is impossible to run a steady school at this point, unless all concerned are carried on straight Rations and Relief.\n\nIt will be remembered that this school was first under the care of Rev Father Drein, who to say the least was most active. Later arrived Father Poulet to assist in affairs, with the result that Father Drein moved over to Teslin Lake and started up a new R.C. Mission at that point. This left Father Poulet in charge and alone at Liard Post. Father Poulet's age is about 22 or 23 years, and altho a delightful personality, and certainly a gentleman in every way,\nyet, it has to be reported, that the district of Liard \"cost with its extreme roughness, etc is considered too crude to be handled by gentle Father Poulet. Both the doctor with myself found the other living, as many single men do in the north, from hand to mouth, and it is therefore respectfully thought that some relief should be allowed him by his Bishop.\n\nReturning to Telegraph Creek, Father Carpentier, who is in charge of all R.C. Mission Affairs in this District, and who had paid Father Poulet a visit during the early summer, was carefully approached about the matter, and he stated that whilst down there, he also noticed such conditions and that a relief for Father Poulet was necessary, and that the matter would be mentioned to his Lordship Bishop Burke. It is hoped that some Father more advanced in years might be allowed to take up Residence at this Post.\n\nFor the future it is respectfully considered that the school might be allowed to continue its work next Spring, and allowed to operate for at least two & a half months. That a Salary be granted the School Teacher to the same amount as that of this Year, viz at the rate of $100-00 per month. Also that the school supplies now requested by Father Poulet, be granted also.\n\nAll of which, Sir, is respectfully submitted as of the School's standing to-day, with the desire that this Agency be instructed in the Department's wishes in regard to the future.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Mission Day School.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter received from His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, with regard to the above summer school. This is in connection with a report on this school dated January 10th 1940.\n\nRecently whilst in Atlin B.C., Father DeKeyzer O.M.I. stationed in that Townsite informed me that a Rev. Father Mariel Bobillier, O.M.I., had been sent by His Lordship into Liard Post, to be, it is thought; a help to Father Poulet O.M.I. If this is so it is a very good move, and in that event the summer school will be conducted in every way we could wish for.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Liard Post B.C., R.C. Mission School.\n\nI beg to submit a Report on the non-operation of the above Seasonal School covering the summer of 1940.\n\nUnder Authority 158-6-1 May 21st 1940, permission was granted to open up this school for a term of three months. Rev Father Poulet C.M.I. was to have taken charge with a Salary of $1000.00 per month. School supplies and some more equipment was kindly allowed, and sent down, but the Indian families refused to come in to the Post and live.\n\nSeveral reasons are given for this. Firstly that there was an epidemic of influenza just at the time the school should have opened, and the Indians stayed in the bush. Secondly that the Indians cannot stay around the Post, and live on store food, as they would have to do, on account of the scarcity of Moose and Fish. Thirdly, a reason known to the Indian Office mostly, is that the \"Whites\" have of recent years been coming into this country, mostly from Fort Nelson way, and the Indians are really not wanted around Liard Post.\n\nOver many years now, it has been reported that our Indians down there are being \"crowded\" and that fur resources were being \"gobbled-up\". To-day a very jumpy state of affairs exists, and the Indians having no areas set aside for them in the Yukon, and little or no protection, are more nomadic than ever. This Fall several Yukon Families have come down the Liard River, passing Liard Post and gone trapping down the River from that point. The B.C. Game Department are responsible for a whole lot of this movement, they have pushed trappers up from Fort Nelson, and those that are not permitted to trap in B.C., have been encouraged to move along into the Yukon. In all matters are in a state of \"flux\".\n\nThere are five Indian Reserves set aside for our Nomadic Indians at Liard Post-these are for the Yukon and B.C. families. Yet, knowing this, a new Game Warden stationed at Mc Dames Creek and calls at Liard Post quotes:- Sect.15 of the B.C. Game Act-viz -An Indian unless he is a resident shall not hunt or kill game in the Province at any time. In this way he causes a paralytic effect to take place on The R.C. Mission School, and the resting of Indians on those Reserves. A case in point is that of Dan Loots whose family have always rosted at Liard Post, living on a Reserve there. Because this Indian runs a trapline up into the Yukon, he is marked \"out\" by the B.C. Authorities as a Yukon Indian. Others who are treated as Yukon Families are not able to shoot feed around Liard Post which is situated under 6 full miles from the Yukon - B.C. Boundary Line.\nAs stated above, lately the Fur Returns have been less and less, and unless the Indian produces fur, he is not wanted around a Trading Post, where White trappers will be met with. There always was a rough white element around this Post, and it seems today that they have banded together to have the Indians remain away off in the bush. The five Reserves at this point are valuable, and there seems to be some idea that if the Reserves were not there, a very good Air Field could be created, and \"prosperity\" be established for all inhabitants concerned.\n\nTherefore it is considered that an Indian School at Liard Post will continue to meet with misfortune, and hardships of no ending.\n\nThere seems to be three ways in which schooling to our Wards could be accomplished, and they are as follows:\n\nThat the Teacher should go out to the Indian Camps, wherever they are during the summer time, or remove the site of teaching to the Indian Camp at Fish Lakes, about 40 miles S.E., along the Fort Nelson Trail. Here Moose and fish will be obtainable for many years to come.\n\nSecondly:- That the Indian Department supplies Rations etc to the families who do reside on the Liard Post Reserves, and will send their children to the present school. This is much desired by the R.C. Mission, but as can be well understood would be much abused when put into force; and result in much disorder as between the rough white trapper and the Indian Families. We have had too much of this at that point, up to the present.\n\nThirdly:- That the R.C. Mission be told to concentrate their efforts, in all ways, towards making, once again; the Mc Dames Creek Post their Main Headquarters, and so getting the Indian Families to congregate at this point for their summer visits to the trading Post. Perhaps it would be possible to issue some Rations to the families whose youngsters attend school at this point, in an effort to keep them away from Liard Post, itself.\n\nAn attempt will be made to call on Father Poulet this winter on way to the Atlin Winter Inspection, when his views will be obtained; it having been impossible to visit this point during the past summer.\n\nFrom every view-point of common sense, there is no doubt but what a R.C.M.P. Constable should be stationed at Liard Post, there is a back area of the Yukon here, that requires some real attention today. However should the B.C. Authorities have the power to stop our Nomads \"Hunting & Fishing\" in B.C. during the summers, it is not quite known what events will come about as about half our Indian Families down that way, do go over the northern boundary line of B.C. during their winter wanderings.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nYour Reverence,\n\nA year-end talk on R.C. Mission Affairs was held in this office on December 1st with Rev Father Jarpontier, O.M.I., and owing to affairs at Liard Post, he stated he had nothing to do with that Mission. No doubt but what Father Pouletto, O.M.I., has reported conditions to you direct, but as a visit to that point was impossible last summer, little is known here. Prince Rupert is more in touch with Liard Post than we are at this point.\n\nHowever, it is known that the Indians have given up coming to that post during the summer months. It's impossible for the to exist there, as meat & fish are not obtainable. Atchon Lake is no better, and owing to an influx of \"whites\" meat etc will be harder to obtain than ever.\n\nLast summer, and also this winter the Indians have settled around the Fish Lakes on the Fort Nelson Trail, a very good location, they say, both summers and winters, and which location has been requested for an Indian Reserve.\n\nIt is required to learn us to if you think it possible to operate a summer school at Liard Post this summer? And if so would you kindly nominate a Teacher for same and state the term of teaching though possible. Last summer it was impossible to do this, as stated by Father Pouletto, O.M.I.\n\nPerhaps it would be possible to give up the summer school at the post and try an operate a winter school at the Fish Lakes, in which event Father Pouletto, would have to obtain a list of families, signed up - promising their children's attendance, and the supply of heating wood for the use of the school, over the term of schooling.\n\nAgain, it is mentioned that an effort is being made by the Indian Commissioner's Office in Vancouver, to separate the Yukon families from the B.C. Families, and only give attention to the latter. How this is to come about is not known here, but Inspector Coleman of the Indian Department will be through the Agency, next summer, and it will be up to him to settle this problem. At present most of the Upper Liard RV Indians are down on the canyons of the Liard, and so in B.C.\n\nShould this come about, there will be few Indians around Liard Post - some will go to Atchon Lake, but will become such a nuisance there, that they will eventually be told to get out. We have a very fine Indian Reserve at Mosquito Lakes some 40 miles due east of McTavish Creek, which is fairly get-able from all quarters, but here again the Indians from the North of McTavish Creek - would not go too far.\n\nThis state of affairs presents quite a problem, and your views on the matter would be much appreciated.\n\nHIS LORDSHIP\nBISHOP BUNCE, O.M.I.,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As reported in Monthly Report Bishop Coudret was given full information re this School in Atlin B.C. whilst on Inspection.\n\nH.R.\nRe: Seasonal School - R.C. Mission.\n\nI beg to submit herewith, two letters received from Bishop Coudret, and a copy of a letter directed to Bishop Bunoz, in connection with the above School, and its future operations.\n\nMuch correspondence has passed on this subject, the real cause of which is due to the fact that the Indians find it impossible to stay around the Trading Post of Liard, owing to the scarcity of meat and fish. Living on store provisions they go destitute.\n\nThis Mission school is situated in the R.C. Mission Building, which is on their own Compound, and owned by them. Father Poulet found it impossible to open up the summer school last season, and how the matter stands today, is not known. It is considered that he will not be able to obtain 10 youngsters to attend. However he will, no doubt, teach any youngsters that are around the Post at odd times.\n\nIt has been considered that a winter school might be operated about 60 miles N.E. of Liard Post, at the Fish Lakes Camp, on the Fort Nelson Trail. This matter has not yet come to a head, for of course the Indian families concerned must be made to sign up their intentions ere the matter is started. It will entail some expenses such as assisting the Indians to build their school building - freight on material supplied, and the school supplies also. If this should be advanced further, a winter season of four or five months teaching is suggested as reasonable.\n\nAs the whole matter is no where near settlement, it is possible that Inspector Coleman, when at Liard Post could go into the affair and reduce facts etc. down to paper, and then some concrete idea might be obtained.\n\nHad it been possible to have visited this location last summer, matters would have been more advanced than they are at present.\n\nFather Poulet, O.M.I., is a very earnest, and rather too youthful to be in charge of this large District. It is understood that he has to make ends meet financially, as best he can, which in that District is no small concern.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

It is noted that Rev. Father Poullet, O.M.I., will be in charge of this school. The usual return should be forwarded at the expiration of the three-month teaching period and this should show the names of the children, days taught etc.\n\nWith regard to the suggestion that a winter seasonal school be conducted at the Fish Lakes Camp I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to this proposal due to the fact that no money was provided in our current year's appropriation for the salary of a teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It is noted that Mr. Reed provided for an expenditure in his 1942-43 Estimates of $50.00 for repairs and $50.00 for equipment for this school.\nCopy sent to Mr. Sampson\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1942.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of September 23 in which you mention the Lower Post (Liard Post) Summer Day School. In reviewing our file I find that we did not receive any communication from the Indian Agent with reference to re-opening this school during the summer of 1942. I note, however, that Rev. P. Poulet, O.M.I., operated the school for a month or more. If he will forward a return to the Indian Agent's office, payment of the salary due him for that period will be made.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Acting Indian Agent Sampson.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of Yukon & Prince Rupert,\nP.O. Box 1614,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from letter received from Bishop Coudert, dated September 23, 1942.\n\nLower Post Summer Day School\n\nWe were amazed to hear that the new Acting Indian Agent of the Stikine Agency had no knowledge of a summer day school being conducted at Lower Post until he arrived there by boat in June; if the gentleman had only perused his files, he would, no doubt, have seen many letters referring to the summer day school at Lower Post; and since no official announcement of its closing had been given to him, and no new teacher appointed, it was self evident that both school and teacher were being maintained; at any rate, if he had entertained in his mind any doubt on the matter, surely he could have written to us and inquired.\n\nAs you may know from past reports the conduct of the day school at Lower Post has been fraught, all along, with great difficulties, on account of the very primitive and nomadic spirit of the Indians calling at that post, and who are probably the most backward Indians of North America. The various war undertakings carried on in that part of the country this summer have still added to the ordinary difficulties; the excitement of the children on seeing so many white men with their strange and noisy machinery, and the various war works which their parents were called upon to perform in widely scattered areas away from the school, made the attendance of the children more unsatisfactory than ever; and so little encouragement did Father P. Poulet, the school teacher, receive from the local Acting Agent, at the occasion of his visit, that he decided right there and then to follow the latter's suggestion and stop the school altogether. We hope, however, that Father P. Poulet, O.M.I., will be compensated over and above for the work he has done during a full month previous to your Agent's visit.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C. Jan.22, 1943.\n\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nReferring to Department letter of October 14 last to Bishop Joudert regarding the Lower Post Indian Summer school which was operated from June 8th to about July 7th, 1942, I am submitting herewith a return as instructed.\n\nThe records in this office indicate that this school is private and as such does not come under the ordinary provisions of Indian Day Schools. No word was received from the Church officials prior to the opening of the school that it was their intention to operate, nor was any nomination of teacher submitted.\n\nThe school was briefly reported on in the July monthly report for this Agency. It was visited July 3rd and the attendance was only six although several times that number of children was available. The teacher complained that he was quite discouraged and did not think he would continue the school much longer. As a matter of fact the teacher was not giving his full time and energy to operating the school as he was employed by the U.S. Engineering Department carrying freight and passengers down the Liard River with his boat.\n\nIf conditions amongst the Indians at Lower Post remain the same next year I cannot recommend that this school be re-opened. The Indian parents show a distinct lack of interest in the school although the reason for this attitude is not easily discernable. These people are at Lower Post so short a time (3 months at the most) and regard it as a holiday time that it is felt the children reflect their parents' attitude and dislike being tied down by school and the parents do not try very hard to make their children attend. Unless the attendance is very regular the short school term does little or no good as the children forget in the nine months they are away from school most of what they learned during the short term. In view of this it is considered very questionable whether the expense of teacher is warranted. The results of the teaching are so far poor.\n\nEnc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWhile the Department is willing to favourably consider any reasonable expenditure to keep a seasonal school like this in operation, at the same time it is difficult to justify the expenditure if the information given by our Agent is correct. I was surprised to read that the teacher did not give his full time and energy to operating the school, as he was stated to have been employed by the U.S. Engineering Department. I feel you will agree with me that in a cause of this kind the success of the school depends on the teacher devoting his full time to the work and interesting not only the children but also the parents. It is possible that an older man than Father Poulet would meet with more success. When you have had an opportunity of giving this situation further thought, I would be glad to hear from you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 24, 1943\n\nRe: A. Hoey, Superintendent\nWelfare and Training Service\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your communication dated February 10, 1943 and which reached here only recently, owing to the fact that your letter was sent to the wrong address; I beg to call your attention to the fact that I have never resided in Prince Rupert, and though I am the Conductor Bishop of the Yukon and Prince Rupert since 1936, I never actually lived with him but was put in charge of the outlying missions of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon; for over two years I made my headquarters in the Yukon proper, at Whitehorse.\n\nI have recently visited our missions of Atlin and Telegraph Creek, and on that occasion discussed many problems affecting the Indians of that agency with Mr. Sampson, the acting Indian Agent for that district. In reference to the matter contained in your letter of February 10, we both agreed that a Summer Day School at Lower Post, under the present conditions, is almost useless. The Agent is of the opinion that only a boarding school can cope with the situation; it is also the opinion of all the American doctors and other American officials interested in Indian affairs who have for the past year thoroughly investigated the local conditions of that region.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop J. LeCoudert O.M.I.,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1943.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Acting Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the Lower Post (Liard Post) Seasonal School. I do not understand the reference made in the second paragraph of your letter to the effect that this school is private and does not come under the ordinary provisions of Indian day schools. We have recognized this as a seasonal school for some years past and the former Indian Agent considered that the progress made at the school was reasonably satisfactory. I am writing to Bishop Coudert with reference to the third and fourth paragraphs of your letter and on receipt of his reply will communicate with you again.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of October 14 last with reference to the Lower Post (Liard Post) Seasonal School. I am now in receipt of the return showing that this school was open for a period of one month and payment at the rate of $100.00 a month for that period will be sent to Father Poulet. In forwarding the return the Agent writes in part as follows:\n\n\"The school was briefly reported on in the July monthly report for this Agency.

While in Vancouver in August, 1941, School Inspector G.H. Barry informed me that the Lower Post school was a private Roman Catholic school and as such did not come under the control of this Department.\n\nRegarding progress at the school, it is noted that in a letter to the Department, dated April 12, 1941, the former Indian Agent mentioned the fact that the school did not open in 1940 owing to poor attendance and that he considered it unlikely that the school would open in 1941 for the same reason. The school did open in 1941 and the attendance was fairly good but as pointed out in my letter of January 22, the attendance in 1942 was very poor. In a recent interview with Bishop Coudert he stated that he didn't think the Lower Post school would be opening this season.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 1, 1943.\n\nMr. R.H.S.

Yours sincerely\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 830-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nStikine Agency  \nTelegraph Creek, B.C.  \nFebruary 27, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of January 28. I am sorry I wasn't able to send a reply to you by the last plane, February 15, but completely swamped with work which accumulated during my absence in January.\n\nI am enclosing the copy of a letter I wrote to Father Carpentier, who I presumed was in charge of the Mission, clearly indicating my attitude towards the plane charter to Klappan, including the offer of 1/3 contribution towards the cost of the charter.\n\nIn view of the remarks in your letter concerning about the blame upon the undersigned for the arrangements made by Father Forget with the pilot for the trip to Klappan, I wish to state that I certainly did not make any arrangement with Pilot Callison, or anyone else, for the trip to Klappan. When I received word from Father Carpentier in late December to the effect that Father Forget had ignored the offer made in my letter of December 19, and was chartering the plane himself, I had nothing further to do with the arrangements. I understand that Father Forget himself telegraphed the Northern Airways asking them to fly out to Klappan, and this fact can easily be checked. Father Forget did not reply to my letter of December 19 and this fact is ample proof of his lack of interest in my offer.\n\nAnother point which you have misunderstood is evident in the 9th paragraph of your letter. You stated I gave you the impression Father Forget might still hesitate to go even though I had offered to pay part of the charter. My remark to you was that I was afraid unless you wired Father Forget not to charter the plane himself he would do so. My remark was made in response to your statement that your Mission couldn't possibly pay for the charter. I also told you at that time that although Father Forget had ignored my offer to pay 1/3 the cost, the offer still stood if you wanted to accept it.\n\ncont.\nConcerning the 8th paragraph of your letter I am quite sure I informed you that I had absolutely no authority to charter an aircraft for moving school supplies out to Klappan, even though the nurse accompanied. As you know, in the past the school supplies have been carried by dog-sled and horse pack, and the trips I have made personally have also been by dog-sled, the cost being considerably less than half that of the plane. I repeat here that unless it had been for the possibility of combining a charter with the teacher, such a plan would not have been entertained for it does not give me, or the nurse, enough time to do all the work that it required on an infrequent visit such as the one to Klappan.\n\nIn the face of the misunderstanding which this matter has caused, and which it appears is due principally to the attitude of Father Forget, I think your plan of forwarding the data to Ottawa for settling is the wisest course. I certainly can do no more than make good the offer to pay one third of the trip, but if my Department feels obligated to pay more they will instruct me.\n\nI am enclosing a cheque for the $43.00 deposited in the Agency office as part of the cost of the trip, and I also enclose a letter addressed to Father Forget from the Northern Airways which I am led to believe contains the account for the trip.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that if the salary for Klappan School is $800.00 as indicated in the letter of even date accompanying this one, I feel that it will take care of any extra expense entailed in getting out to the school, along with the offered 1/3 cost of charter, which will amount to approximately $75.00 if the Northern Airways refuses to reduce the amount they have charged.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRt.Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nP.O. Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nenc.\n\nH.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nStikine Agency  \nTelegraph Creek, B.C.  \nDecember 19, 1946.\n\nDear Father Carpentier:\n\nAs you probably know, Father Forget interviewed me last evening about air transportation to Iskut Lake, and in view of the difference of opinion which arose between us I feel it wise to place the whole thing on record and explain my reasons for the action I took. There has been unnecessary misunderstanding over this matter and I would not wish it to interfere with our cordial relations. I could see Father Forget was somewhat upset last night, and I am sure if he had stayed to discuss his problem amicably we could have arrived at a partial solution.\n\nFirst I would like to correct some erroneous opinions which Father Forget held:\n(1) That this Department had planned to charter the plane to go to Iskut Lakes.\n(2) That I had definitely committed this Department to sharing the cost of such a charter.\n\nIn regard to (1), I certainly had no intention of chartering the plane, and did not give anyone the opinion that such would be the case. Father Forget first approached me about the matter and told me that the Mission would perhaps have to fly the supplies out to Klappan School. At that time I suggested that if it could be arranged and was convenient to the Mission, Miss Humm and myself might share the trip. It should be remembered that at that time I had no word from Bishop Coudert regarding a proposed trip to Caribou Hide with stop over at Iskut Lakes on the return trip.\n\nRegarding point (2); at no time in our tentative plans did I tell Father Forget definitely that we would make the trip regardless of other circumstances. However, up until I received word from Bishop Coudert by Mr. Herman Peterson on December 15, I certainly planned on going out to Iskut Lake if there was room in the plane.\n\nThen I learned that Bishop Coudert wished to share the charter to Caribou Hide, and was planning to stop off at Iskut Lakes on the return, I quite naturally changed...\nchanged my plans about going out in January. The Department would not authorize the expense of both trips. They would be within two months of each other. When you told me the other night that your load for the plane wouldn't leave space for the nurse and myself, and that you could use the space for taking out additional supplies to assist your making the trip to Caribou Ride by dog-sled, I quite naturally concluded that you were satisfied with the way things had worked out. At least you certainly gave me no reason for thinking otherwise.\n\nHowever, Father Forget last night endeavoured to place the responsibility upon me for letting you down badly. He told me that you certainly wouldn't be able to charter the plane without this Department sharing the expense, and implied that the only reason you considered flying supplies out was because the nurse and myself wished to go, and would pay part of the cost. This is not in accordance with what you expressed when we discussed the matter the other night, and I find it a little hard to understand.\n\nI have a proposal to make which you may wish to consider: Miss Dunn is anxious to visit the Indians at Iskut Lake, and Dougeen Dennis has asked for some rations, therefore it is suggested that if you will allow us space for 300 lbs., this Department will share the cost of the trip on a comparative weight basis. This would work out to this Department paying approximately 1/3 of the cost of the charter. The 300 lbs. will be made up as follows:\n\nMiss Dunn, approx. 150\nNurses equipment 30\nCod liver oil 30\nRations 70\nSchool scribblers 20\n\n300 lbs.\n\nIf you wish to carry out the trip under these arrangements, please let me know as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. C. Carpentier, O.M.I.,\nIn Charge, R.C.

I do not know what Father Forget would tell the pilot that for, because as you know, my offer was to pay 1/3 the cost. My offer was based upon the weight of our respective loads.\n\nThe load which this Department had originally arranged to send out was:\n\n- Nurse Dunn: 150\n- Medical supplies: 50\n- School books & tools: 50\n- Rations for Indians: 150\n\nbut I am informed that we did not actually have that weight. The total load taken by Mr. Callison was 1200 lbs which means that out of that total probably 850 lbs. was Father Forget's load. Under these circumstances, and considering too that Father Forget had previously obstinately refused to take up my offer of 1/3 cost, and stated he was chartering the plane himself and didn't wish the assistance of my office, I certainly can not consider asking the Department to pay for 2/3 of the cost.\n\nI also learn from the Northern Airways that the cost of the charter will be about $225.00, as it took them 2\u00bd hours flying to get into the lake. Bad weather made them turn back on their first attempt after they had got within about ten miles of their destination. Then, on the final trip to Telegraph Creek they found the area around the town fogged in and had to return to Buckley Lake for two hours to wait until it cleared. Personally I do not think that the Northern Airways Company should expect you to pay for all that flying time when the complete trip under normal conditions would have taken 1\u00bd hours at the very most. I would therefore suggest that you take this up with...\nMr. George Simmons when he returns.\n\nWhen you arrive at an understanding with Mr. Simmons I would suggest that you bill this office for a third of the cost arrived at and I will submit the account to the Department for payment.\n\nI think it would be advisable for me to go on record as stating that in no sense was this airplane charter requisitioned by this office. It was originally Father Forget's idea, and has remained his responsibility. If Father Forget had not been going out that way I would not have entertained the idea of flying the nurse and supplies out there under any other than emergency conditions. I have already had advice from the Department in this respect, and have been instructed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nBishop J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nP.O. Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the Department's letter of March 13, file 158-6-1, concerning assistance to school teachers proceeding to seasonal schools in this agency.\n\nIt appears that the Department's letter is the result of the Rt. Rev. Bishop Coudeurt's representation concerning an aircraft charter which Father Forget of Telegraph Creek ordered, and I am therefore stating as briefly as possible, the circumstances of this case and submitting the account for the Department's decision as to what portion should be paid by them.\n\nThe factors in this matter which may assist the Department to arrive at a decision are:\n\n(1) Last fall Father Forget mentioned briefly that they would probably be taking their supplies (food etc.) out to Klappan seasonal school by plane.\n\n(2) The undersigned then stated that if it could be arranged the nurse and himself would accompany and share the expense as an assistance to the school teacher, or Mission, but neither then or subsequently did Father Forget ask for any definite commitment, or state his definite intentions.\n\n(3) On December 15 word came from Bishop Coudeurt that he was anxious to share a charter to Caribou Hide, stopping off at Klappan on the return journey.\n\n(4) In view of the Bishop's request it was pointless for the undersigned and the nurse to make two trips close to each other, so the senior missionary, Father Carpentier, was informed that we would not be able to share the trip if they still intended flying their supplies out to Klappan. Father Carpentier replied that it would work out for the best for the Mission as there was enough supplies to take out to load the plane, without any additional extra weight.\n(5) Nurse Dunn was informed of this by the undersigned, and also that she would be prepared to make the trip to Caribou Hide and Klappan with the Bishop, a few weeks later.\n\n(6) Father Forget, the appointed teacher for Klappan, visited the undersigned December 18th and said he would not be able to charter the plane unless this Department assisted. It was explained that a duplication of our work at such a cost was not warranted and that we therefore couldn't make the trip.\n\n(7) On reconsidering the matter it was felt that the nurse could accomplish a good deal by two trips so a letter was written to the senior missionary offering to pay one third the cost, estimated at about $50.00 if we could have space for 300 lbs.\n\n(8) This offer received no acknowledgement so on December 29th the undersigned went personally to visit the Mission to obtain their answer. Father Forget was absent, but Father Arpentier replied that when given the letter, Father Forget remarked that he was having nothing to do with the offer, and that he was chartering the plane himself.\n\n(9) January 3rd, Father Forget interviewed the pilot of the aircraft which arrived that day and chartered the ship for January 15th, to fly out to Klappan school with supplies. He also informed the Northern Airways agent at Telegraph Creek that he was undertaking the charter unassisted and that Nurse Dunn was going as his guest.\n\n(10) Bishop Coudert was interviewed in Whitehorse January 5th and informed of the situation. He told the undersigned that the Mission couldn't possibly pay for such a trip without assistance, so was informed that unless he wired Father Forget not to charter the latter would be making the trip.\n\nThere has been some lengthy correspondence from Bishop Coudert over this matter since it occurred and he has endeavored to place the blame on this office for chartering the plane, although we had absolutely nothing to do with it. This latter point has been explained to the Bishop but he persists in his claim that two thirds of the cost should be paid by this Department.\n\nRather than enter into further controversy with Bishop Coudert over this account, it is forwarded to the Department, together with copies of letters from this office concerning the matter, for their decision.\nUnder ordinary circumstances the thought of chartering a plane to take either the undersigned or the nurse to Klappan would not be entertained because it does not allow any time in which to carry on our work as the plane will not wait for more than an hour or two. The trip by dog-sled is 60 miles, or 2\u00bd days travelling, and has always been made by that means, both by previous school teachers and the undersigned, as it is not a particularly arduous or lengthy one.\n\nIf the Department wishes to have all the correspondence on our files about this matter it will be sent upon request, but it is not enclosed now as it is somewhat lengthy and would consume considerable time to cover.\n\nR.H.J.

Mission to fly Father Forget to Klappan School last January I should be pleased if the Department would advise me whether or not they approve the chartering of aircraft by the R.C. Mission for this purpose without the authority of the Department. If the Department does not approve of such action could they advise Bishop Coudert direct that future accounts will not be approved?\n\nThe undersigned incurred the rancour of Father Forget by refusing to charter a plane for a trip which had always been made previously by dog-sled (a two-day trip), and now that the whole account has been accepted by the Department even though the R.C. Mission was willing to pay a proportion of the cost, it appears that there will be a further dispute this coming winter when the Commissioner's instructions of June 6 are carried out, and a plane charter is refused again.\n\nI am anxious to have this point settled before the next term at Klappan School commences as it is very difficult to secure the desirable cooperation from the teacher when there is dissension over who is to pay for the travelling expenses. I may add that to my knowledge such expenses have not been paid by the Department previous to last winter.\n\nc.c. to Major MacKay.\n\nR.H.S.

Early this month we forwarded a cheque for his services for January, February and March, 1947.\n\n2. Lower Post: We received a letter on April 15th from Father Tanguay in which he requested payment for 40 days' services at this school during the summer of 1946.

Some of us feel that the religious schools waste too much time in learning religion. We do not know this from experience, but some people who have been to religious schools tell us that they would rather have gone to government school, where they have regular teachers, and use all their time learning school work.\"\n\nThis quotation represents Mr. Simpson's view only, who has always shown bigotry against Catholicism. We do not approve of it. At the time it was presented to us we did not understand its full meaning; but now we desire to advise the honorable Members of the Committee that we strongly protest against any representatives to the Government making reports against our Catholic Schools. We were all brought up as Catholics and we do not want to change our religion. So therefore we want all our children to be taught by Catholic teachers. We also want the residential school, if any be granted, to be under the care of the Catholic Church.\n\nSigned:\nDan Lutz, Chief\nLillard Tom, Adviser\nx Mrs. Dan Lutz\nClem Lutz\nLucy Peter\nx Mrs. Jumbo\nPete Allen\nJimmy Lutz\nDick Morris\nFrank Lutz\nFrank Tom\nPat Ciger\n\nN.B.-The other Indians could not sign because they are on their trapping grounds.\n\nCopy for Mr. R.A.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of the check of $486.00 as salary for teaching at the Lower Post day school. I want to thank you for your particular attention in sending this check without delay.\n\nThe school reports have been sent at the end of each month to our Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, but in case you have not as yet received these reports you will find a copy of them here enclosed.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Jean-Louis Coudert O.M.I. is telling me that you would like to have some information on our activities in Shesley last winter.\n\nFather J.M. Mouchet O.M.I. and I left Telegraph Creek by trail on January 22, 1948, for Shesley where we arrived on the 24th. Our plans were first to repair and readjust the B.C. Telegraph building to be suitable for a school, after which we wanted to teach school to the few children in the camp.\n\nTo repair the house, both of us had to work 24 days, from January 25 to February the 21st. This work which, to my opinion, should have been done and paid by the Indian Department, was made at our own expenses; by our expenses here I mean especially our time since as for material we had to take what we had already on the spot. To note again that this extra work was done for the sole purpose of opening a convenient school during fall 1948.\n\nIn case you would like to have details on the work done, here are the major repairs involved: we had to take out the kitchen floor in order to renew the rotten joists; we took down a whole partition and made a smaller bed-room in order to have the main room bigger and brighter by the addition of another window; we then had to repair a very bad corner of the room as well as the ceiling.\n\nAfter completion of the improvements, the Indians were so enthusiastic about them that they were anxious to come in good number the next fall for the opening of the school. They expected then to have from 14 to 15 children ready for school this fall, though I had no contact with them since last spring, I am positive that there will be enough children at Shesley this fall for the opening of another school-term.\n\nAs all this work left us free for only the last week of February, I then taught school to the only six children in the camp.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Coudert O.M.I. came to visit the population during the first week of March and we then went back to...\nTelegraph Creek where other duties were calling us.\n\nI went into rather long details, sir, so that you could see by yourself what we are trying to do for our dear Indians often at the cost of many sacrifices and hardships.\n\nHoping that this letter will please you and help you in your cooperation with us, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Father Edmond Turcotte O.M.I.\n\"Seasonal Schools. The Lower Post School operated during June, July, and part of August. Attendance was fair, but far from satisfactory. Any excuse sufficed to permit children to remain away. The suspension of Family Allowances is not effective in this area because of delays in communication.

Citizenship & Immigration, Ottawa.\n\nLower Post Indian Seasonal School\n\nWith regard to the Superintendent of Education letter dated March 5th last regarding the re-opening of the above named seasonal school during the forthcoming summer months the following is submitted for your information.\n\nThis school was last in session during the period June 6th to August 17th inclusive 1949. At that time, sixteen pupils were enrolled at commencement with a final enrollment during the month of August amounting to eleven. Of this number enrolled, nine were of white status, either half-breed or enfranchised Indians who were permitted to attend as at that time there were no other school facilities at this point. Since August 1949 however, a new one room provincial public school is now in operation at Lower Post where the above mentioned children can attend during the academic school year and those few natives totalling six whose homes are permanently located within the immediate Lower Post vicinity are also currently enrolled.\n\nDuring the period June to September a number of nomadic Indian families make their summer camp across the Liard River from Lower Post proper. For the most part it is the intention of this office to see that the applicable school age children of these families are enrolled this year in the New Lower Post Residential School eliminating possible future hardships during the lean winter months when children are located in isolated bush camps and not accessible, for the greater part of the year, to educational facilities.\n\nAs a result, this office would not recommend the re-opening of the seasonal school as the small number which would be available for enrollment particularly...\nSuperintendent of Education\n\n...........particularly when the new Residential School is available now at this point together with that of the local Provincial School coupled with the fact that a two month short term would not in the opinion of this office justify the cost of operation in this instance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nC.C. for Major Davey, Inspector of Schools for B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 030 - 1 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT GENERAL\n\nR.C.

The usual return should be forwarded at the expiration of the three-month teaching period and this should show the names of the children, days taught etc.\n\nWith regard to the suggestion that a winter seasonal school be conducted at the Fish Lakes Camp I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to this proposal due to the fact that no money was provided in our current year's appropriation for the salary of a teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Indian Agent generally blamed on your Department.\n\nThis year I forward to you a requisition form and send one to Indian Agent. I wish to have the supplies for 1947 sent some before the end of the present term; that means before September.\n\nI hope you be able to do so.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. J-P. Tanguay, O.M.I.,\nLower Post, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a requisition for school supplies received from Rev. Tanguay O.M.I., teacher of the Lower Post Seasonal School.\n\nFather Tanguay states that Father Forget, who was in charge of the school last summer, sent in a requisition for supplies last fall, but that they have not been received. I believe that they were to be sent in care of Rev. P. Poulet, Watson Lake, Y.T.\n\nIf Father Forget's requisition has not been filled will the department please ship the supplies requested by Father Tanguay immediately. His school opened June 3, and will close early in August.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.H.S.

This material has been sent for last August, 1947, but has not been delivered yet. If you would be kind enough to see to it that the required material be sent as quickly as possible, we would be very thankful.\n\nThe New Monthly Day School return book has not been sent either. And finally we have in our school files only few no. or Vol. 1 of Indian School Bulletin. We should appreciate very much to have Vol 2 complete.\n\nThis requisition could not be sent any sooner because I arrived here just for the opening of the school; I do not send the present through our Indian Agent Office to prevent delay, since all the material is needed right now.\n\nThanking you for your service and interest in our schools,\n\nI remain truly yours,\n\nF. Edmond Lurene O.M.I., B.A.\nJune 16, 1948.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nWe have received a letter from Reverend F.E. Turenne in which he states that he opened the Lower Post School on the first instant. He states that there are no supplies in the school. Our records show that supplies for this school were ordered on December 3, 1947 from the Government Stationery Office and were to be shipped as follows:\n\nThe Teacher,\nLower Post R.C. Day School,\nPost Office - Watson Lake\nExpress Office - Whitehorse.\n\nWe also forwarded another requisition to the Stationery Office on March 9th. The supplies ordered on this requisition were addressed to you - see our letter of March 9th, 1948. As we received no reply to that letter we presumed that the supplies reached you. Please arrange for their immediate delivery to the Lower Post School so that the work at that school will not be unduly hindered.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 25, 1948.\n\nTo: Superintendent, Stikine Agency.\nFrom: District Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRe: School Supplies, Lower Post Seasonal School.\n\nI refer to the letter of Mr. Phelan, dated June 16, 1948, concerning the supplies for the above mentioned school. I cannot understand the statement of Father Turenne that \"there are no supplies in the school\". When I visited the school several shortages were noted but the school was quite capable of operating. I drew the Reverend Father's attention to a number of articles which should be requisitioned and he made no reference to his failure to receive supplies previously requisitioned. His chief concern appeared to be janitor's supplies which were urgently required. These I asked you to purchase locally to save time. I also drew his attention to requirements in the way of texts and asked him to requisition these in the normal way as they could not be secured before the end of the present term in any case.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDept. file 158-6-1 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to the Department's enquiry of June 16, wherein they inform that Rev. Turenne reports there were no supplies at the Lower Post School, attached hereto is a memorandum from Mr. R.F. Davey, District School Inspector, who visited Lower Post Seasonal School June 16th.\n\nRev. Turenne was interviewed by the undersigned June 14th, but apart from mentioning that a few items of the previous year's requisition had not been received, there was no discussion, or complaint of there being no supplies at the school. It was suggested to Father Turenne that possibly the cause for some items being short was the difficulty in obtaining them. At that interview Father Turenne mentioned also that he had written to the Department drawing the shortages to their attention.\n\nThe supplies for Lower Post school did not come to this office. Letter of March 19th last from this office recommended that supplies for this school be shipped directly to Lower Post, and it is presumed that is how they were shipped.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson, Supt.,\nStikine Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith further reference to the Department's letter of June 16th, file 158-6-1 (E.1) and my reply of June 26th, I have to advise that a package of school supplies addressed to the undersigned at Telegraph Creek and marked for the Lower Post School has just been received. The package weighs 67 lbs. No doubt these are the supplies which Father Tureene expected.\n\nThese supplies are being forwarded by express on the first boat leaving here and should reach Lower Post School about middle of July.\n\nReference is made again to my letter of March 19th, which recommended supplies for Lower Post school be sent direct to:\n\nThe Teacher,\nLower Post School,\nLower Post, B.C.\n\nApparently this suggestion was overlooked and this has caused considerable delay.\n\n(Sgd) R.H.S.

E. Turenne, Lower Post Indian Day School, in care of this office, was received here yesterday. The air express charges are $14.40, from Carcross to Telegraph Creek.\n\nLower Post Day School is about 275 miles from Telegraph Creek, and it will now be necessary to re-ship this parcel at an additional expense to the Department. Way the attention of the Department again be drawn to my letter of March 19, 1948, wherein it was recommended in section (2) that supplies for Lower Post school be shipped directly to Lower Post, B.C., via Watson Lake, Y.T., by parcel post? My letter of July 7/48 also brought this matter to the attention of the Department after a shipment for the same school had arrived at Telegraph Creek, and had to be re-shipped at considerable additional expense, and delay.\n\nAs it appears that the requisition for Lower Post school has not been completely filled it is hoped this letter may arrive at Ottawa in time to avoid shipping further supplies for this school to Telegraph Creek.\n\nR.H.S.

Requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., should be the subject of separate communications.\n\nThis little school presents an attractive appearance. It is bright and clean, and the children are well dressed and clean for the most part.\n\nThe short term which this school operates, (about two months) makes it very difficult to achieve much progress as the pupils are away for ten months, but at least they are under some discipline and gaining some knowledge.\n\nAttendance is always a problem at this school on account of difficulty crossing the Liard River. Several Indian families live on the south side of the river while the school is on the north. It is a fast stream and a motor boat is required to cross without losing too much ground. The parents use this as an excuse for non-attendance frequently. The school is remote from headquarters and therefore no assistance can be given the teacher in increasing the attendance.\n\nAgency Stikine\n\nIndian Affairs.

(only a short time ago I reported on this school).\n\nWe found only three small children present although I saw a dozen of school age playing in the village. The school is steadily declining, and Miss Jackson, after years of faithful work, seems to have lost control. I would respectfully recommend that the Department take up the question with His Lordship Bishop De Vernet, of obtaining a new teacher for the school before next winter. As I understand she wishes to have a holiday, so it may be possible to arrange for a new teacher without weakening her unduly, after years of service.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.E.

Mr. Green's report has also been received. In view of the circumstances the Department is of opinion that a new teacher should be secured to take charge of this school, if possible after the summer holidays. You will be good enough, therefore, to take this matter up with His Lordship Bishop Duvernay and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. PERRY, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. F.C.I.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nMatlakatla, B.C.,\nAugust 29th, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 118547/1, dated the 29th May last, having reference to a change of teachers at the Matlakatla Indian Day School, I beg to say that the contents of your letter were communicated to His Lordship Bishop Du Verneton the 10th June last. I asked the Bishop to kindly inform me what action it would be possible for him to take in the matter. To my letter no reply came until today. I am now informed that the Bishop has written to the Department, suggesting that the Department take control of the Matlakatla school, as he has relinquished the privilege of nominating the teacher for this school.\n\nIt is regrettable that the Bishop did not take action sooner, as the vacation time will shortly have terminated, and the present teacher, Miss Jackson, is packing her belongings with a view to removal at an early date to Prince Rupert.\n\nI would here endorse the view held by the Bishop that the Department should take charge of the schools; and also that the missionaries be given the privilege of religious instruction for a stated length of time as stipulated in a time-table of the school. I would urge that if the Department decides to control the school or schools, fully qualified teachers be pointed to take charge. Most of the difficulties which have been experienced in the conduct of the schools in the past have been consequent upon the churches appointing incompetent teachers to take charge.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 831-1, part 1)\ncharge of the schools. A certificated teacher from any of the provinces should be secured.\n\nAs to salary: it is likely the Department would wish me to state what salary I consider should be paid. I would say that $600.00 per annum would be fair for a start, with free quarters. It is possible to attach convenient quarters to school buildings, so that the teacher could reside at the school; or it would be advisable on the other hand to provide a house for the teacher detached from the school. If the Department were not disposed to provide quarters for teachers, the salary should be made, say $900.00 per annum.\n\nI would recommend for the present that, if possible, arrangements be made for the appointment of a teacher at the Mataskin school by the Indian Department; the salary to be $800.00 per annum with quarters recently vacated by Miss Jackson, being two rooms at one end of the old Boys' Home building of the Department; that the Reverend Canon Keen be permitted to impart religious instruction to the scholars for half an hour each school day, such instruction to form the opening exercise at the morning session; the teacher to be required to hold a provincial teacher's certificate of qualification; or in the event of a teacher coming from England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales, a professional or other certificate of qualification satisfactory to the Department should be furnished. The school often being composed of children of other villages, I would suggest that prayer and Bible reading only should form the religious exercise.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\nOTTAWA. November 19, 1912.\n\nThe Schools Branch,\n\nIf the pupilage warrants it and the teacher is properly qualified we might pay the maximum salary in British Columbia.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, November 8, 1912.\n\nMr. Fedley,\n\nMr. Agent Perry reports that Miss Jackson, teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School, is leaving for Prince Rupert and he states that unless the Department is prepared to pay a salary of $800.00 or more with convenient quarters attached to the school there will be no possibility of securing a teacher for this school. If quarters are not provided he suggests that the salary should be made $900.00 per annum.\n\nThe Church of England are anxious to give up the control of this school and wish the Department to take it over. I think this would be in the interests of the school, as the Department is more likely to be able to secure the services of a qualified teacher. There are 40 children of school age in the village and the enrolment for the June quarter was 36, but the average attendance was only 10. The question I wish for your decision on is, will the Department be prepared to pay a sufficient\nsufficient salary to secure the services of qualified teachers for this school and others similarly situated. Ever since the industrial school at Metlatkata was closed educational matters have been practically at a standstill there.\n\n[Signature]\nI beg to inform you that it is most desirable that a teacher be provided for service at the Indian Day school at Metlakatla. I wrote you on August 29th suggesting that, in view of the relinquishment by the Bishop of Caledonia of the privilege of nominating the teacher for this school, a teacher be appointed by the Department on salary. To this letter (No.F.C.I.) I have as yet received no reply. I shall thank you to kindly let me know as early as possible what is the wish of the Department in this matter. The school here has been closed since Miss Jackson's resignation at the close of the summer holidays, and the absence of a teacher has a demoralising effect amongst the children of the village.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th of August last, in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Metlakatla Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to pay the salary mentioned by you, viz., $800.00 per annum, with the use of two rooms in the old boys' home building to a fully qualified teacher, such qualifications to equal those required to hold a provincial teacher's certificate, or, in the event of a teacher coming from Great Britain, a provincial or other satisfactory certificate of qualification should be furnished.\n\nThe Department approves of your suggestion that the Rev. James Keen be permitted to impart religious instruction mentioned by you to the scholars for half an hour each school day, such instruction to furnish the opening exercise at the morning session.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to secure a competent person for this school at an early date on these terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Would department pay ten dollars month for rooms in village.\n\nCharles Clifton Perry\nIndian Agent.\nWith reference to your letter of November 23rd last, relative to the appointment of a teacher for the Metlakatla Indian Day school, I beg to inform you that I inserted an advertisement in the Victoria Colonist, which brought only two responses\u2014one from a lady in the United States, and the other from a lady in Victoria, who had just come out from England.\n\nAbout the same time, I was giving a lecture at Nanaimo, B.C., during my vacation, and met Miss Klippert, a lady who has had considerable experience with the Indians, and can speak the Cree language. Miss Klippert was able to show references from Mr. Indian Agent Loring, of Hazelton, the Department's special officer Rev. John McDougal and Rev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon, Manitoba. She was visiting a sister in Nanaimo; and comes from Ontario in which province she took a third permanent certificate, and got nearly through with her second. With these qualifications, I felt that Miss Klippert (whose personality I considered would take well with the Metlakatla Indians) was just the person required for the Metlakatla Indian Day school; and I engaged her on the 14th January.\n\nMiss Klippert arrived at Metlakatla on the 15th instant, and commences her duties at the school on Monday, the 24th February.\n\nIn this connection, I telegraphed to the Department on the 8th instant, stating that the incoming teacher could not be induced to occupy the rooms formerly used by Miss Jackson. The rooms are part of the old Boys' Home, and in a lonely situation. They do not appeal to any person as a place of residence. Miss Jackson stayed in them for a number of years, but she was one out of a hundred persons.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAt the present time too, a sensation prevails over an outrage which was perpetrated at the Port Simpson teacher's residence near the Provincial school. A Miss Churchill, who lived alone, was attacked by (presumably) an Indian of the Port Simpson Indian Reserve, at dead of night. She was badly injured in an attempt to escape from her assailant; and it can be readily understood that a woman would, under such circumstances, be reluctant to live in an old, large and empty building alone. Miss Churchill was employed by the Provincial Government.\n\nIn a telegram to Miss Klippert of the 5th February, I stated that the Department \"may\" pay for the rental of two rooms in the home of an Indian on the Reserve for the sum of ten dollars per month. Mr. Charles Ryan, the Indian concerned, has made ready two very comfortable rooms for the teacher; and it is hoped that the Department will favourably consider my recommendation that Charles Ryan be paid by it for the said rooms, with which Miss Klippert on arrival was well pleased.\n\nI may say I have been from house to house in Metlakatla, to announce to the Indians the arrival of the new teacher; and to impress upon the parents the advisability to pay interested attention to the education of their children by sending them regularly to school. It is hoped that this action may have good results.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a report of a visit today to the Metlakatla Indian Day school.\n\nI beg also to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram dated the 19th February, touching the matter of the teacher's salary. Miss Klippert is quite satisfied with the Department's arrangement, and desires me to express her thanks and appreciation to the Department.\n\nI trust that the improvements, suggested in my report, to the Indian Day school premises may be effected at an early date.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the returns of the Metlakatla Indian Day school for the June quarter, 1913, by which it will be seen that a satisfactory average attendance has been made at the school.\n\nAs to Miss Flippert's salary, a cheque for $100. has been received by her as an advance on the quarterly dues for June. Consequently this amount will be deducted from the amount due to her for the quarter.\n\nThe school has greatly improved since Miss Klippert came to Metlakatla, and as the salary now being paid her was understood at the time of her engagement to be as a starting pay, I would recommend that the salary be increased to $960 per annum at the end of the September quarter next. I make this recommendation also in view of the fact that the Provincial school teacher at Metlakatla is receiving a salary of $90.00 a month-$1,080.00 per year.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 16, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing the returns from the Metlakatla Indian Day School for the June quarter.\n\nWith regard to your recommendation for an increase in salary I beg to say that the Department considers that the salary now being paid Miss Klippert, $900.00 per annum, is fair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Original on File 118547-7.\n\nMiss Klippert is unquestionably, the best Indian day school teacher I have ever met. She takes great pains with her work. She has taught in schools in the east amongst Indians, and was for some time engaged in Indian school work at Kispiox, Babine Agency.\n\n(Sgd.) Charles Clifton Ferry,\nIndian Agent.\nI have the honor to inclose here-\nwith a report on my recent visit to the Ketlakatla Indian Day school.\n\nI would point out that on my suggestion Miss Klippert, the Teacher, was invited to join a Provincial Teachers' Convention recently held in Victoria, where many of the aspects of school work were dealt with in demonstrations, papers and lectures. Miss Klippert gleaned some useful knowledge which will be helpful to her in her class work here.\n\nLast year, Miss Klippert was invited to be present at a like Convention in Vancouver, when Calisthenics under a modern and progressive system took the form of class demonstration and subsequent examination under the Provincial Department of Education. Miss Klippert was successful in her examination.\n\nThese opportunities doubtless have a helpful tendency; and I would take the liberty to suggest that a note of thanks from the Indian Department be extended to Alexander Robinson Esq., Superintendent of Education, Victoria, B.C., for his courtesy in allowing Miss Klippert to join with the Provincial teachers at the Convention this year, during which her travelling and other expenses were met by the Provincial Government in common with the teachers of the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 831-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 5, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Perry, the Agent of this Department at Metlakatla, reports that Miss Klippert, teacher of the Indian school there, was invited to attend the Provincial Teachers' Convention recently held in Victoria and that her travelling and other expenses were paid by the Provincial Government and I beg to thank you on behalf of the Department for your courtesy in extending this invitation to the teacher of one of our schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Tyson, with Royal Commission on Indian Affairs, October 19, 1915. Original on file 427021-61\n\nNETLAKAHTLA DAY SCHOOL (CHURCH OF ENGLAND)\n\nVisited the 27th of September. The building is in good condition both inside and out, and the installation of new toilets has much improved sanitary conditions. Miss Klippert is in charge of this school and is a great favorite with both children and parents. Attendance is reported good and the children making satisfactory progress.\n\nSgd. A. M. Tyson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nEXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF INSPECTOR P.H. CAIRNS ON THE METLAKATLA DAY SCHOOL..................ORIGINAL ON FILE...118547/1.\n\nDate of Inspection,-April 19th, 1917.\n\nMiss Klippert, a few days previous to my visit, had been called to Ontario on account of the illness of her father. She hopes to return so as to take her place again, September 1st.\n\nMrs. Racklyeft, teacher in the junior room of the Port Simpson day school, has been transferred to Metlakatla till June 30. The attendance at Port Simpson was small owing to the fact that the people are away at the Nass river fishing cocolchan. Mrs. Racklyeft had been in charge three days at the time of my visit and was getting on well.\nIn a subsequent letter Miss Klippert said she had not the heart to leave her aged father in so serious a condition. I engaged Miss Hilda Crux, a British Columbia Normal, certificated teacher to supply for Miss Klippert, subject to the Department's approval for this period, after which it is hoped Miss Klippert who is a much valued teacher, will return to her own place.\n\nMiss Crux took charge on September 1st and is making good progress.\n\nThe attendance is not so good as in the past few years at this time of the year. The Indians have scattered and are longer away this year at the salmon trolling grounds. The families however will be returning one by one and this will ensure a larger attendance as winter approaches.\n\nReport dated, September 29th, 1917.\nOttawa, October 13th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your September report on the Metlakatla day school, in which you inform the Department that you have engaged Miss Hilda Crux to take charge of this school until Christmas, owing to the fact that Miss Klipper could not return, at present, owing to her father's illness.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that your action is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from report of Agent Perry on the Metlakatla Indian Day School for the month of January, 1919. Original on 118547/7.\n\nOn the 16th I had the Medical Officer of the reserve,\u2014Dr. J. P. Cade\u2014accompany me to the school where the pupils were individually examined. Two children of Henry Provost were picked out for hospital treatment, one with a very bad eye and the other with tuberculosis. Both were a menace to the health of the school, and the teacher was instructed to see that they did not again enter the school until treatment had been received by them.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise the Department that Miss Evelyn S. Klippert has tendered her resignation as teacher of the Indian Day School at Metlakatla, her resignation to take effect by the end of the present quarter.\n\nMiss Klippert's resignation was received on December 9th, but owing to my absence from the office on official business it could not be dealt with until my return, hence the delay in reporting same to the Department. It was with regret that I learned of her intention to leave as she is a very capable teacher, having had charge of the Metlakatla School for the past nine years.\n\nAs Metlakatla is an Anglican Mission, I have asked Archbishop Du Vernet whether he would like to recommend anyone for the position subject, of course, to the approval of the Department. The Metlakatla School is an important one and it is necessary that Miss Klippert's successor should be properly qualified.\n\nTo avoid any further delay, I would suggest that the Department give me authority to appoint a suitable person for the position.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, December 30th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, informing the Department that Miss Evelyn S. Klippert has tendered her resignation as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School to take effect at the end of the present month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that her resignation is accepted. We regret that she found it necessary to give up the work at this school, as her services were satisfactory.\n\nThe Department will approve of your taking the necessary steps to appoint a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Klippert. As this school is under the auspices of the Anglican Church, it would be well for you to consult Archbishop DuVernet before making the appointment, and the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher appointed by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nThe Supt. of Indian Education is of the opinion that, owing to the delay and time involved in correspondence, you should have, in conjunction with the church authorities under whose auspices the schools are conducted, the authority to temporarily appoint teachers for the Indian schools in your Agency. It will, therefore, be satisfactory, when there is a vacancy, if you will consult the church authorities and appoint a teacher with the necessary qualifications. You should then inform the Department as to the name, qualifications and experience of your appointee. The amount of salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications of the teacher appointed.\n\nIf you can obtain the services of a qualified teacher for the Metlakatla Indian Day School, the Department will allow the same salary as was paid Miss Klippert.\n\nI hope that you will be able to obtain the services of a qualified teacher in time to take up duties soon after the new year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOTTAWA, February 12th, 1923.\n\nSir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you recommend that a kitchen range and other pieces of furniture, the property of Miss Klippert, who resigned as teacher of the Kettle Lake Indian Day School, be purchased from her, in order to partly furnish the kitchen, living room and bedroom in the old agency house, for the use of future teachers or any other officials who may find it necessary to stay at that point over night.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a new teacher would not desire to live in this old agency house, and, if the furnishings mentioned by you were purchased, there might be very little use for them. If, however, you consider that the teacher whom you have been authorized to engage would require the articles, the Department would approve of their purchase. As you are in a better position to judge as to the advisability of making the purchase, this matter will be left in your hands to arrange as you consider in the best interest of all concerned. In the event of the purchase being made, the price should not exceed that mentioned by you in your letter. We note that all the articles are in good condition, and that you estimate them to be worth the price quoted. If this purchase is made you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the action taken by you in endeavouring to secure the services of a teacher, and whether you have succeeded in obtaining one, as directed in official letter of December 20th, last. If a teacher is secured, you should state what arrangements have been made for board and living accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nAfter ten years of faithful and efficient service, Miss Filippert has resigned her position as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nAt the request of Mr. Agent Collison, Prince Rupert, B.C., I have sent Miss Aileen McCarthy to fill the position. Miss McCarthy has had two years' in high school and two years' experience as a teacher.\n\nShe had charge of a class-room in the Alert Bay Industrial School, for nearly two years. She did very excellent work in this position and I am quite certain that she will be faithful in the discharge of her duties, as teacher of the Indian Day School at Metlakatla.\n\nHer sister, who has also had experience as a teacher in the Province of Alberta is accompanying her, and will act as house-keeper. They will occupy the residence owned by the Department in this village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.H. Cairns\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOttawa, February 20, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nWe have been informed by Mr. Inspector Cairns that he has, at your request, sent Miss Aileen McCarthy to fill the position vacated by Miss E. S. Klippert as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nMiss McCarthy has no professional qualifications but has had two years in high school and taught two years at the Alert Bay Industrial School. As she is reported to have done excellent work, her services will, no doubt, be satisfactory as teacher at Metlakatla.\n\nWe are informing the inspector that the appointment of Miss McCarthy is approved and requesting him to state whether any definite amount was offered her as salary. As soon as this information is received you will be advised as to the amount of salary that will be allowed her for her services.\n\nThe inspector states that Miss McCarthy's sister, who has also had experience as a teacher, is accompanying her and that they will occupy the residence owned by the Department in the village of Metlakatla.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.

S. Klippert who had resigned December 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the experience which Miss McCarthy possesses will, no doubt, be satisfactory. Although it is noted that she has no professional qualifications her appointment is approved.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether any definite amount was promised by you as the salary she would receive. The former teacher was paid at the rate of $900.00 per annum, plus bonus, but she had several years experience.\n\nKindly advise the Department as to what arrangements you have made with Miss McCarthy and the amount of salary she is to receive, and also the date on which she began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Cairns stated in his recommendation that Miss McCarthy has had two years in High School and two years experience as teacher. She had charge of the class room in the Alert Bay Industrial School for two years and was very successful in her work. The fact that she had already had experience in teaching Indian pupils will be of great service to her in her present position.\n\nI would recommend that she be granted the same salary and allowances as were received by Miss Klippert, the former Teacher.\n\nMiss McCarthy's sister, who has also had experience as a teacher in the Province, accompanied her sister to Metlakatla, and will act as house keeper to her sister.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWEC/BB\nINDIAN OFFICE,\n402 Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C., Feb. 26, 1923.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis acknowledges the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, re the appointment of Miss A. McCarthy as teacher of the Indian Day School at Metlakatla.\n\nMiss McCarthy, accompanied by her sister, left Vancouver February 5th. I understand that school was reopened at Metlakatla on the 12th of February. I presume that Miss McCarthy's engagement would date from February the 12th, when she left her home for the school.\n\nIn regard to the salary to be paid to Miss McCarthy, she understands that $900.00 plus the bonus was the amount paid per annum to her predecessor. It was on these conditions, too, that Miss McCarthy accepted the position. There was nothing said about travelling expenses, therefore I presume she expects to pay her own expenses to Prince Rupert.\n\nThe Department will please note that there are no white people living in the Indian Village of Metlakatla, the nearest white settlement being some four or five miles distant. It became almost imperative that her sister accompany her as it would be a very lonely place for a young woman to dwell alone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 831-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, March 6th, 1923.\n\nSir: -\n\nReferring to official letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding the appointment of Miss Aileen McCarthy as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School, I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Cairns advises the Department that salary at the rate of $900 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law, is the amount that Miss McCarthy understood she was to receive. Her salary will be paid at that rate from the date she left Vancouver to take up her duties, viz: Feb. 5th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOTTAWA, March 6th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, informing the Department that Miss Aileen McCarthy, who was appointed teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School, left Vancouver on the 5th ultimo to take up her duties. Her engagement and the payment of her salary will date from the 5th ultimo.\n\nRegarding salary, it is regretted that it was found necessary in engaging a teacher who has no professional qualifications that such engagement was made on the understanding that the maximum salary would be allowed. Our appropriation for teachers' salaries is limited and may have to be increased somewhat rapidly as this Department competes more and more with municipalities in obtaining teachers. It would be well in future, before promising the maximum salary to a teacher who is not fully qualified, to place the facts before the Department. However, as Miss McCarthy proceeded to Metlakatla on the understanding that she would be allowed $900 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law, the Department will allow her salary at this rate. We are informing Mr. Agent Collison accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nOn the 8th of the month, Miss Aileen McCarthy took up her new duties as Teacher of the Metl k-atla Indian Day School, in succession to Miss Klippert, the former Teacher. Miss McCarthy is very enthusiastic and has already succeeded in increasing the daily attendance of pupils at the school. Recently an evening class has been started by her for the instruction of young people who are over school age. The class is well attended and is much appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nNEC/B3\nSir\u2014\n\nI beg to report that Miss McCarthy has been obliged to resign, through ill-health, her position as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nAlthough she had previously given notice of her intention to leave, owing to a sudden nervous break-down, it was considered best that she should leave Metlakatla at once, which she did on the 11th of February.\n\nAlthough the middle of a school term is not always the best time to obtain a new teacher, I have written to Inspector Cairns asking his assistance in the matter.\n\nMiss McCarthy is a very enthusiastic and capable teacher, but rather young to successfully handle a large Indian Day School. On account of the isolation and loneliness which have to be put up with in Indian villages, it is desirable that experienced teachers of middle age be placed in charge of schools in these places.\n\nI am forwarding, under separate cover, Miss McCarthy's school returns, which have been made out to the 11th of February, on which date she left.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 27th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that, on account of ill health, Miss Aileen McCarthy resigned her position as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School on the 11th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is regretted that Miss McCarthy found it necessary to discontinue duties. Her resignation is accepted from the above date, and the amount of salary and bonus due her to that time will be paid.\n\nWe note that you have taken up with Mr. Inspector Cairns the question of obtaining another teacher to succeed Miss McCarthy. It is hoped that the Inspector and yourself will be successful in obtaining the services of a qualified teacher. If such is secured, salary will be allowed at the same rate as was paid Miss McCarthy, together with any bonus provided by law. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department, also the date on which the new teacher begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith Agent's Reports on the Port Essington, Kitselas, Port Simpson, Gwinaha, Kincolith, Kitkatla and Hartley Bay Indian Day Schools, for the month of February, 1924.\n\nNo teacher having yet been obtained for Metlakatla, the Indian Day School at this village was closed from the 11th of the month. Efforts are being made, by both Mr. Cairns and myself, to obtain a suitable teacher as soon as possible.\n\nOwing to a curtailed mail service, during the winter months, on the Nass River, reports of the Gitlakdamix and Greenville Indian Day Schools, for the month of February, have not yet come to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools has advised me that he has engaged Mr. T. A. Bryant for the position of teacher for the Metlakatla Indian Day school now vacant through the resignation of Miss McCarthy the former teacher. Mr. Bryant has a certificate from the College of Preceptors, England, and is 46 years of age. He is a returned soldier and was connected for a short time with the Residential school at Alberni. Although it appears that Mr. Bryant has not had very much experience in teaching, Mr. Cairns states that he is favourably impressed and considers that he will make good in the position.\n\nThe difficulty of obtaining teachers for work in Indian villages is becoming more difficult. Mr. Cairns states that Mr. Bryant was engaged at the usual salary of $900.00 per annum plus bonus if available.\n\nAs arrangements have been made for Mr. Bryant to commence his duties by the first of April I shall be glad to receive the Department's sanction of the appointment and salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 28th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, informing the Department that Mr. Inspector Cairns has engaged the services of Mr. T. A. Bryant for the position as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School to commence duties April 1st, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of this action, and Mr. Bryant's temporary appointment is confirmed. This teacher's qualifications are but fair and his services will be continued only upon the receipt of satisfactory reports. As offered by Mr. Inspector Cairns, salary at the rate of $900 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law, will be allowed.

There has been some delay, but I have appointed Mr. T. A. Bryant to the position. He will go North in time to re-open the school April first.\n\nHe has a certificate from the College of Preceptors, England, but has not had much experience in teaching. He was trade instructor in the Alberni Residential School for a short time.\n\nMr. Currie, the principal spoke very highly of Mr. Bryant.\n\nThe salary that I promised was $90.00 per month for the months of April, May and June. He pays his own travelling expenses.\nMr. Bryant is a Returned Soldier. He is forty-six years of age and is a very fine type of man. I feel confident that he will render faithful and efficient service.\n\nHe is an Anglican and will fit in with the work being carried on in that village by the Anglican Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

As offered by you, salary at the rate of $900 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law, will be allowed. It is noted that Mr. Bryant will arrive at Metlakatla in time to begin duties today.\n\nI may say that Mr. Agent Collison informed the Department of the appointment by you of Mr. Bryant, and he was advised of the Department's approval and the salary that will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He has been engaged to teach in this school until June 30th.\n\nR. H.

E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nThere has been a definite falling off in the work here in my opinion. Mr. Bryant is a fine man and has done very good work in the village quite apart from his work in the school, but he is showing signs of old age and spoke to me as if he could not stand the climate much longer.\n\nI should like the Indian Affairs Branch to keep in mind the fact that this teacher has had no Normal School or other professional training and that while under these circumstances his work has been good it would not be in the interests of the children to retain his services as teacher here after the age of sixty years.\n\nI feel that it is my duty to recommend that a letter be sent to Mr. Bryant to inform him that owing to his age it is considered necessary to terminate his appointment as teacher of the Nettlakatla Indian Day School at the close of the next school year in June, 1938. Such a letter might well thank him for past services in the village to the Indians in general and state that it was considered necessary to have a Normal School graduate with a teacher's certificate in charge of the school after September 1938. I am anxious that if the Indian Affairs Branch accept my recommendation the longest possible notice be given to Mr. Bryant so that he may make his plans for the future.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Metlakatla Indian Day School on the 7th ultimo.\n\nIn view of the large number of highly qualified teachers whose services are now available, it has become extremely difficult for this Department to justify the employment of teachers who are not academically qualified.\n\nMr. Bryant has given very good service at Metlakatla, but the Department feels that a fully qualified teacher should be secured.\n\nWe wish to deal fairly with Mr. Bryant and you should, therefore, inform him that his services as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School will terminate not later than June 30, 1938. If Mr. Bryant desires to resign in the meantime, the Department is prepared to accept his resignation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

He has taken a keen interest in the welfare of the pupils and will certainly be a loss to the agency.\n\nOwing to sickness last winter (influenza) some school time was lost which may have accounted for the inefficiency referred to in the Inspector's report. I should like to point out that fully qualified teachers are not always successful when it comes to teaching Indian children, and I think to dismiss a man of Mr. Bryant's calibre is a mistake.\n\nI would also point out that Mr. Bryant started and carried on the manual training classes at Metlakatla very successfully, and in finding a successor it will probably be difficult to obtain a teacher who can and will carry on the dual work. Whilst I understand the Department's position in the matter, I do think it a mistaken policy in this case.\n\nSome time ago I discussed with Inspector Barry, the desirability of making that part of his reports concerning the teacher's work available to them, and in fairness to the teacher, I would recommend that this be done as is the case in the provincial day schools.

A. Bryant, teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of his long and faithful service I hesitate to dismiss him this year. However, you should notify Mr. Bryant that the Department will be obliged to dispense with his services at the end of June, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Metlakatla Indian Day School inspected on May 6, 1940:\n\nMr. Bryant is now between 62 and 63 years of age. He has been at Metlakatla for some seventeen years. Though he is doing his best under the circumstances the fact that he has had no professional training, and as a result holds no certificates, makes it almost impossible for me to assist him. He is too old to understand what I want done. The children have suffered through his inability to teach anything but the subjects of reading arithmetic and spelling in a satisfactory manner, and in even these subjects he has no idea of what is now required. I have done my best with him for years but to no great success.\n\nWith a well trained middle aged woman these bright children, many of whom are quite young, would no doubt make splendid progress. It is very difficult to get such teachers now, but if Mrs. Smiley at the Massett School would transfer, and the Right Rev. Bishop Rix would nominate her the whole outlook of this school would be changed for the better.\n\nThough I do not like to do so, I feel that I should recommend that a well qualified female teacher should be appointed here in place of Mr. Bryant. Such a teacher would of course be able to teach sewing etc., and the $50.00 paid to Mrs. Prevost saved. Her salary need not be as large as that now paid to Mr. Bryant. The Department would thus save several hundred dollars a year at this school and the children would make far better progress.\nAt the Metlakatla school there was a full attendance the day I was there. Although the children at this school speak English better than in other Indian schools in this agency they lack interest in their work and do not readily respond to questions.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Metlakatla Indian day school visited on May 23, 1939.\n\nMr. Bryant is now almost 62 and holds no sort of teaching qualification. He has been at Metlakatla for just sixteen years. With a qualified teacher the children would of course make very much better progress. However as he is doing his best under the circumstances, I do not propose to raise any objection if the Department wish to retain his services for another year. I consider that Mr. Bryant should be told distinctly that his services are being continued for the academic year 1939-40 on the recommendation of the Inspector of Schools and not because of any non professional advice. I further believe that he should be warned that as he has no teacher's certificate his further services can only be retained on the receipt of satisfactory inspection reports, but that in any case he must not expect to be retained as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian day school after June, 1942, in which year he attains the age of 65 years.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\n\nExtract from Commissioner MacKay's letter dated June 13, 1939.\n\nI would call attention to the fourth paragraph on page one to Inspector Barry's advice that, as this teacher is now 62 years of age and is approaching the age limit of 65 years, he should be informed that in any event his services cannot be retained after June, 1942. It is observed that this teacher, who is not certificated, has served in this capacity with the Department for sixteen years.\n\n(Sgd.) D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOttawa, December 5, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing letter from Mr. T.A. Bryant, teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nThe contents of Mr. Bryant's letter have been carefully considered and you should inform him that the Department expects that he will put forth his very best efforts and you can assure him that he will be given ample notice of any proposed change in the teaching services at the Metlakatla School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nAt Mr. Bryant's request, I am forwarding the enclosed letter.\n\nI wrote to the Department on July 29th last requesting reconsideration of the matter but to date have not received a reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E. Collison\nIndian Agent\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n26th Nov. 1937.\n\nNo. 14, W. J. Gill\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I received from Mr. W. E. Collison, Indian Agent at Prince Rupert, a communication informing me that the Dept. had decided to terminate my engagement as teacher at the Metlakatla school.\n\nBelieving this was a matter of policy on the part of the Dept., I accepted the decision without demur, altho' it is a grievous matter to me, having invalid and aged dependents, and, since my prairie farm land seems to be a total loss, without any provision for the future.\n\nDiffering from our Provincial school system in which a copy of the inspector's report is sent to the teacher concerned, who is thus informed, I had no intimation of dissatisfaction felt by school inspector G. H. Barry until recently, when it transpired that he was disappointed with the standing of the pupils at my school when he inspected it in May last.\nThis disappointment of the Inspector was a great surprise to me, for it seemed most unreasonable to expect the school to be up to its usual standard after being closed for eighteen days, virtually a school month, together with other loss of time by the majority of the pupils due to sickness by them, during periods other than the 18 days referred to, also to their absence from the village immediately prior to the inspection.\n\nExamination of the register shows that the seven senior pupils averaged only 125 attendances during that school year.\n\nInspector Barry was also disappointed at the showing of work done in the manual training room. He must have failed to grasp the fact that the bigger boys have left and these now taking their place are young and small, just beginning their training; mention of this was made by me in my monthly reports. These small boys whilst learning the use of tools are incapable of turning out anything much for exhibition, but, given time, they will prove to be capable of good work.\n\nIt is obvious that satisfactory progress cannot be maintained with such irregular attendance and I attribute Inspector Barry's failure to understand the situation solely to his hurried inspection on that occasion.\nDuring my appointment at this school I have given my best efforts to further the interests of my pupils. I have taken pride in their progress and have received compliments from persons whom I consider competent to give a fair opinion. May I remind you of your visit several years ago, when you expressed your pleasure with my efforts.\n\nAs I have already stated I have dependents who, if I fail to obtain speedy re-employment will be subjected to distress, and for this reason, in addition to a sense of being unfairly treated respectfully request a reconsideration of the decision made by the Dept.\n\nThis letter is being sent by me to Indian Agent W. E. Collison with a request that it be forwarded to you.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Bryant\nOttawa, Aug, 1940.\n\nRe: METLAKATLA DAY SCHOOL\n\nCopy of letter from Rt. Rev. G. A.

That is a part of my training & teaching.\n\nObvious on however where I have been employed, there may have been a delay, as there has been no mailing facilities, & only boats have been able to make Rupert when seas have been calm or fairly calm.\n\nAuthorities do not seem to realize our helplessness at times; however efficient & conscientious one may be.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB.

I did, however, inform her that I would not be able to recommend that she be appointed for the position as teacher at Metlakatla. It will be noted in your letter #15-8-5887, dated January 5th, 1942, that Miss Fullerton was only a temporary employee, from January 1st to May 31st, 1942.

She was well liked by the people and the pupils. The Indian Agent found her lacking in discipline. If you can get in touch with her she might consider working at some other of our schools and from the first insist upon discipline.\"\n\nFrom the above it would appear that the Indian Agent has arranged for the dismissal of Miss Fullerton and, while it is quite possible he had grounds for doing so, at the same time he should have notified the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M.

She received her elementary education in Alberta and some two years of high school work in New Westminster where she also took a further years commercial training. On completion of her education she taught for one year in commercial school. Miss Fullerton's brother, who was with the Royal Air Force, was killed overseas a few weeks ago and the girl is anxious to go to Metlakatla. She has expressed herself to me as perfectly prepared to live alone.\n\nInspector Barry, after a somewhat lengthy interview with Miss Fullerton, considers that she might well be appointed teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School on a temporary basis for five months as from January 1, 1942. It will be remembered that this school ordinarily operates on an eight month basis from October 1st to May 31st yearly.

I would like to recommend, however, that the Department appoint Miss Grace Wishart, age twenty. She lives at Fort Simpson, and her mother is the teacher in the white school there. She completed her Grade 10 at high-school in Manitoba. She has a personality that will command respect and good discipline. Miss Roberts, teacher at the Crosby Girls' Home, considers that Miss Wishart would be able to teach the Metlakatla children. She assisted Miss Roberts in teaching at the Crosby Girls' Home for two weeks in December when they were short-handed there.\n\nThere are twenty-four children on the roll at the Metlakatla School classified as follows:\n\n| Number of Pupils | Grade |\n|------------------|-------|\n| 5                | One   |\n| 5                | Two   |\n| 4                | Three |\n| 4                | Four  |\n| 3                | Five  |\n| 2                | Six   |\n| 1                | Seven |\n\nMiss Wishart has a sister eighteen years of age who is willing to go and live with her at Metlakatla.\n\nBishop Rix has agreed to nominate her.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nDear Major McKay,\n\nIt was thought that in view of the condition of the health of Mrs. Gray it would be better for her to be transferred from the Indian Day School at Massett to the Indian Day School at Wetlakatla. I therefore take pleasure in recommending that the transfer be confirmed by the Department.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nJ. B. Gibson,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, February 26, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, nominating\nMrs. J. Fray as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\nI note that you are not yet certain when Mrs. Fray's health\nwill permit her to resume duties as a school teacher. However,\nif she recovers her health within a reasonable time, the\nDepartment has no objection to her taking charge of the Metla-\nkatla School. Salary will be allowed her at the same rate as\nthe previous teacher, namely, $95.00 a teaching month.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 168-3-1\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of January 3rd advising that the Department had accepted the resignation of Miss Grace Wishart as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nBishop Gibson's nomination of Mrs. J. Fray for the position vacated by Miss Wishart is enclosed herewith and although it is not yet known when Mrs. Fray's health will permit her return to duty, I would recommend approval of her appointment so that there may be no delay in assuming her duties.\n\nD. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of February 26th approving of the appointment of Mrs. J. Fray as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School, I am advised by Mrs. Fray that her Doctor has recommended against her resuming teaching until next September.\n\nIt is doubtful if we will be able to secure a teacher for the Metlakatla School at this time of the year, but consideration can be given to Mrs. Fray's appointment at a later date.\n\nD.M.

We have been wondering if we shall have another check for February as I quit teaching on the 17th of February. The school was closed two days in between on account of sickness of teacher. And I resigned because of my inability to carry on because of my nervous situation. I believe I could still get a certificate to that effect from Dr. MacDonald of Queen Charlotte who gave me a check-up shortly before we left Skidegate Mission. If you could get an indemnity for the end of February for us we should appreciate that.\n\nAttached hereto is the receipt for the Sup. Refund check.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Barrie Friesan\"\n\nCOPY\nR.F. Davey, Esq.\nInspector Indian Day Schools\nP.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe attached copy of letter received from Mr. Barrie Friesan. It is my impression that he will be paid only to the 17th of February. In view of the unsatisfactory career of Mr. Friesan at Metlakatla School, I am not prepared to recommend that he be given pay for the second half of February apart from the two days taught in that period. It is considered, however, that you should make the decision in this matter.\n\nF.

Miss Klippert was engaged on January 14th. The charge, therefore, is for services at $75.00 per month for 3\u00bd months. This requisition is sent in accordance with your instructions contained in your letter No.427030-61, dated 27th March ultimo.\n\nI am pleased to be able to report that Miss Klippert is an excellent teacher who takes well with the children and their parents, and maintains a good average attendance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 26, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing a voucher for $262.50, salary of Miss S. Klippert, teacher of the Netlakantla Day School to the end of April.\n\nThe quarterly return received from this school for the quarter ended March 31st last shows that Miss Klippert began duty on February 24th and taught only 24 days during that quarter. A cheque for $105.00, being the amount of salary due for that period has been sent to you for transmission to the teacher. As the quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, respectively, in each year, the salary due Miss Klippert for the month of April will be paid upon the receipt of her quarterly return for the quarter ended June 30.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nChas. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNetlakantla, B.C.\nWith reference to your favor No. 118547-3, of the 29th ultimo, touching the matter of Miss Klippert's salary to the end of April, I beg to point out the following facts:\n\nOn account of the dearth of teachers and consequent great demand for qualified persons, it was necessary for me to secure a teacher from a long distance. Miss Klippert was engaged by me on January 14th last, and she left Nanaimo for the north (a distance of seven hundred miles) on Monday the 17th February.\n\nIn the meantime, arrangements had to be made for Miss Klippert's accommodation in Metlakatla. My family all being away at the time, it was not possible to have Miss Klippert at the agency. Rooms had to be secured from an Indian in the reserve and painted, and furnished with the necessary furnishings. This all took time. Then Miss Klippert had to make her own arrangements before leaving for the north, as she had come from Ontario to visit friends in the west, and did not expect to receive a call to Metlakatla Indian day school so far away.\n\nShe having the best of references, and in consequence of favourable impressions I received as to her promise for useful service as a teacher, I deemed it wise to retain her trusting that the Department on being made aware of the facts would be disposed to recognize her services as a teacher as having begun from the time of her engagement, or at least from the time Miss Klippert left Nanaimo.\n\nWith these facts in view, I would suggest that the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nbe good enough to re-consider the question of remuneration in Miss Klippert's behalf, and if it is found possible to pay her the amount mentioned in the original voucher which I submitted, or at least a larger portion of it than has already been paid, Miss Klippert will be greatly obliged.\n\nI may say, however, in my own interest that at the time I appointed Miss Klippert with the approval of the Department, I did not pledge my word to Miss Klippert that she would be paid from the time of her engagement, but that I would endeavour to secure the Department's favourable consideration to special considerations under all circumstances.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nProvince of B.C.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED June 30th 1913\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Amount Due or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Miss A.

(RG 10, Volume 6403, File 831-3, part 1)\nOttawa June 10, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the amount of salary paid Miss Klippert for the period which she taught the Metlakatla day school during the quarter ended March 31, last.\n\nMiss Klippert only began duties at this school on February 24th, teaching 24 days during the March quarter, for which she has been paid. While you state that her services were engaged by you on January 14th, yet it was over a month from that date, or on February 17th, before she left Nanaimo to take up her duties at Metlakatla.\n\nThe Department regrets that it cannot allow salary for this time as the Auditor General would take exception to the paying of a teacher for services not actually rendered.\n\nThe Department will make an advance of $100.00 on Miss Klippert's salary for the current quarter ending June 30th, next, and a cheque for this amount will be sent to your address, which upon receipt thereof, you will be good enough to hand to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

As both these teachers are receiving the same rate of salary and their schools were closed on the 15th of June, I cannot understand why there should be such a difference in the amounts of their respective cheques for the June quarter. The fact that the schools were closed before the end of the quarter was not the fault of the teachers, but because there were no more children in the villages to attend school, all having left to accompany their parents to the canneries, as the fishing season commenced on the 20th of June.\n\nI would respectfully point out that the deductions in salaries on this account is a hardship which the teachers do not deserve, as they are prepared to keep their respective schools open to the end of the Quarter if there are children in the villages.\n\nA deduction in salary according to the time lost is to be expected when a teacher opens school after the commencement of the term, but it seems unfair to make a deduction when schools have to be closed owing to absence of pupils.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain teachers in these out of the way places, largely owing to the enforced isolation and other inconveniences which have to be put up with, and I feel that to deduct part of their salaries through no fault of theirs, adds to the difficulty the Department has in retaining the services of experienced school teachers.\n\nI would strongly recommend that salaries be paid in full for each quarter excepting in cases where the teacher herself fails to commence her work at the beginning of the term or absents herself during the term without reason.\nAs Miss McCarthy has asked why her June quarter salary was so low and as I am myself unable to explain or understand why there should be such a difference in the amounts of salary of Miss Winstone and Miss McCarthy, I would be glad to be advised on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWRCY/8B\n**BRITISH COLUMBIA**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\n**For Quarter Ended June 30, 1923**\n\n| Name of Teacher | Name of School | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to Which Cheque is to be Sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Aileen McCarthy | METLAKATLA    | $900.00                |            |                                      |\n\n**Salary due for 3 months ....** $270.00\n\n**Amount already received ....** $202.50\n\n**Balance due ...............** $67.50\n\n---\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nWhen payment of salary was made the return was incomplete.

Full particulars were not given as to the reasons. Miss McCarthy began duties on February 12th; she taught 35 days in the March quarter and 45 days in the June quarter. However, in view of your explanation of the reasons for the closing of the school on the 15th of June, the Department has agreed to allow her full salary for the quarter. A cheque for $67.50, being the balance due, is being sent, as well as a cheque for $15, being bonus for month of June.\n\nThe teacher should state, on the return, the reasons for closing the school on other than the regular date. I would point out that there are 200 teaching days in the school year, and it is expected that, unless circumstances prevent, teachers will conduct classes the full period, in order to draw the full yearly salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

For this reason he was given the contract, and he was able to obtain assistance for a few days when other Indians returned to the village.\n\nI am enclosing a statement received from Ryan with receipts for assistance. His statement amounts altogether to \u00a31.00. The work is being paid for at \u00a30.00, his contract less \u00a30.04, for scaffolding lumber which Ryan took over, as per voucher enclosed for \u00a30.96.\n\nI would again endorse this account and hope it will be paid without further delay.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E.Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nMay 18th, 1939.\n\nMetlakatla Indian Council,\nMetlakatla B.C.\n\nTo Indian Educational Department,\n\nTerms\n\nOttawa.\n\n| Apr. 30 | To April light dues for Day School | $2.00 |\n\nMetlakatla Indian Council,\nEd.

Merrett, teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School, this school was inspected recently by the Agent. There is no doubt that the supplies requested are urgently required.\n\nThe present teacher's desk is in very poor shape and is an old fashioned table with one drawer. If the Department has funds available from this year's vote a new one could be bought and moved later into the proposed new Day School at this village.\n\nThe pupils' tables and chairs are required for class project work. The tables can be purchased locally from the War Assets Corporation for $3.50 a piece and the chairs at $1.00 a piece, plus delivery charges from the War Assets Corporation warehouse to the dock and transporting to Metlakatla by gas boat. If the Department so instructs these will be purchased locally and they would prove an asset to the equipment of this School.\n\nThe balance of the requisition will, of course, be filled from the D.P.P.S.\n\nF.

C., Vancouver.\n\nRe your 215-8-6955 of March 28th, 1947, re the Metlakatla Indian Day School and teacherage, it is not considered advisable to make any attempt to repair the school as this building should be torn down. It is sagging badly and I am really concerned at times as to the safety of using it. The floors are slowly collapsing, but it may be possible to keep it in use for this coming year.\n\nThe teacherage can be repaired and made more habitable by completing the shingling of the roof and painting the entire roof. I made a careful examination of the house yesterday and it is recommended that the kitchen be painted and the living room and dining room be lined with Donnaconda board. Plaster on walls and ceilings is breaking away badly and to keep the place livable it must be lined at once.\n\nAuthority is requested to proceed with the following work immediately:\n\n1. **Roof shingles** - 14 squares #1 x 5X\n   - shingles @ $10.30 square $ 144.20\n   - new flashings and ridge bds. 18.50\n   - 60 lbs. 1\u00bd\" galvanized shingle nails @ 17\u00bd\u00a2 10.50\n   - 15 gallons red shingle stain @ 2.00 gal. 30.00\n\n   **Labor**\n   - shingling - 150 hrs. @ 75\u00a2 112.50\n   - painting - 100 hrs. @ 75\u00a2 75.00\n\n   Total $ 390.70\n\n   $ 26.50\n\n   $ 652.70\n2. Lining living and dining rooms and pantry\nwith Donnaconda Board\n2 M sq. ft. @ $66.80 M\nDonnaconda nails, 20 lbs. @ 20\u00a2 lb.\nLabour - Laying 2,000 ft. @ $50.00 per M -\npresent contract price in Prince Rupert\nFreight on material Prince Rupert to Metlakatla\n\n$133.60\n4.00\n100.00\n25.00\n\n$262.60\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of August 1st attached, no provision was made in the estimates for repairs to the Metlakatla Indian Day School and teachersage. The expenditure involved will amount to approximately $655.00, but our file indicates, and it has been confirmed by School Inspector Davey, that the repairs contemplated are absolutely necessary.\n\nIt is recorded that specific provision was not made for this work, but I would recommend that the Department try and secure the necessary funds and that authority be granted to have the work proceeded with.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure.\n\n-ms.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 13th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Metlakatla School.\n\nFurther to my letter of even date re action taken in regard to the above-noted Day School.\n\nI recently went over to Pillsbury Cove and inspected two loxstave buildings 60 x 24 each. These buildings were purchased by the Metlakatla Indians when the camps were turned over to this Department at the close of the war. The owners of the two buildings, both of which are in first class condition, offer to return them to the Department for their purchase price of $50.00 a piece if the Department will use them to build a school at Metlakatla. There is sufficient material in these two buildings to erect a two room school building suitable for the needs of Metlakatla for many years to come.\n\nI realize from correspondence to hand that funds are limited under the Educational Vote, but if provision can be made, it would seem advantageous in every way to get this School erected this winter. On receipt of your advice I will get firm bids from reliable firms for the job. My estimate for the work is as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cost of 2 loxstave buildings as and where is (each 60 x 24) | $100.00 |\n| Taking down and removal by scow to site at Metlakatla | $600.00 |\n| Erection at Metlakatla                     | $900.00 |\n| Lining and insulation                      | $120.00 |\n| Partitions and porches                     | $65.00  |\n| New roof, durcoid asbestos shingles        | $220.00 |\n| Brick chimney and two flues                | $95.00  |\n| Painting inside and out - 6000 sq. ft. 2 coats | $272.00 |\n| Clearing site, concrete footings, levelling, etc. | $400.00 |\n\nTotal Estimate: $2,672.00\nIt would be understood that only one room of the two would be completed for classroom use at this time. The second room could be used as a playroom in wet weather and for physical education activities.\n\nOn receipt of word from you as to the possibility of securing funds for this project, I will proceed further on your instructions.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 4, 1947\n\nF.E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nRe: Metlakatla School\n\nI have your letter of November 26th in connection with the proposed purchase of two logstave buildings for school use at Metlakatla. The proposal appears to have considerable merit and although I am not in a position at the moment to say whether funds can be made available or not, I would suggest that it would facilitate submission of the proposal to the Department if you could secure firm bids covering purchase, removal and re-erection of the buildings on a suitable site at Metlakatla. We must have a firm all inclusive figure covering the cost of preparing the buildings for school use, including installation of furnishings, and if you can give this figure with supporting bids in writing I am prepared to refer the matter to the Department.\n\nIn making your submission it would be preferable to include a sketch showing the proposed layout of the buildings.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C\nAir Mail.\nP.O. Box 187.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nNovember 26th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\nRe: Metlakatla Day School.\n\nOn Saturday morning, November 15th, 1947, the Day School building was inspected in conjunction with the Council and found to be in a very dangerous condition. On Tuesday, November 18th, I went over this building again with a competent construction man from Prince Rupert, Mr. Roy Wicks, who confirmed my opinion and that of the Council that the building was unsafe for the use of children as a school. The foundations are rotten and the building is in process of collapse at both ends. The walls are bulging out and the floor has a bad slope. Both end walls are sinking into the ground. In view of these findings, a Council was held and I informed them that the school was closed. After considerable discussion an arrangement was reached whereby the Church Army Hall could be rented for $25.00 a month. The School was moved into this Hall and is now operating there. It is requested that the action taken be confirmed as to closing the School and the renting of the Church Army Hall at stated rate as from November 18th. Authority is also requested to purchase glass and putty for this building at a cost of $9.80. Authority is also requested to submit wage sheets for $37.80 for labor of seven men engaged for 56 hrs. @ 67\u00bd\u00a2 an hour to move the entire effects of the school to the Church Army Hall, including installation of blackboards, setting up of stove, moving desks, cupboards, stock, fuel and all supplies, also glazing broken windows.\n\nThe situation was considered of an emergency nature and the action taken had in mind the need of continuation of studies of the pupils who are making splendid progress under a very capable teacher. Only one school day was lost in the whole transaction.\nMiss Merrett was consulted throughout and she agreed that an immediate change was essential. In fact, once she really saw the condition of the building, stated she was not prepared to continue teaching therein for another day.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 8, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant, file 12-11-1, with reference to the condition of the Metlakatla Day School. It is noted that it has been necessary to make arrangements to abandon the school and rent the church army hall. We will allow a rental at the rate of $25.00 a month for the latter building effective from November 18th, 1947.\n\nThe Department will also pay the expenses of $37.50 which were incurred in transferring the school furnishings from the old school to the church army hall.\n\nYou do not make any comment on Mr. Anfield's letter of November 26th with reference to purchasing two logstave buildings. If necessary to pay for these buildings at the present time, we could find the amount of $100, at which amount the Agent states they can be purchased.\n\nThe moving of them and the making of necessary repairs in order to have them suitable for our purposes as a day school will have to be delayed until the next fiscal year when funds will be available. Please let me have your recommendation in the matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch; Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Indian Day School\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of November 26th from which you will note that following examination of the above-mentioned school building it was found to be in such a dangerous condition that further occupancy was unwise. You will also note that the Agent has entered into an arrangement covering rental of the church army hall at the rate of $25.00 a month. The school was moved into this building and is now operating there.\n\nAlthough it is regretted that the dangerous condition of this building was not the subject of a report at an earlier date the action taken by Mr. Anfield was no doubt warranted and the arrangement is recommended for approval.\n\nI would also recommend that the Department approve an expenditure of \u00a337.80 for transferring the school furnishings to the church army hall and re-installing them there. I do not feel however that the Department should be called upon to meet the cost of repairing the building as the rental asked is, in my opinion, sufficient to take care of these repairs. Payment of the cost of glass and putty for the building by the Department is not recommended.\n\nD. M.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of December 19th wherein he requests that Pyrene fire extinguishers be provided for various Indian Day Schools and teacherages in the Skeena River Agency.\n\nThe equipment requested will cost approximately $250 and although no specific provision is made in the Estimates for this expenditure I do believe that some fire protection should be provided at these buildings as in many cases the water supply is very limited and would therefore recommend that if funds can be made available purchase of the extinguishers be approved.\n\nD. W. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec 20 | Supplies to school & teacherage | $175 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.
