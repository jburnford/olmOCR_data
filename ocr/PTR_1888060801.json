MAVERY.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\n\nSUNDAY CHURCH SERVICES\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 8, 1888.\n\nMINISTER OF INTERIOR.\n\nThere is considerable speculation at present as to who is to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the late Mr. White. As far as the Northwest is concerned, the office of Minister of Interior is the most important in the Government, and it is a matter of the most paramount importance that the gentleman filling that position should have an intimate and practical knowledge of the Northwest Territories. It was for this reason that Mr. White's administration of the department was so eminently satisfactory. The western portion of the Dominion should be represented in his cabinet, and as the greatest portion of the work of the Interior Department relates to Northwest affairs, that portfolio should be filled by a western man, and then only by one who is thoroughly conversant with Northwest affairs. There are very few men in the Northwest who are qualified to fill so important a position, but there is one such\u2014Mr. A. W. Ross. His broad experience has been mentioned, but we do not think that either of these men would be suitable. We do not want to see the position occupied by a Lower Province man, because he is not equally familiar with the requirements of the territories and cannot give them the attention they require. We think that the Government should select a western man who is in every possible way qualified. Mr. Dewdney, besides being a man of more than ordinary administrative ability, has been closely identified with the western portion of Canada for a long time; he has been practically identified with the Territories for a number of years and is familiar with the possibilities of Lake Superior to Vancouver, and is more conversant with the requirements of the Territories at large and of the several districts. He possesses an extensive knowledge of the laws, especially the mining laws, and is familiar with the wording of the existing land regulations; all his knowledge has been acquired by actual experience, he has visited every corner of the Territories and is more likely to bring into his legislation what will benefit the country than would a man who has never seen it except from a car window. Mr. Dewdney has also a large experience in the management of the Indian Department, and is well known throughout the Northwest. We believe that he would be very much better fitted for the position than any other man.\n\nTHE FLOOR CONTRACT.\n\nThat Old, Reliable Killer of Pain,\n\nPains and Ills,\n\nCampbell's Cathartic Compound (Liquid).\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nSchool Books and Stationery,\nPublic and High School Text Books,\nSchool Requisites of every description,\nSophens' Blue Black INK,\nALL Sizes\u2014Writing and Copying Office Stationery, etc., etc.,\n\nTHOS.
