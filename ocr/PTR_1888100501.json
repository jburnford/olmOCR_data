It is very much to be regretted that owing to our distance from the railway, people from the east are unable to visit our Shows and we are unable to send delegations to examine our crops and other contents. A good exhibit of the products of a district is the best advertisement that a district could possibly have, for the reason that it is the most reliable. The exhibit of thoroughbred and grade cattle shows a great improvement over former years, there being some herds on exhibition which would take a first place anywhere in Canada. Some of our farmers have expended large sums of money in improving their stock and they should not be discouraged if, for some time, they get no adequate return. The display of roots and cereals at this show do much to show what can be done and adapted both for Agriculture and Horticulture, while the dairy products on exhibition could not be surpassed in quality. We are pleased to note the increased interest taken in the exhibition by the farmers, and others, an interest which we earnestly hope will be kept up and which will result to the advantage of the district. It is rather unfortunate that there is no building in the town in which these exhibitions can be held; the Agricultural Society should make an effort to secure land while prices are low and erect a suitable hall; we feel confident that if the matter is pressed hard little, if any, difficulty would be experienced in its accomplishment. We congratulate the Society and its officers on the great success of the exhibition. A full report will appear in our next issue.\n\nWe are happy to state that the difficulty which arose between the Town authorities and the Mounted Police owing to the arrest of the town constable by the latter and which at one time threatened to come before the courts, has been amicably and satisfactorily settled. The Mounted Police will not hereafter interfere in matters over which the town has jurisdiction unless called upon to do so, and as it is as it should be, and will tend to preserve the good feeling existing between Police and citizens.\n\nThe following Call says:\nThere is probably no portion of the North-West Territories so badly in want of railway facilities as the southern part of Assiniboina. During the last few years the settlers have been filling up with settlers who are doing well on the lands which they have taken up, and the result is that the grain is stored in storehouses and the flour is stored in stores. The natural facilities are favorable to success, but owing to the present lack of railway facilities, the settlers are unable to secure a ready market. They have frequently made known their wants and have anxiously looked for relief.\n\nThe above language might be more truthfully used with regard to the District of Saskatchewan; there is no portion of Canada more in need of railway facilities than this district, and the Call should know it, and no district has a better right to expect relief from the government in that respect than ours.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Railway scheme has fallen through and it is not likely that it will be revived for some time. It is to be regretted that the Company did not receive such assistance from the government of the Province of Manitoba as would have enabled them to prosecute the construction of that road to a successful and speedy end. The project of building a railway to Hudson's Bay has been regarded by many people as Utopian, but we believe that it is a question of time when the carrying trade of the North-West will be done through that route. The country may yet reach that stage of prosperity and development that would warrant the opening up of the H. B. route, but as the volume of trade increases and our exports become great, as they surely must, the necessity for that our natural outlet will become more apparent.\n\nThe coroners have had to use one of their rooms in one of their Town Hall for a prison. There are three cells all very strongly and securely fastened, but they lack the convenience of a good matress, a cell and which should be put in.\n\nMr. R. S. McKenzie, wife and family of Deuel were in town Monday. Mr. McKenzie's father, Mr. McKenzie, has been in Prince Albert since his arrival in the country. Mr. McKenzie was on his way to Edmonton when he fell ill and his family thought their travel money would be returned by John Smith's Reserve and pay for the doctor's services or medicines.\n\nThe friends of Mr. Porter will regret to learn of the death of his brother Albert who was a member of the telegraph department. Mr. Porter said \"Ah! left Prince Albert last fall for his home in Nova Scotia where he has had poor health, but now that he is better he was better able to leave for the west where he had an appointment. Since then he was again taken ill, which resulted in his death at Woodside. We extend our sincere sympathy to the Deuel and other members of the family in their bereavement.\"\n\nDepot Post Office Inspector Porter arrived by the last mail stage and has re-established a new order office. Mr. Porter has been very well pleased with the way in which the depot post master handled Mr. Way, conductor of the best train in the west. He said that this is one of the very few offices at which there is seldom, if ever, a mistake made. Mr. Porter said that he could get orders on any many order offices in the world, at rates from ten to fifty cents each, sometimes even more. A gentleman made that an person can get an order for more than $100 in one day, made in favor of the same person.\n\nThe depot post office has been made a Custom post of every office very shortly for books, parcels etc.\n\nHORSE SHOE STORE\nJust arrived\u2014A Large Consignment of Choice Groceries, Canned Goods, Pickles, Sauces, etc.\nFifty Chests Choice Congo Tea\nWhich we will sell until further notice at 75\u00a2 per lb.\nFresh importation in Fancy Dry Goods, Millinery, Ribbons, Hosiery, etc., etc.\nFull Lines of Windowcurtians\nIn Lace, Tapstry and Japanese, Fancy Blinds and Shade Rollers.\nJust arrived\u2014Large Stock of PATENT MEDICINES, STATIONERY, ETC.

Rains\nhave started, but have been turned over and the fires cannot be checked.\n\nThe Blackfoot and Stoney have been\ngoing to the North-West Mounted Police\nfor help to put out these destructive\nfires. Everything seems to be progressing\nfavorably for the Haywood House on the\ncoast of the 26th. The ladies are very\nenthusiastic about the project and will provide all the necessary aid and\nassistance. A committee will be formed\nto purchase the hall with the assistance\nof the local, suitable matters, extravagance,\nand a general good time may be expected.\n\nLETHBRIDGE.\n\nFrom the News, Sept. 19.\n\nThe shaft for the N.W.M. & Co. Ltd\nmine near Lethbridge, Alberta, has been\ndrilled and will be hoisted about a month\nafter an entrance is being worked from the\nmain drift.\n\nA man named Leslie was arrested near\nLethbridge last evening with a charge of whiskey\nin his possession. He had been out for\na long time and was carrying two cases\nof Milwaukee beer and five five-gallon kegs of whiskey was seized.\n\nARNADALE MISSION.\n\nAfter crossing the North Saskatchewan\nRiver the traveller will find himself on\na flat plain, climbing the high bank of\nthe river by the serpentine trail, the\ntraveller will find himself about 200 feet\nabove the level of the river. After\ncrossing the river he will enter the\ncountry, and after travelling about half\na mile he will come to where the trail\nmeets the road leading to the lake\nLake and the other to Arnadale Mis-\nsion, in Montana's Reserve.\n\nThe Missionary Society of Canada and\nArnadale Mission is the largest forest\nfor mixed farming in the Territories. There\nis section after section where it is one\nunbroken forest of pine, spruce, fir,\ncedar and small alder; the soil, is sandy\nloam. There is lots of wood for all pur-\nposes, plenty of water and excellent\npasture for cattle. It is a fine place\nin a year for the farmers of the larger\nsettlements in the district. After a drive\nof about seventeen miles the traveller\nwill see the mission buildings of the reserve\nare seen, and about eight miles farther on\na height is found in the residence of the\nlate Mr. McKay, who built the present\nchapel. The latter was erected about\nthree years ago, and, with the exception\nof a very few Indians, the work was done by the Indians themselves;\nit is a log building with siding on the\noutside, lathed and plastered inside and\nvery attractive. Mr. McKay and his\nson, the Rev. Mr. McKay and his\ndaughter and family are now preparing\nfor the school which they have taken to\nchristianize these Indians and make them\nself-supporting. Miss McKay is the\nschool teacher and has thirty-five pupils,\nall of whom are far advanced for\nthe short time they have had an instruct-\ning teacher. Miss McKay, A. A., says\nthey are taught to sew and knit. Miss\nMcKay has taken two first prizes for the\nbest teaching in all the Indian schools.\n\nThe Indians were working hard, their\ngood crops and their grain all stacked and\nare now waiting for the thresher.\n\nThe people on the reserve are greatly\ninterested over a letter which appeared in\nThe Times about six weeks ago, which\ncalled attention to the fact that the Indians\nwere not doing as much as they could\nfor the reserve, and the Indians were\n\"betting in a reckless way,\" and \"that\nit was time to encourage them to work\nmore for such purposes.\" Next week (this)\nhad \"One Who Was Present\" given\na straight account of the whole proceed-\nings and gave a full report of what was\ndone, for instance, told about the maga-\n\nVICTORIA\n\nLivery and Boarding Stables.\n\nBetween Johnson's and Campbell's Store.\n\nHaving enlarged our premises to double\ntheir original size, we would respectfully\nattract the attention of the travelling public to\nour establishment.\n\nWell and river water almost at our door.\n\nWe have also some fine cows, horses,\nand other stock for sale at reasonable prices.\n\nNEILSON & McBEATH\n\nSOUTH FROM KNEE TO ANKLE\n\nThis entirely new.

Leslie, of the N.W.M.P., in interfering with the town council in the discharge of its duties. All the members were present and they decided to prosecute Leslie.\n\nThe Town Council held a regular meeting on Monday night at the Hall. Worship Mayor Blake presiding. The councillors present were: Agnew, Davis-Stewart, Donaldson, Johnston and McPhail.\n\nCOMMITTEE\n\nA communication was received from Sept. Perry re disturbance with the town council. The committee due consideration to the council's failure to maintain order. They reminded them of the very definite instructions given by Sept. Perry in writing to Mr. B. D. Davis to perform their obligations to assist the town constable in every way to preserve the peace in the town, that they would be charged in case of Const. Leslie's actions.\n\nJ. H. Howard, secretary of the Lorne Agricultural Society, asked the council to reconsider the charter of the society. The council went into committee of the whole on this matter and after they came out reported that they had instructed the Lorne Agricultural Society from the funds of the corporation be given to them on condition that they would place an equal amount in a fund for improvement in lands and buildings in the municipality or for some other valuable purpose among expenditures to be made in 1889 or 1890.\n\nRETIREMENT\n\nA petition was received from H.R.

Parents, sons, married, to all of whom Father, eldest daughter of our colony, tenderly gave her hand. The day and evening dancing was continued and kept up. Over 300 persons took part in the festivities.\n\nMr. Bonomi, D. L. S., is here, but your correspondent cannot account for what business. Rumour has it that he is making some plans for the future.\n\nBy now many more reports have been going the rounds that Mr. John Macdonald would be at the clocks Sunday next and people are looking forward to such an event.\n\nYou have no doubt noticed that grain from this district has taken first prize at your exhibition. It is now being fed to the flour ground here. We are sorry to note that some of our cattle have not been exhibited.\n\nOur mill has ceased running for three weeks to make necessary repairs made and to put in some new machinery and another effort will be made.\n\nThe many friends of the Rev. Mr. Kay, of Snake Plain, will be pleased to hear that he is recovering greatly improved and he is now recovering fast.\n\nAt the rifle range, on Saturday last, the postponed match from the regular meeting was shot off, the first prize list being the highest score of the day, and was competed by by those members who did not win a prize at the annual meeting.
