That the stringent provision for two resident settlers upon each section\u2014odd as well as even\u2014secures a population more dense and uniform than has hitherto marked rural districts in the North-West, and, by reason of greater proximity and number, far superior social, educational, religious, and municipal advantages ensue. Already your Memorialists have experienced most beneficial effects in this respect.\n\n(2) That the Saskatchewan Homestead Company is entitled to unqualified approval for the course pursued by it in the settlement of this tract. The policy of the Company has from the first been liberal and patriotic, and speedy development is now going forward. Your Memorialists cheerfully testify that, individually and collectively, they have experienced almost indispensable benefits through the praiseworthy enterprise and liberality of the Company. The very considerable measure of prosperity now enjoyed, the harmonious and neighbourly spirit which prevails, and the contentment among the settlers\nprove, beyond question, that the plan is a good one when ably and honestly acted upon.\n\n(3) That unprecedented success will, in the opinion of your Memorialists, characterize the tract of a Company which discharges efficiently the duties assumed under the Colonization Agreement. Adverse criticism at so early a stage betrays an antagonism that would condemn untried. Your Memorialists have abundant evidence of increased prosperity in the future, and deplore that a laudable and wisely-devised system should be misunderstood and defamed. With entire confidence in and approval of the Colonization method, the Company itself, and its administration, your Memorialists enter heartily into the congenial work of developing and beautifying their respective farms in this fertile portion of the Canadian North-West.\n\nCrescent Lake,\n\nAssiniboia, N.W.T., November, 1883.\n\n| NAME          | West of 2nd Mer. |\n|---------------|------------------|\n|               | Sect. | Tp. | Rge. |\n| Wm.
