As I am new to this territory, I do not know if any precedent exists in connection with these extraordinary supplies, but if they can be furnished, I would recommend that the assistance asked for be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 31, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing a requisition from the Rev. Sister Gabriel, Principal of the Sechelt Indian Boarding School. I have noted the request for a crosscut saw and bed spreads. It is the Department's wish that this equipment be purchased from per capita grant or other school funds. Relative to the need for linoleum in the staff dining-room, I should be pleased to have a report from you, following the occasion of your next visit to the school.\n\nI note that the Rev. Principal is asking for a milch cow and states that there are but two old animals on hand. Mr. Inspector Cairns' report, dated January 4th, last, mentions that there are five cows at the school. The Department is of the opinion that even this number of milch cows will not give more milk than is required for the use of the children, pupils and the staff. Mr. Inspector Cairns reports that the pupils do not receive much whole milk and he strongly advises that, when the milk supply is limited, butter be purchased for the staff.\n\nI have to inform you that it is the Department's practice to arrange for a sufficient quantity of stock at the time a school is commenced. The natural increase in the stock should relieve us of any further financial outlay. There should be sufficient young animals for milking purposes and also for butchering. If, however, the stock at the Sechelt Boarding school is so depleted that the Department will have to come to the help of the authorities, I should be pleased to have your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

No. 153-1-5B\n\nWith reference to Filter Basin, for new school here\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing on instructions contained in your letter of January 30, the filter basin has been constructed as outlined by you, the same has been completed and in operation for some time, and is working satisfactorily.\n\nAs one hundred and thirty cubic yards of rock were required for the filling of pit, and the only horses available here are owned by Johnson Bros., the contractors for bungalow for chaplain of school I employed them at the rate of $10.00 per day of eight hours for team and teamster, and as one horse was used to a great extent in excavating I arranged with them to furnish same at $7.50 per day. Johnson Bros. also have in their employ an experienced man on sewer construction, this man they let me have at the same rate that they pay him namely $5.00 per day. Sergeant is a local man used in loading rock, and helping with excavation, and was paid the usual rate for unskilled work 45\u00a2 per hour.\n\nI enclose herewith time slips or accounts from Johnson Bros. and N. Sergeant, in duplicate and certified, this is the total cost of filter basin, except three days time and timekeeping and inspection by me.\n\nI have carefully checked these time slips with the time book kept by me and find them correct.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur W.

I await your reply.\n\nThe Bungalow was completed on the 7th instant, with the exception of placing of said electrical fixtures and Contractors are after final certificate, which I cannot issue until these fixtures are installed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of construction.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 31st, last, No. I67-18-5, in connection with the requisition of Rev. Sister Gabriel, of the Sechelt Boarding School, for 45 plain bed spreads and a square of linoleum for the Staff dining room, I beg to say that I have since made two visits to this School. It was decided that the Principal, upon visiting Vancouver, would select a suitable pattern for the linoleum required. This has been duly carried into effect, and I have pleasure in enclosing a sample priced at $1.05 per yard (square). Sales 5 (reference). Other linoleums looked at were priced higher in the various stores. I would recommend that authority be given for the purchase of a piece of linoleum size 16 feet by 14\u00bd. The staff dining room is barren looking with a composition floor and the linoleum is needed.\n\nThe bed spreads are also needed as the beds are covered with blankets only at the present time. I would recommend the purchase of 45 medium quality spreads.\n\nThe matter of the cows is held in abeyance at the request of Mr. School Inspector Cairns, who desires to revisit the school and make a further report thereon. He expects to visit Sechelt soon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-2-8 of the 14th instant, with reference to the need for linoleum at the Sechelt Indian Boarding School. In reply I beg to state you are authorized to purchase a piece 16' x 14\u00bd' for the staff dining room. The sample is being returned.\n\nAs you were informed in official communication of March 31st, last, the Department considers that the bed spread should be purchased from the per capita grant. I have noted that the matter of milk supply will be given special attention by Mr. Inspector Cairns, upon the occasion of his next visit to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I was sorry to learn that there has been friction between the staff and the missionary and the Indians on the reserve; but I have noted, with satisfaction, that steps were taken to surmount the present difficulty.\n\nYour action, relative to the children's diet, the rules for visitors, recreation for the children and school discipline, is approved. The Principal of the school is being informed of the Department's attitude in this connection. I am insisting on a properly qualified teacher for the boys' classroom.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase three good milch cows and have them delivered to the school. You should secure the advice of Mr. Arthur Morton, 419 Duncan Building, Vancouver, B.C., local representative of the Livestock Branch of the Department of Agriculture, who will inform you as to the best source of supply. You will please incur no unnecessary expense.\n\nI have noted, with satisfaction, that the members of the Band have been censured for their drastic action in withdrawing their children from the school, and I trust that, in future, petty troubles will receive a rapid adjustment.\n\nI have suggested to Mr. Cairns that you should make another visit to the Sechelt Indian Residential School in the near future and forward a second special report at that time. In the meantime, I should be pleased if you would make recommendations, relative to management and finance, so that the Department can take remedial measures of a permanent nature. I have written, also, to Mr. Inspector Cairns.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nChas. C.

I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as to the quantity of hose required and the dimensions of the same, also whether couplings and nozzle are required, and the approximate cost of supplying this equipment. As soon as we have this information the Department will be in a position to decide as to whether it can authorize the purchase of the hose required or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Swan, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\n119 Pender St. W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nRe\u2014Water Supply for Indian Boarding School and Village at Sechelt, B.C.\n\nWith reference to my report dated May 4th, 1923, I beg to submit the following supplementary report.\n\nIn accordance with the request of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, I returned to Sechelt on August 14th and spent three days investigating the possibilities of increasing the present water supply to meet the present and future requirements of the Indian Boarding School and Village.\n\nSummary of Investigation\n\nBy enlarging and extending the water works system an adequate supply of water may be obtained for the irrigation of 15 acres of school land, in addition to requirements for domestic and fire protection purposes throughout the year.\n\nThe estimated cost of a complete system as herein proposed would amount to approximately $9,000.00.\nAvailable Sources of Supply\n\nAs previously reported the present supply is obtained from a small stream flowing through Lot 2465. This stream was examined to its source on the mountain side where it is fed by springs. A measurement taken above the swamp and about a quarter of a mile above the present intake showed the discharge to be 0.17 c.f.s., about 90,000 gallons per day. This measurement was made after an unusually long period of dry weather and should, therefore, represent as low a flow as may normally be expected.\n\nAlthough the flow from these springs would be ample for the immediate requirements of the school and village, it would not be sufficient for the irrigation of additional land for school purposes as contemplated by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt was found possible to augment the flow from springs by diverting water from a stream, about one mile to the north, which flows westerly and drains into Porpoise Bay. The bed of this stream is strewn with boulders and bears every indication of carrying an abundant supply of water at all but the driest period of the year and for this reason I was fortunate in finding the stream at a very low stage. At the time of inspection the discharge amounted to 0.3 c.f.s. (about 150,000 gallons per day).\n\nThe two sources, at low stage, would provide a combined flow of 250,000 gallons per day.\n\nWater Requirements\n\nAt the present time, the school has an area of four acres under cultivation, and it is considered essential that this area should be increased to fifteen acres. The Department has agreed to set aside additional land and further development is dependent on an irrigation supply of water.\nOn inspection of this land I found the soil to be very sandy, similar to that under cultivation, and for this reason provision has been made for a quantity of thirty acre-feet of water to be applied to the land during July and August. The following is a revised estimate of water requirements:\n\n| Domestic          | No. persons | Gallons per day |\n|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Boarding School   | 100         | 10,000          |\n| Indian Village    | 100         | 10,000          |\n\nIrrigation\n\n15 acres @ 2 acre feet per ac. in 60 days, 156,000.\n\nTotal........... 156,000 gallons.\n\nThe quantity of water available from the two sources mentioned provides a fairly safe margin of nearly 100,000 gallons per day to cover possible losses during the driest period of the year.\n\nProposed enlargement and extension of present system\n\nAn efficient system capable of carrying a maximum quantity of 275,000 Imperial gallons per day, which is 119,000 gallons in excess of estimated requirements, would necessitate the construction of the following works:\n\n1. A new diversion (North of the present system) consisting of a small concrete intake and 2000 feet of wood stave pipe, four inches in diameter, to carry the water to a ravine which drains naturally to the springs below. Under a head of forty feet available in this distance, the capacity of the pipe would be 185,000 Imperial gallons per day. The discharge, however, should be controlled by installing an iron body straight-way gate valve at the intake.\n\nNote: A ditch to carry this quantity of water is not feasible owing to the porous nature of the ground to be\ntraversed. The line of the proposed diversion lies along timbered, rocky sidehill, which slopes towards the pond and drains into the creek to the North, as shown on accompanying plan.\n\nMany years ago, an attempt was made by the Indians, to dam the pond at the outlet, the object being to divert water from the stream into the pond, raise the water level, and re-divert water through an open ditch into the ravine leading to their present source of supply. The attempt was unsuccessful owing to the failure of a crudely constructed dam, and there is now a deep washout at what would otherwise have been a good damsite.\n\n2. A new intake at a point about 1040 feet upstream from the intake of the present system. At this location water may be diverted into the supply line from the clean gravel bed of the stream instead of from the swamp as at present. Details of concrete tank with intake, spillway, screens, etc. are shown on accompanying sketch.\n\n3. New supply line consisting of approximately 10,300 feet of wood stave pipe, four inches in diameter, to take the place of the two inch pipe now used. The available head in this distance, based on levels taken by Mr. Morley, Superintendent of Works for the Department of Indian Affairs, is 414 feet, which would make the maximum carrying capacity of the pipe 275,000 Imperial gallons per day. A standard four inch Gate Valve should be installed in the pipe line near the intake to control the discharge.\n\n4. Concrete distributing tank, at the end of the four inch main, to take the place of the wooden tank previously described under \"Works\" and designated \"C\". By means of this tank the water supply may be permanently divided for three separate services:-\n(a) Domestic and Fire Protection\u2014Indian Boarding School.\n(b) Domestic\u2014Indian Village.\n(c) Irrigation\u2014Indian Boarding School.\n\nOn the accompanying plan it will be noted, from the relative positions of the two service pipes and spillway, that consideration has been given to the services in the order named. Should any temporary shortage occur, through obstructions at the intake or leakage in the main pipe line, the irrigation supply would first be affected, and in an emergency the school pipe would draw from the entire supply available.\n\nThe distributing tank should be so installed that the elevation of the spillway will be one foot below the top of the Wood Stave storage tank. By doing so the storage tank will be kept full (within one foot of the top) but will not overflow.\n\n5. Irrigation supply line from distributing tank to school land, consisting of approximately 2,500 feet of wood stave pipe, four inches in diameter. This pipe will have a fall of about 100 feet in 1000 feet and a capacity greater than that of the main supply line.\n\nA small concrete surge-tank should be installed at the end of this pipe line, and a flume to convey water for distribution on land.\n\n6. Domestic and fire protection line from distributing tank to school. At present the wood stave storage tank is fed by a wrought iron pipe, one and a half inches diameter, and is drained by a three inch wood stave pipe, reduced to one and a half inch wrought iron pipe. The rate of flow into the tank when empty is only 23 Imperial gallons per minute and the pipe, draining the tank, has a capacity of 42 gallons per minute.\nBy laying a three inch diameter W. I. pipe from the distributing tank to the storage tank, a distance of 100 feet, a continuous supply of 42 gallons per minute could be maintained indefinitely.\n\nIf it is desired to further increase the capacity of this line for the development of power for lighting purposes, a three inch diameter wood stave pipe continued to the school would deliver 145 gallons per minute. After deducting domestic requirements this quantity, under the available head of 290 feet, would develop eight and a half net horse-power on water-wheel at the school buildings.\n\nThe system would carry an adequate supply for a twenty-four hour day development during ten months of the year. During the remaining two months, July and August, a plant could operate eight hours during the night by drawing from the irrigation supply.\n\nRepairs to the village supply line can be made by removing damaged sections and replacing with newer pipe from the present two inch main from the springs.\n\nFollowing is an estimate of cost of proposed works by units:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Concrete Intake, installed                | $50.00 |\n| 4\" Gate Valve, installed                  | $35.00 |\n| Wood Stave Pipes, 4\" dia., 2000 ft. @ 38\u00a2 | $760.00|\n| Excavation & back-filling\u2014250 c.yds @ 1.00| $250.00 |\n| Freight & delivery of pipe onto ground    | $260.00 |\n| Laying Pipe                               | $50.00 |\n\nTotal: $1405.00\n\n2.

No.2.\n\nPoint of Diversion:- About one and a half mile from its mouth.\n\nQuantities applied for:- Irrigation: 20 ac. ft. for 15 acres of land on Seshekit I.R. No.2 adjoining Seshekit Indian Boarding School.\n\nDomestic:- 10,000 gallons per day throughout the year.\n\nAn objection to this application has been filed by H. Whitaker, who subsequently filed an application for a licence to divert water from the same source. It is probable that the Comptroller of Water Rights will hold a meeting to hear claims of the two parties in the near future.\nThe following plans accompany this report:\n\n1.

This report is supplementary to one on the same subject dated May 4, 1923, a copy of which was sent to you on May 17.\n\nYou will notice that the estimated cost of the proposed system is $9854, which includes an adequate domestic supply and fire protection for the Indian boarding school, a domestic supply for the Indian village and an irrigation system for the land adjacent to the boarding school.\n\nMr. Swan recommends that he be authorized to have the proposed work carried out on proven cost plus ten per cent basis. He states that this method of construction has been suggested by Mr. Orr and Mr. Ditchburn of your Department, and appears the most suitable under the circumstances.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. Challies\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 4, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nThe Sechelt Indian Residential School, in British Columbia, has lost during the past year or two some of its popularity with the Indian communities. Investigations have revealed the fact that a change in the management is desirable. The Sisters who have been in charge and the Provincial of the Oblate Order are agreed that the appointment of a resident priest as principal is desirable. Changes are being made in the instruction offered; and the institution is placed in the Industrial School class and will receive a larger per capita grant. The preparation of a larger garden is imperative and I shall be pleased to have your authority to allow a grant of $1,000 for clearing purposes. The work will be performed under the supervision of the Indian agent. A small boat with an engine is required for the supplying of fish, which are not to be found in the waters immediately in front of the school, and will be useful in the training of the older boys in the handling of marine boats and engines. It is estimated that $600 will secure suitable equipment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your authority to authorize this expense. Funds are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJanuary 9, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI have examined the letter of Mr. Inspector Cairns and yourself which recommends certain changes at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and I have also been in correspondence with the Sister Superior and the Very Rev. Father Weigh. I am pleased to inform you that arrangements have been made to allow a per capita grant of $170 for this institution. I have also arranged for the Oblate Fathers to assume the responsibility for the management, and the temporary appointment of Rev. Father Anthony Sadowski, O.M.I., has been approved.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase a small gasoline boat for the use of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. This equipment should be used not only for fishing activity but for the training of the boys. You should secure competitive prices from the best local sources of supply, and when presenting the voucher in favour of the firm given the business, you should support it with either an abstract of tender form or a complete explanation of the manner in which the business was awarded. Your estimate of $600 should be a guide to you in this connection.\n\nPlease arrange at an early date for clearing operations on land at the school which can be used later for gardening. You should secure as foreman for this work someone who is qualified to use a shovel, and you would be well advised to engage members of the Indian Band for the rough labour. If it is advisable to use the older boys at the school for some of this work, please instruct the foreman you engage to take precautionary measures to see that they receive no injury.\n\nYou may arrange for the rental of the 2-1/2 acres at Saycokas Reserve No. 3, which is owned by Dan Paul. The Department will allow a special grant of $25 per acre per annum for three years. You should secure the concurrence of the new Principal before making the arrangements for this land.\n\nI am instructing the new Principal to make organized efforts at vocational training for both the boys and girls, and you should give this your hearty support and cooperation upon the occasion of your visits to the Institution.\n\nI am sending Mr. Inspector Cairns a copy of this communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The work would consist principally in diverting the water from a stream in order to augment the flow of the existing spring, thus providing a combined flow of 250,000 gallons per day, which would represent an increase of 100,000 gallons over the quantity of water required for domestic and irrigation purposes. The present water pipe line would mostly have to be replaced by a new wood stave pipe of larger diameter provided with the necessary valves and other supply regulating appliances. New concrete intake and distributing tanks would have to be installed to replace the wooden ones, thus providing three separate services, one for domestic and fire protection of the Indian Boarding School, a second one for the water supply to the Indian Village, and a third one which would insure a reliable irrigation system for the land intended to be placed under cultivation at the Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn view of the location of the distributing tank and the pressure available sufficient power (6H.P.) would be developed during a period of ten months to provide for an electric lighting system at the school building. The estimated cost of the above mentioned work would amount to $9,854.00.\n\nBefore recommending the granting of such an expenditure I would suggest that Commissioner Ditchburn be requested to advise the Department whether the above mentioned improvements are absolutely necessary, also whether the present requirements of this institution warrant the immediate consideration of this proposal.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nREPORT\non\nTHE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\nat\nSECHELT, B.C.\nfor\nSECHELT INDIAN RESERVE NO.2\nand\nSECHELT INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nby\nM.

D. McLean in his letter to Mr. J. B. Challies dated 27th February, I beg to submit the following:\n\nAccompanied by Indian Agent C. C. Terry I proceeded to Sechelt on the 16th March and spent three days investigating the present system and source of supply, also the proposed extension of the present system to Wilson Creek.\n\nPresent Source of Supply.\n\nThe present supply is obtained from a small stream, which is probably fed by springs and surface water and is diverted at a point on Lot 2465 about two-and-a-half miles in a northeasterly direction from the Indian village. During ten months of the year an adequate supply is available to meet all requirements of the village and Indian Boarding School on the Reserve but during the remaining two months the quantity available is doubtful.\n\nAt the time of my visit fully one cubic foot per second was flowing to waste about half of which found its way to Porpoise Bay and the remainder was distributed over a swampy area near the intake, eventually seeping into the ground.\n\nIn contrast to the abundance of water at this season of the year Mr. Tebbes, Superintendent of Works at the School, informed me that during the dry season the quantity carried by the present pipe line amounted to only 17\u00bd gallons per minute by actual measurement. It is not known whether the total available flow during the dry period is carried by existing works or whether a portion of the flow is lost above the intake in the swampy ground. As this information is of prime importance in considering the adequacy of the present source of supply, a series of measurements should be made to determine the quantity of water available in the stream bed above the intake as compared with the quantity flowing through the system.\n\nThe watershed above the intake is timbered and has\nbeen cruised for timber quantities. Should this area be denuded of timber it is probable that the water supply would be affected to some extent during the dry period by increased evaporation.\n\nNo natural storage sites are known to be available but the possibilities would not be overlooked when a further examination of the creek is made during the dry season.\n\nPresent Supply System.\n\nAbout twenty-eight years ago the Indians constructed an open box flume from the present intake to a wooden tank or trough set in the ground at point \"C\" on sketch plan, a distance of approximately two miles. In 1910 this flume was replaced by a two-inch wood stave pipe which is now in use.\n\nFollowing is a detailed description of works with references to accompanying sketch.\n\nWORKS\n\n\"A\"...........Headworks consisting of a short length of flume with a crudely made screen of tin plate through which the water flows to a small wooden tank, thence into a two-inch wood stave pipe.\n\n\"A\" to \"B\"...Two-inch wood stave pipe approximately 8,000 feet in length with a fall of about 160 feet in this distance (or 22 feet in 1,000 feet).\n\n\"B\"...........Wooden trough sunk into ground with cover of loose planks, fitted with screen to arrest leaves and debris.\n\n\"B\" to \"C\"...Two inch wood stave pipe approximately 2,500 feet in length with fall of about 225 feet (or 87 feet in 1,000 ft).\n\n\"C\"...........Wooden trough or tank sunk into ground and covered by loose planks.\n\nNOTE: An iron Y connection is fitted to the two-inch wood stave supply pipe at this point to divide the flow between the Boarding School and the Indian Village. Two one-and-a-half inch wrought iron pipes are fitted to this connection, one discharges directly into the trough and the other is carried through the trough to discharge into the circular storage tank for the school supply.\n\n\"D\"...........Circular wood stave storage tank twelve feet in diameter ten feet high\u2014capacity 7,000 Imperial Gallons. This tank was so installed that the top would be at the same elevation as the water level in trough \"C\". By a simple adjustment of the Y, that is, by raising or lowering the short length of pipe which discharges into \"C\", the flow to the School or village may be increased or decreased as necessity may require.\n\n\"C\" to \"E\" to \"F\"...Two-inch wood stave pipe at present supplying Indian village through a number of half-inch iron stand pipes.\n\n\"D\" to \"E\"...Three-inch wood stave pipe, length 1750 feet.\nfall 214 feet (or 122.3 feet in 1,000 feet).\n\n\"E\" to \"G\".... Wrought iron pipe 1\u00bd\" diameter, length 1,000 feet to Indian Boarding School.\n\nThe building is equipped with four hydrants for fire protection, three of which are within the building. They are connected to a two-inch stand pipe and are fitted with 1\u00bd inch hose and connections with 3/8 inch nozzles.\n\nThe hydrant outside the building is not provided with hose.\n\nIt will be noted that the carrying capacity of the supply line is limited to the capacity of the first section of pipe from \"A\" to \"B\". This section is under a low head of 32 feet in 1,000 feet and is capable of delivering a maximum quantity of 26\u00bd Imperial gallons per minute or 28,160 gallons in twenty-four hours.\n\nWith certain exceptions the works appear to be in good condition and can be made to function properly if improvements are warranted by the available supply of water at the source.\n\nWater Requirements.\n\nThe heaviest demands upon the system unfortunately occur during the low water period so that requirements for both domestic and irrigation purposes must be considered, in addition to providing an emergency supply for fire protection.\n\nThe following figures are based on domestic requirements at 50 Imperial gallons per person per day and irrigation requirements at one acre foot per acre in sixty days which should be ample.\n\n| Domestic          | No. persons | Gallons per day |\n|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Boarding School   | 100         | 5,000           |\n| Indian Village    | 100         | 5,000           |\n| Irrigation Present acreage | 4 acres | 18,000          |\n\nTotal........... 28,000\n\nNo discharge data is available at the present time on which to determine the average quantity of water carried through the system during the dry period, but for the purpose of comparison I again quote Mr. Tebb's figures of 17\u00bd gallons per minute. This would give a flow of 25,500 gallons per day or very nearly the estimated requirements.\n\nThe domestic requirements amounting to 10,000 gallons would be drawn say within a period of twelve hours. It will therefore be apparent that irrigation, which is practised by a sprinkling system, must be carried on during the remaining twelve hours.\n\nFrom the foregoing it would appear that if the supply can be augmented by eliminating possible losses above the intake, there should be no shortage excepting that which is caused by waste.\nShortage in the past has been due, in part, to the unreasonable waste of water by Indians at the village who have a habit of allowing pipes to discharge freely into barrels for the purpose of soaking or cleaning fish, etc. This practice should be stopped at least during the period of low water. Another and most important cause of shortage is the extension of the pipe line from the Indian village to supply the Whitaker interests.\n\nThe extension of the pipe line was installed by Mr. Whitaker under a verbal agreement with the Indians, whereby Mr. Whitaker was permitted to obtain water from the system in consideration of the sum of $200.00 per annum, which was to be expended on the upkeep and maintenance of the Catholic church on the Indian reserve.\n\nThe Whitaker interests referred to, comprise a hotel and annex, general store, number of dwellings continuously occupied, and a number of cottages occupied during the summer season; at the present time 22 persons on the Sechelt Reserve depend on the system for domestic supply, and draw water from the extension installed by Mr. Whitaker.\n\nIt will thus be apparent that the total demands upon the system, under existing conditions, exceed the supply during the dry season and it will therefore be imperative that the supply to the Whitaker interests be cut off.\n\nApart from the consideration of shortage the unauthorized delivery of water to other than a licensee is illegal. Mr. Whitaker is not a licensee and the Department of Indian Affairs does not hold a license for conveying purpose consequently the delivery of water to Mr. Whitaker is an offence against the B.C. Water Act 1914. (See Section 47 sub-section 6)\n\nOn the other hand Mr. Whitaker has not been authorized, either by license or by the Department, to take water from the system, therefore diversion on his part is unlawful and he is liable to the penalty provided under Section 47, sub-section 2 of the Water Act.\n\nRecorded Rights.\n\nTwo records have been granted in favour of the Department authorizing diversion of water from the present source of supply:\n\nW.R.No.123\u2014dated 20th September, 1906\u201410 miners inches\n\nW.R.No.179\u2014dated 17th April, 1907\u2014\u2014-10 Miners inches\n\n(No water rights have been granted to other users).\n\nThese records were granted under the \"Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897\". Under Section 35 of this Act, the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council was necessary before a record could be authorized for the benefit of all or any Indians located on any Indian reserve in the Province.\n\nWater Record No.123 was confirmed by Order-in-Council in 1908 but W.R.No.179 has not been confirmed. The Board of Investigation has not yet adjudicated upon these records, although there is no doubt that a Conditional licence will be issued to supersede W.R.No.123 the status of W.R.179 is doubtful.\n\nIn any case the record dated 20th September, 1906, is sufficient to cover the present requirements, ten miners inches being equivalent to 150,000 gallons per day.\nThe storage tank described under \"Works\" and designated \"D\" was intended to provide an emergency supply for fire protection. On inspection the tank was found to contain about 2\u00bd feet of water and I was informed that the tank had never been filled, though filled varying from about one to three feet. I adjusted the \"Y\" connection at \"C\" so that the tank filled to within three inches of the top in less than four hours. The tank when full automatically shuts off the inflow as the top of the tank is the same elevation as the water in trough \"G\". As the water level in the tank is drawn down the difference in elevation between \"C\" and \"D\" is increased so that with an empty tank the inflow would be greatest, gradually decreasing as the tank fills. It follows that when the tank is full the whole flow from the main supply pipe is available for use in the village.\n\nThe present adjustment of the \"Y\" should work satisfactorily, and will ensure a reserve supply of 7,000 Imperial gallons for the school without affecting the village supply to any appreciable extent.\n\nThe pipe from the tank to the school is capable of delivering about forty-two Imperial gallons per minute so that with an average inflow of say ten gallons per minute while the tank is emptying, the reserve supply (during the dry period) should last 3\u00bd hours in an emergency.\n\nWilson Creek.\n\nThis stream carries an abundant supply of water during the low-water period and would be a most desirable source of supply if a system could be installed at reasonable cost.\n\nMany years ago, the Indians constructed a flume and ditch line from Wilson Creek to the reserve but failed to get water on account of seepage losses in porous ground. Parts of the old ditch were inspected, also sections of flume built of hollowed cedar which bear evidence of the industry of a past generation. The route of this old ditch lies along steep and heavily timbered side-hill and probably follows the best location obtainable (although no levels were taken) but since it was built two deep gulches have been formed by washouts which would materially add to the cost of a new system.\n\nHeadworks would have to be substantially built to obtain water at the lowest stage of the stream and withstand the pressure of high water. Both above and below the location of the old Indian intake the creek flows through a rock canyon, deep and narrow in places, with wider stretches strewn with large boulders. The nature of headworks required and the cost of constructing same could only be determined after making a detailed survey. That is to say, the type of dam would depend on the nature and contour of the...\nstream-bed and banks at the particular site selected for construction, and this could only be determined after running a grade line for the system.\n\nThe lack of transportation facilities for delivering materials and supplies onto the ground would also add considerably to the cost of the proposed scheme.\n\nFrom the foregoing examination we would estimate the cost of constructing a system from Wilson Creek, including concrete dam and headworks, the laying of a six-inch wood stave pipe, treestling over gulches etc., at from $12,000.00 to $15,000.00. This estimate might be reduced according to the suitability of the dam-site and any natural advantages which might be presented should a more detailed investigation be made.\n\nA survey of a proposed water supply system from Wilson Creek was made in 1914 by Messrs. Cleveland and Cameron (consulting engineers) for the Canadian European Investment Company. Notes and plans of this survey are now in possession of Messrs. Heming & Horie, Consulting Engineers, 106 London Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Canadian European Investment Company was composed principally of Germans and, after the outbreak of war, their interests reverted to the Whiteaker interests of Sechelt.\n\nA project from Wilson Creek to supply the combined interests of the Sechelt townsite, Sechelt Indian Reserve, Union Steamship Company and smaller private interests has been mooted for some time. As Mr. Whiteaker is perhaps the most vitally interested, and as he has complained of the inadequacy of the Indian system and source of supply, the Department might be well advised to allow him to take the initiative in providing plans and estimates or costs of the proposed system. The Department could then accept or reject any offer for delivery of water on its merits. In other words, it would devolve upon Mr. Whiteaker to offer the Department something better than it now has installed.\n\nConclusions.\n\n(1)- The source of supply now used is adequate to meet the requirements of the Indians of Sechelt Indian Reserve No.8 and the Sechelt Indian Boarding School for ten months in the year. During the remaining two months the supply does not fall far short of present demands and it is considered possible to sufficiently augment the flow so as to provide an adequate supply throughout the year.\n\n(2)- In order that the Indians and the Boarding School should enjoy the benefit of recorded rights, from a source that is barely sufficient for their needs, the unlawful diversion of water from this system should be stopped.\n\n(3)- Owing to the heavy cost of constructing a system from Wilson Creek the Department would be well advised to withhold consideration of the project until the adequacy of the present source of supply, during the dry season, is determined.\nRecommendations.\n\n(1) That the supply of water from the present system to the Whitaker interests be cut off before June 15th.\n\n(2) That a further examination of the source of supply be made during the dry period with the view of eliminating possible losses or augmenting the supply by storage or diversion from any other source which may be found to be available.\n\n(3) That in the meantime no action be taken with regard to the Wilson Creek project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M.

It would be inadvisable to place the hose there at the present time, as the water pressure would be insufficient to make use of it, in addition to the equipment already there. We will, however, report on this matter at a later date, and make such recommendations as are deemed advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nSir:\n\nUpon the request of this Department a report has been prepared by the Dominion Water Power Branch of Vancouver, in connection with the proposed addition to the present water supply system at Sechelt B.C. According to this report the estimated cost of the work as projected would amount to $9,654.00 approximately.\n\nAs I understand that the water supply now available for both the Indian Boarding School and the Village of Sechelt is quite satisfactory I have to request that you personally investigate this question and advise me whether the Department would be justified in taking into consideration, at the present time, the making of such an expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You may engage white labour for blasting at Sechelt School. Do not award contract. Purchase necessary material yourself and engage foreman and other labour by the day.\"\n\nIt was considered that it would be more satisfactory to have this work done by day labour, and as you stated that Indian labour was unsatisfactory, the Department therefore approved of white labour only being employed under the charge of a competent foreman. It will be necessary for you to keep time sheets, in duplicate, of the labour employed. These sheets should contain the name of the foreman, as well as the names of the men employed, also the hours worked and the salary paid, and should be signed by the individual men employed, and forwarded to the Department for payment. You, yourself, should arrange for the purchase of any materials required. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred in the purchase of the materials, or in the labour employed in the clearing of the land which is to be used for gardening purposes. Competitive prices should be obtained before purchasing materials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C.

McLennan, McFeely & Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Marshall Wells, B.C. Ltd., for land clearing and blasting materials furnished for the clearing of the Indian Reserve land around the Sechelt Indian Residential School as authorized by the Department, together with an abstract of tenders in the same connection. I would inform you that the land has been cleared and burned for about two acres up to the present date and that it is hoped to have a considerable area in actual use very soon. I would recommend payment of this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSIR:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st February in which you refer to the installation of an extensive water system for the Sechelt Indian School as proposed by the Engineers of the Dominion Water Power Branch, at Vancouver, at an estimated cost of $9,854.00, I beg to say that the scheme as suggested by Assistant Engineer Balls is to provide a greater supply for domestic purposes as well as for irrigation, if necessary, of fifteen acres of land for garden purposes.\n\nAs this area has not yet been cleared of the timber and stumps it has not been ascertained as to whether the land will have to be irrigated, though it has generally been thought it will owing to land in the vicinity being of a dry sandy character, capable of cultivation if watered for at least two months in the summer. The fifteen acres spoken of cannot, however, be cultivated during the coming season and it would, therefore, be advisable that the proposed enlargement of the present supply be held over till next year, when the Department will be in a better position to know just how much water is needed.\n\nWHD,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I beg to say that there were several responses and I have numerous offers, but in consequence of Dominion Constable Bartlett (who is also an engineer) being called away on smallpox quarantine and other important Agency business and also on account of the temporary illness of the Reverend Father Swenceski, the newly appointed principal of the school, whose time has been greatly absorbed also in attending to the many duties on assuming the Principalship of the school, the purchase of a boat has been somewhat delayed and it has been arranged with Rev. Father Swenceski that the boat offered for sale and possibly some others will be carefully examined as soon as Constable Bartlett returns.

McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMassey-Harris Grub Breaker\n\nThe Massey-Harris 22-inch Grub Breaker is built for Horse or Engine plowing in extra heavy, rooty land. It will cut through any size roots likely to be encountered, and has done good work in reclaiming land that was untillable owing to the tangled growth of scrub and young trees.\n\nThe construction is very strong throughout as will be seen from the illustration. Beam is re-inforced with Steel Straps both top and bottom, and is further strengthened by the Plate of Steel on the right hand side at the Standard. Standard is mortised into the Beam. Board and Share are Solid Steel, not too highly tempered so as not to break. Runner on land side of Beam protects when transporting.\n\nCoulter being fitted onto the Nose of the Share acts as a further brace between Plow Bottom and Beam, and also saves the point of Share from catching in or under anything. If the Coulter should be found to be leading the Plow, which fact is indicated by Plow winging over or climbing, then wedge the Coulter to or from the land as the case may be. This is worth knowing. The Heel Piece on the landside serves to keep the Plow away from wall of furrow and thus reduce landside friction.\n\nThe Improved Forecarriage ensures steady running and makes plowing easy. It is all Steel; Wheels have 3-inch Tires and Dust-Proof Bearings.\n\nThe two Steel Levers regulate the depth, level the Plow, and raise it from the ground.\n\nShipped as illustrated, with two Steel Wrenches.\n\nA Great Plow for Cleaning Bush or Rooty Land.\nI beg to inform you that during a recent visit to the Sechelt Indian Boarding School, for the purpose of inspecting the blasting and clearing of an additional area to the cultivable area of the school property, I found that three and a half acres of land had been blasted of all stumps and cleared sufficiently to admit of the use of a strong plough for purposes of breaking the said area. The principal, Rev. Father A. Swenceski, furnished me with page No. 69, of the Massey Harris Company's Implement catalog, upon which is illustrated the Massey Harris grub breaker, which he has found in his considerable experience to be of great advantage in bringing the area referred to into condition for working during the present season. It is likely that potatoes will be planted for the first season on some portion and clover on another portion.\n\nI have telephoned to the Massey Harris Company and have ascertained that the price of this implement will be $131.00, delivered at Sechelt. I am submitting herewith the catalog page referred to. The Reverend Principal has asked me to request the Department to be good enough to supply this plough for the benefit of the Sechelt School, and he states that this plough in particular has been selected by him as being likely to do more work than the ordinary furrow plough, as it is possible that in the future additional areas of new land may be cleared and this style of plough is considered more efficacious in dealing with land in which there is a great deal of brush and roots, as is the case at Sechelt.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. Se-105 of the 16th instant, being a request for authority to purchase a plough to be used as a grub breaker on the land that is being cleared at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. Favourable consideration has been given and you may incur an expenditure of approximately $130 in the purchase of a suitable plough. If several manufacturers carry equipment of this kind you should secure competitive prices, and, when submitting the properly certified account in duplicate, support it with an Abstract of Tender form. However, if it is considered that no plough other than the Massey-Harris land grub breaker is suitable for the purpose, you may give the order, and, when submitting the account, support it with a letter of explanation as to why it was not advisable to call for prices in the regular way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have pleasure in informing the Department that about three and a half acres of land that will be good when irrigated have been cleared in the immediate vicinity of the school, some of which is being put under cultivation immediately and will relieve the Department of the necessity of leasing a portion of the No.3 Reserve in Torpoise Bay from Indian Dan Paul, which action had been contemplated and which was authorized by the Department. In discussing this matter with the principal, Rev. Father Swenceaski, it was agreed that the leasing of Dan Paul's improvements would not now be necessary. The Department will be aware that it was decided to spend the sum of $1000.00 in the clearing of additional land. The cost of labour to date has been $714.75 and tools, explosives, wharfage, freight and sundries total $211.82, making in all $926.57.\n\nIn view of the fact that a plough has been requisitioned which will cost in the neighbourhood of $100 or more dollars, I have stopped work on this project, for the time being. I think it would be advisable, however, to carry out more blasting and clearing in the near future. The area set apart for the school grounds is, I understand fifteen acres and the greater part of this area is under wood; the timber therein being suitable for school fuel and not strictly merchantable in character.\n\nVery appreciable strides have been taken in the matter of improvements in the grounds surrounding the school. The Reverend Principal, and his able staff having done a great deal of valuable work such as fencing.\nMay 19, 1924.\n\nfencing, poultry rearing, garden and other improvements of a general nature, and that part of the school layout is showing commendable improvement.\n\nI would recommend payment of the enclosed Voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.C.

In my letter of 19th of May, to the Department, I stated that I had stopped work on that project for the time being. At that time the labour for the week ended May 3rd was outstanding and held temporarily in abeyance owing to our supply of Labour Return forms having run out, making it necessary to requisition further forms which have since been received from the Department. I would inform you that there are no further accounts in this connection outstanding and I would recommend payment in this instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C.

The cost of this puller which is sold by Mark Dumond, Wholesale and Retail Hardware dealer at Vancouver, is $218.10.\n\nIn this connection the Department will be aware that an additional area to the cultivable land surrounding the school was cleared during the spring of the present year. One and a half acres of this land is being placed under immediate cultivation and it was expected when the blasting was completed that the stumps covering an additional two acres which had been blasted but not cleared could be removed by means of a horse team. While a large number of the broken stumps have been removed with the school tools there are numerous stumps on this plot which cannot be removed by the horses, but which would have to be pulled out with a stump puller or else blasted again. The Reverend Principal states that if he is supplied with a stump puller he will be able to remove the present obstructions as well as having the machine for the clearing of further areas within the fifteen acre school grounds as time goes on.\n\nI am in accord with the views of the Reverend Principal and would recommend that if the Department is able to do so this school be provided with a suitable stump puller, preferably the one which has been selected by the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Ferry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 8, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nYou will remember that clearing land for garden purposes was one of the activities undertaken at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, in an effort to better conditions at that institution. $1000, which was the amount authorized for clearing, stumping and breaking, has been expended. Mr. Indian Agent Perry now recommends that the school be supplied with a stump puller, so that the management from time to time can proceed with more clearing. The estimated cost of suitable equipment is $220 and I wish to recommend that the request be granted.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. S E 108 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the purchase of a stump puller for the Saghalit Indian Residential School.

When you are submitting the certified account in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, you should support it with a statement showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nWhen you are informing the principal of this grant, you should explain to him that the Department will expect him to continue clearing the land from time to time, without further assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In view of the foregoing and in view of the fact that the stump pullers offered by the other firms at a cheaper price were not of the type desired for this school, also in view of the fact that the remarks column in the sample copy of tender abstract prepared for the guidance of those making purchases for the Department makes provision for a remark \"Not Government Grade\" where the officer considers such remark to be necessary, I assumed that it would be sufficient for me to make note in the remarks column concerning the purchase of this stump puller to the effect that the stump pullers not chosen were not of Government grade. I trust that this explanation will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nThe machine has been in use since delivery and is giving splendid satisfaction. I am satisfied that the machine selected at $216.00 is of better value than the other machines which were offered and I used my discretion in the matter of this purchase and I trust not contrarily to the rules of the Department. The voucher in question, with abstract of tenders is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C.

I presently renew this demand and ask that an item be enclosed in the estimates for such purpose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSechelt Indian School\nSechelt B.C.\nNov. 6th 1924\n\nMr. W. B. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour of 5th inst. No. 1813948 is here.\n\nAt present our stock consists of four cows, one bull and two horses, besides a calf. I am storing up seventy-five tons of feed for the year\u2014twenty-five tons of hay and fifty tons of salt grass for the barn. By doing this, my freight is reduced to half.\n\nI intend to increase my stock by six cows in order to be able to supply butter and a great deal of meat by ranch sales. I shall be in a position to do this shortly, as I am ploughing a new acre of land in a few days, and two more acres will be most likely under cultivation early in spring. This will furnish sufficient supply for the barn. I feel that I must have recourse to some means of reducing the high freight rates on our supplies. Hence, the necessity of increasing our stock. As time goes on, I shall clear more land.\n\nTherefore, from the above, I do not think the size of the barn I requested is by any means too large. Implement also should appear, be held at present, two ploughs, one double harrow, a stump puller with cables, and a drag saw.\n\nTrusting the above will be satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\nSincerely Yours,\n\nA.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., November 21st, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th ultimo referring further to the question of building a barn for the Sechelt School, I beg to say that I took up the points of your letter with the Reverend Principal of the School, and I am now in receipt of a reply from him which is attached hereto for your information.\n\nIn view of the representations made by the Principal I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to have this barn constructed of the size and kind proposed by Mr. Tabb, plans of which you already have.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nR.

He was also asked to furnish a rough sketch showing the size and style of buildings recommended.\n\nIn September a letter was received from Commissioner Ditchburn enclosing the information asked for and advising that the Reverend Principal would undertake the erection of the buildings, as suggested. On examining the sketches, however, it appeared to me that they were asking for more accommodation than was necessary from what I had seen on my visit there last year. I therefore wrote to Mr. Ditchburn for more information and have today received a letter which fully explains the accommodation asked for, and it would appear that a big improvement has taken place at the Seehelt School since the Reverend Father Sylvester has taken charge.\n\nThe cost of the barn and store house required will be well under the amount provided in the estimates. I am of the opinion that the same can be built for approximately $3,500.\n\nI beg to recommend that Mr. Ditchburn be authorized to proceed with this work.\n\nARCHITECT.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th of September, file No. 15-3630 and your letter of the 21st instant regarding the building of a barn and storehouse for the Sechelt School, I beg to say that the Department approves of the carrying out of this work in accordance with the sketch submitted with your letter of the 24th of September, and I would ask you to please purchase all the materials required in the regular way.\n\nIt is noted with reference to the labour that the Principal agrees to be responsible for all of the labour with the exception of one carpenter who will be paid by the Department. An accountable cheque for the payment of labour performed by this carpenter will be sent you on application, and time sheets should be kept by the Principal showing the number of hours he works, and these should be forwarded to the Department when submitting the vouchers.\n\nI am returning herewith the sketch and bill of material which you asked to have returned. Please see that the expenditure is kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Maclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.

C. Perry,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince I came here I found it necessary to make certain purchases to enable me to carry on the work about the school satisfactorily.\n\nI bought a truck for $38.00 to haul wood for the school. But owing to the sandy nature of the roads, the work was too heavy for our horse. So I bought another horse for $8.00 to meet the one already here.\n\nI bought a bull for $28.00, so the nearest one was at Nelson's Landing, some twenty miles away. As time went on I noticed that the demand for wood at the school was greater than the supply. So I bought a good smooth-hand wood sawing outfit for $300.00. It has been used to a great advantage ever since.\n\nI have cleared an acre of new land. And after having staked it, the land required discing, so I bought a disc for $75.00. The disc harrow will be tried on other fields that I shall clear in time.\n\nI bought faulty netting for $6.15 to fence the cleared acre. The field will serve as a faulty yard when the crop will be taken in.\n\nThe whole of the above amounts to $725.15.\n\nI have no doubt at all that the Department will approve of the above purchases.\n\nI beg you, therefore, to kindly submit these with attached vouchers, to the Department for their kind approval.\nand refund the school for the purchase that I have made.\n\nI have taken a great interest in this school and everything that pertains to it.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith a letter received from Rev. Father Anthony Swenceski, Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, which will be self-explanatory, the same being a request that the Department make payment to cover the purchases made in connection with the school, by the Reverend Father, as follows:\n\nMar. 5, 1924.

You will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 404, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, February 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Perry has forwarded from the Rev. Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School six receipts showing expenditure which has been undertaken, as far as I am aware, without authority. I am writing to learn if you have been consulted in connection with any of the purchases.\n\nIn March, last, a mare and purebred bull were purchased. A year ago a wheel truck was secured. In the fall there was purchased an engine and pole saw outfit, a disc harrow and some poultry netting. Funds are extremely limited at this time, and unless you can throw light on these purchases, the Department will have to refuse payment to the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in which you state that Indian Agent Jerry has forwarded to you six receipts showing expenditure which has been undertaken by the Rev. Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and you wish to know whether I have been consulted in connection with any of the purchases.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have no knowledge of these purchases as the matter was never taken up with me either by the Department, the Agent or the Principal.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nF. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 13, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 12th ultimo, enclosing six vouchers in favour of the Rev. Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. There was no authority given in connection with these payments, and, as our funds are extremely limited at the present time, favourable consideration cannot be given. Please inform the Rev. Principal and also indicate to him the proper procedure before incurring expenditures which he expects the Department to meet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I think that a pipe line connected from the nearest point in the orchard would solve the difficulty.\n\nSo will you be good enough to request the Department to grant me 250 feet of 1\u00bd inch or galvanized pipe with two ft. I shall be glad to put in the pipe myself.\n\nLively Yours,\n\nFather Anthony\n\nSekelt B.C.\nAt Vancouver Agency, Vancouver, B.C.,\n\nApril 15, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith a letter dated March 18th, received from Rev. Father Anthony Swenceski, principal of the Sechelt Indian residential School, in which he makes application for two hundred and forty feet of one and one-half inch galvanized pipe and two T's, for purposes of irrigation.\n\nI would inform you that I submitted this matter to the Indian Commissioner at Victoria, as it was understood that some consideration was being given to an additional water supply for the Sechelt Reserve, but as a further investigation of the water situation at Sechelt is pending and it will be necessary to take further records during the dry season of the approaching summer, Commissioner Ditchburn suggests that this application be forwarded to the Department with a recommendation for favourable consideration, as this supply will be of considerable value for present irrigation purposes.\n\nI would recommend that approval be given to this purchase and would inform you that the cost has been ascertained to be approximately $27.24 for one hundred feet of pipe and $1.00 each for the T's, with a discount for cash.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.G.

Hammond, of Sechelt, B.C., amounting to $650.00 for a gasoline launch (described on the face of the account) purchased by me for the Sechelt Indian Residential School, under authority of Departmental Letter No.167-18-I, dated January 9th, 1924.\n\nAccompanying the voucher is an Abstract of Tender.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to report that the purchase was not made sooner as the Principal of the School was not ready to receive the boat on account of the many improvements of greater importance to the School upon which the Principal and staff have deemed it advisable to concentrate. Moreover, we have been on the lookout for a suitable boat and have seen a considerable number but we have not been able to find, until now, a boat that would be suitable for the purposes desired, the sum of approximately $600 being low for a complete boat ready for sea.\n\nThe boat has been purchased after conferring with Mr. H. H. Cairns, Inspector of Schools, the Principal\u2014Rev. Father Swinecki, Mr. Dominion Constable Bartlett (who is also engineer of the Department's launch) and others. We are satisfied that this boat is a good buy at the price and the Principal is well satisfied with the vessel after giving it a good trial.\n\nI would recommend that the account be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver Agency, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nIndian Commissioner's Office for Vancouver AGENCY.\n\nTo A.

De La A.\nKelvinator\nand Kelvinated foods\n\nFor Convenience Economy and Health\nKELVINATOR\nELECTRIC REFRIGERATION\n\nKelvinator is an appliance for chilling home refrigerators electrically. It can be installed in any good refrigerator, and will keep it at a much lower temperature than ice will. It requires no attention. Once installed Kelvinator operates automatically, doing away entirely with the daily attention demanded when ice is used.\n\nKelvinator is the oldest existing system of domestic electric refrigeration and is a time-tried product. Installations made years ago are still working as efficiently as ever.\n\nIMPROVED Refrigeration\u2014Not a Mere Substitute for Ice\n\nWhile Kelvinator takes the place of ice in the refrigerator, it should not be regarded as an ice substitute. It is a new method entirely, as great an improvement over older methods as the vacuum cleaner over the broom.\n\nKelvinator chilled refrigerators are much colder than ice-cooled ones; foods stay fresh for days, not merely for a few hours; the refrigerator never gets musty; the interior is full of dry cold air.\n\nKelvinator really refrigerates, and true refrigeration has many characteristics hitherto unknown to the home.\nWhat Is Kelvinator\u2014How Does It Work?\n\nKelvinator consists of two parts: first, the freezing unit that goes into the compartment ordinarily used for ice; and second, a mechanical unit, usually placed in the basement, that extracts the heat from the refrigerator and thus leaves it cold.\n\nThe freezing unit is shown in the above illustration. This is made in sizes for any refrigerator. When Kelvinator is in operation this unit gets so cold it becomes thickly coated with frost. It stays that cold, and maintains a very low refrigerator temperature.\n\nThe trays of the freezing unit are used for freezing crystal-like cubes of pure ice for table use, or a large number of frozen desserts, salads and other dainties. Kelvinator furnishes a recipe book for making these things.\n\nThe mechanical unit that 'furnishes cold' to the freezing unit is shown below. This is usually placed in the basement or in any other convenient place. It may also be installed on top, below or at the side of the refrigerator according to space available.\n\nThis part is connected to the freezing unit in the refrigerator by two small pipes. A simple electrical connection furnishes power. Once the installation is made and the current turned on, you simply forget refrigeration. It stays cold without attention\u2014colder than you ever imagined a refrigerator could be.\n\nThe Zone of Kelvination\u2014Where Foods Stay Fresh for Days\n\nIt is a strange fact that at temperatures of from 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 the bacteria in foods multiply only about 1/400 as rapidly as in corresponding temperatures from 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Below 50\u00b0 deterioration practically stops.\n\nKelvinator can, and does, maintain temperatures constantly below this danger line. Ice does not. For this reason the ideal range of temperature\u2014from 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0\u2014is called the Zone of Kelvination. Foods placed in this Zone stay fresh for days.\n\nThe atmosphere of the Zone of Kelvination is not moist and clammy as is ice-cooled air. It is dry and actually frosty. It has the same crisp \"sting\" as the air on a frosty night. There is a reason for this.\n\nRemember that the freezing unit is many degrees colder than ice. It is so cold that the moisture crystallizes on it, and it soon becomes thickly coated with pure, white frost.\n\nHow Foods Improve in the Zone of Kelvination\n\nThe cold, frosty air of the Zone of Kelvination does far more than merely \"keep\" foods. It actually improves them.\n\nTake, for example, green vegetables such as are used for salads. When they come from the market they are seldom as crisp and inviting as when fresh from the garden. But put them for\na few hours in the frosty Zone of Kelvination and they \"crisp up\" until they almost fall apart at the touch of a fork.\n\nTake meats. Everybody knows that the thick steaks served in the best hotels and restaurants have a tenderness and flavor that the housewife seldom duplicates. Make use of the Zone of Kelvination and you can serve steaks just as delicious.\n\nTry it. Keep your meats for a few days in a Kelvinator-chilled refrigerator and they will acquire that same delicious tenderness and flavor. The frosty air removes all objectionable animal taste and gives meats a flavorful mellowness totally different from meats direct from the market.\n\n**KELVINATOR-Chilled Refrigerators Are Always Fresh and Clean**\n\nKelvinator is a joy to the careful housewife because mustiness never develops. It is moisture that causes this mustiness, and since Kelvinated air is dry air it prevents the unsanitary conditions caused by dampness.\n\nKelvinator-chilled refrigerators always have a clean, cold interior with the same frosty snap you have often noticed on clear autumn nights. The owner of such a refrigerator is always proud to show it.\n\n**Kelvinator Makes You Independent of Ice Delivery**\n\nEven if Kelvinator required the same care as ice, you would like it for its superiority, but when you consider that it relieves you of all the annoyance of ice-handling it is twice as desirable.\n\nKelvinator refrigerates for months or years with practically no attention. You need never worry about ice melting over Sunday. You need not inconvenience yourself by waiting for the ice man before you can go calling or shopping. Mud or snow will never be tracked over your clean floors.\n\nIn short, your refrigerator will become as free from care or trouble as any article of furniture. You will accept refrigeration as naturally as the presence of a built-in cupboard.\n\n**Market Only Once a Week\u2014Forget Daily Trips to the Store**\n\nWhen you have Kelvinator you can buy foods for a week in advance. Put them in the Zone of Kelvination and you will be prepared for any emergency. Unexpected guests will cause you no embarrassment.\n\nHaving the Zone of Kelvination in your home is just as convenient as having a complete store, once it is well stocked with provisions.\n\n**With Children in the Home Kelvinator Is A Real Necessity**\n\nWhere there's a baby to look after, Kelvinator relieves mother of endless work and worry. The delicate foods that must be prepared so care-\nKelvinator Freezes New and Novel Kelvinated Desserts or Dainty Cubes of Pure Ice for the Table\n\nEach Kelvinator freezing unit contains one or more removable trays. These trays are for the purpose of freezing cubes of ice for the table or preparing frozen desserts, salads and other dainties. If you fill these trays with your favorite table water and set them in place for a few hours, the result is crystal-clear cubes of ice for chilling beverages or similar uses. If you color the water, the ice cubes will be beautiful and decorative. Thus while Kelvinator relieves you of the cares of ice delivery it provides you with ice in its purest and most attractive form.\n\nFruit juices, creams and other special preparations frozen in the trays make sherbets, ices and other dainties. Colorful frozen salads can be made in the same way. To prepare these frozen dainties with Kelvinator you do not have to work with cracked ice and salt; you merely put the material in the trays and forget them for a few hours. Among the Kelvinated delicacies are ices, frappes, sherbets, mousses, chilled fruits, frozen custards, puddings, salads and many others. They are so numerous that a special book has been compiled on their preparation\u2014the \"Kelvinator Book of Delicacies.\" A copy of this book may be obtained from any Kelvinator dealer.\n\nOne important fact should be noted in regard to the process of Kelvination as compared with freezing with ice\u2014Kelvinated products are pure. There is no chance of contamination from ice from an unknown source. Ice frozen by Kelvinator is as pure as table water, and Kelvinated delicacies are equally wholesome.\n\nThe process of freezing requires little attention. After the water, fruit juice, salad or other material is placed in the tray, you simply forget it until you are ready to serve it. Many find it convenient to fill the trays and leave them overnight.\nfully can then be prepared for twenty-four-hour periods instead of half-a-dozen times a day. Kelvinator will keep them safe.\n\nWith older children it is easy to keep on hand the many special articles of diet upon which their health depends. It is not difficult to put them on a diet that is both scientific and tempting, for Kelvinator puts at your call any article of food required.\n\nWhen Kelvinator Is Truly a Life-Saver\n\nKelvinator is a necessity to the family in health, but when sickness comes it is even more\u2014it is a vital aid to recovery.\n\nNothing is more important in cases of sickness than diet. With Kelvinator you can not only keep on hand articles of food that are demanded, but you can also prepare an endless variety of dainties to tempt dormant appetites. Such cases are, of course, emergencies, but the wise housewife is never caught unprepared.\n\nWhen Mother Goes Visiting For a Few Days\n\nUsually when the mother in a household goes away even for a day or two there is consternation among the rest of the family. The corner restaurant acquires new but unwilling patrons. Kelvinator changes it all.\n\nA cold roast, a few vegetables and a salad prepared in advance, and the problem is solved. Husband or children will be well provided for.\n\nThe Cost of Kelvinator's Convenience Is Very Low\n\nAfter reading of Kelvinator's desirable advantages you will naturally wonder if the cost of such convenience is not unreasonably high. It is not. As a matter of fact, Kelvinator is an economy as well as a convenience.\n\nThere are two reasons for this. First, it costs less to chill a good refrigerator with Kelvinator than it does to keep it supplied with ice. This has been demonstrated in The Priscilla Proving Plant\u2014a modern kitchen conducted by Modern Priscilla Magazine. Their endorsement is printed herewith. Following their test they made this statement:\n\n\"Any device which decreases the problems of the home-maker is enthusiastically endorsed by staff members. It is a pleasure to add Kelvinator to the list of products tested and approved by the Priscilla Proving Plant.\"\nThe second reason for Kelvinator economy is that it saves more than it costs. The elimination of wasted food due to deterioration and the economies made possible by buying in larger quantities more than pays for Kelvinator and its operation.\n\nKelvinator Cold Is Constant\u2014It Never Varies\n\nOne great disadvantage of ice is that it may chill the refrigerator while there is a plentiful supply, but as it melts the temperature rises far above the danger point.\n\nKelvinator keeps the refrigerator cold all the time. An automatic regulator stops the system when the refrigerator is cold enough, but when the temperature rises slightly it starts again.\n\nThis uniform cold is more important than intense cold. It is not enough that a refrigerator be cold part of the time; it must be cold all the time or the food it contains deteriorates. Kelvinator maintains a condition of dry cold all the time.\n\nHow Kelvinator Refrigerates\n\nThe principle employed by Kelvinator in chilling a refrigerator is based on the fact that\n\nGreen\u2014Liquid\nRed\u2014Semi-Liquid and Gas\nBlue\u2014Gas\nYellow\u2014Compressed Gas\n\na large quantity of heat is absorbed by a substance when it passes from a liquid to a gaseous state. Sulphur dioxide liquid is used because at atmospheric pressure it absorbs heat from its surroundings, or from a refrigerator, at a very low level of temperature, and in so doing changes into a gas.\nThe Kelvinator compressor takes this heat-laden gas at a low temperature level and compresses it to a high temperature level, so that the heat removed from the refrigerator may be dissipated into the air of the room. In giving up its heat to the air, the gas again changes into liquid, under pressure, so that the same sulphur dioxide is used over and over again.\n\nReferring to the diagram above, the Kelvinator compressor draws sulphur dioxide gas from the gas line, compresses it, and delivers it to the condenser as shown in yellow. As the gas gives up its heat to the surrounding air, it becomes a liquid under pressure as shown in green. This liquid is piped to a carefully regulated expansion valve where its pressure is released before entering the coils of the freezing unit. The liquid now under reduced pressure absorbs heat from the brine in the tank as it changes back into a gas again. As heat is removed from the brine, it naturally becomes very cold and it in turn extracts heat from the metal freezing unit which acts as a cake of ice that never melts. The heat-laden sulphur dioxide gas is then drawn back to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.\n\nThe process is entirely automatic, the apparatus requires no attention and the temperature remains constantly cold indefinitely.\n\nKELVINATOR CORPORATION\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nThe Oldest Electric Refrigeration for the Home\n\nKelvinator is the pioneer successful system of electric refrigeration for the home. It was a fully proven success before any other existing system was even on the market.\n\nThe Kelvinator installations made from five to ten years ago are still operating as efficiently as ever. These early installations demonstrate that Kelvinator has been a fully perfected product for years, and can be purchased with complete confidence.\nThe KELVIN-ET\n\nThe Kelvin-ET combines both Kelvinator and refrigerator in one compact unit. It is delivered to your home and set in place as easily as an ordinary refrigerator. A single electric connection is the only installation required.\n\nKelvinator manufactures electric ice cream cabinets in sizes suitable for every retail business. Information on request.\n\nCopyright Kelvinator Corporation\n\n1925\nA Wonderful Aid in Entertaining\n\nDelicious new frozen desserts\u2014ices, creams, sherbets, frozen puddings\u2014are made easily and quickly in the Frigidaire trays. They can be prepared in a few hours and are always ready for serving upon any occasion. With Frigidaire, you can be ready in advance for the unexpected guest, serving at a moment's notice wonderful desserts, or salads of a new delicacy and freshness.\n\nSuperior flavor and freshness will not be limited to salad or dessert. The perfectly chilled fruit from Frigidaire will be a revelation to you. Celery, lettuce and other vegetables can be served as fresh as the day they came from the garden. Meats can be kept four or five times as long and in much better condition than with ice.\n\nYou will find Frigidaire to be a year-round utility, quickly taking its place as the most prized of modern conveniences in your home.\nBetter Kept Food Means Better Health\n\nFRIGIDAIRE is the automatic, electric refrigerator that operates from ordinary home electric current. It creates a constant dry cold that is always twelve degrees colder than would be maintained with ice.\n\nAlmost every other household utility has been modernized from time to time, but Frigidaire is the greatest improvement made in home refrigeration in fifty years.\n\nThe constant low temperature maintained by Frigidaire protects the health of the family by preventing food from getting into that very dangerous state when neither taste nor smell can tell that it is unsafe to eat.\n\nNote what this recent Bulletin from the United States Department of Agriculture says: \"At a temperature below fifty degrees Fahrenheit, bacteria multiply less rapidly, but between fifty degrees and one hundred degrees Fahrenheit the increase is very fast. Hence the necessity for thorough cooling of food and its maintenance at a low temperature until used.\"\n\nFrigidaire not only maintains a temperature constantly below fifty degrees, but affords a dry atmosphere. With melting ice and the varying temperature it is impossible to accomplish this.\n\nFrigidaire is economical in operation, usually costing less than what you pay for ice. And besides offering better protection to the health of the entire family, it banishes forever the muss, nuisance and the disappointments attendant upon ice and ice delivery.\n\nWhile Frigidaire operates without ice, it freezes cubes of pure ice for table use, makes many new and delicious frozen desserts and is a wonderful aid to the hostess.\n\nYou can buy Frigidaire either as a complete unit or put it in an ice box of your own, on easy terms if you wish. And the total cost is very little more than for many high-grade, ice-cooled refrigerators.\n\nPut Modern Sanitary Refrigeration into Your Home NOW!\nHow Kelvinator Refrigerates\n\nKELVINATOR SALES CORPORATION\nDETROIT, MICHIGAN\nFOREWORD\n\nIt is the purpose of this little book to explain as clearly as possible, and without the use of technical terms, the exact manner in which Kelvinator refrigerates.\n\nAlthough the principle of mechanical refrigeration dates back to a period long before the era of the automobile and electric light, its use, as applied to the home, is, until comparatively recent, not generally known.\n\nKelvinator has been successfully producing electric refrigerating machines for home use for nine years, and now has in operation thousands of units in homes of the better class in all parts of the United States.\nHow Kelvinator Refrigerates\n\nTo understand the principles of a refrigerating machine, operated on the so-called compression system, it is first necessary to understand a few of the fundamental laws of heat, particularly the conditions under which a liquid will boil and evaporate, and a vapor or gas will condense and liquefy.\n\nIn the first place it is important to understand the difference between HEAT and TEMPERATURE.\n\nHeat is a form of energy, and is therefore capable of performing work, or, in other words, it is capable of producing a change in the state of a body. For example, iron or steel are ordinarily in the solid state, but through the application of heat it is possible to change them to the liquid state. Water, in a liquid form, may be changed into a vapor or gaseous state by a similar application of heat.\n\nOn the other hand, TEMPERATURE only indicates the relative hotness of various bodies.\n\nWhenever temperature is referred to in this article, the Fahrenheit scale is used.\n\nHeat, being a form of energy, cannot be destroyed or lost. It may be transferred from one body to another, or it can be transformed into a different kind of energy, e.g., electrical energy, but for our purpose it will only be necessary to consider what takes place when heat is transferred from one body to another.\n\nHeat can be transferred of itself, or can flow, only from a body of a higher temperature to a body of a lower temperature, never in the reverse order. When the colder of two bodies receives heat, two changes take place: First, the temperature of the body may be raised; second, the state of the matter may be changed. If a solid, it may become a liquid; or if a liquid, it may be evaporated into a vapor or gas.\n\nThe difference between heat and temperature.\n\nChanges taking place in the transfer of heat.\nIf a cold body has received heat from a body of higher temperature, it naturally follows that the hotter body has lost some of the heat which it previously contained. This loss of heat can have two results: the temperature of the hotter body may be lowered, or its state may be changed, but since it has lost some of its heat, this change will be from a gaseous state to a liquid state (condensation), or from a liquid state to a solid state (freezing or solidification).\n\nTemperature of body undergoing change of state unchanged during process.\n\nWhen the state of a body is changed, either from the solid to the liquid, or from the liquid to the gaseous, or conversely, from the gaseous to the liquid, or liquid to solid, the temperature of the body remains constant during the time this change is taking place. By way of illustration, suppose we have a vessel filled with crushed ice. The temperature as registered by a thermometer placed in the vessel will be 32 degrees. We now start to heat this vessel. The ice will begin to melt, but even though we continue to add heat, the temperature will not rise above 32 degrees until all the ice has melted. After the ice has entirely melted, the temperature of the water will rise until it reaches about 212 degrees. The water will then start to boil, but the temperature of the boiling water will remain at 212 degrees even though we continue to add heat. The continued application of heat to boiling water will only result in evaporation of the water into steam.\n\nWater, however, does not always boil at 212 degrees. Water in a boiler under 100 pounds gauge pressure, boils at 338 degrees, and under 200 pounds gauge pressure, at 367 degrees, while water in a perfect vacuum would boil at 32 degrees. The temperature at which water will boil is not constant, but varies according to the pressure to which it is subjected.\n\nTemperatures at which various liquids will boil. Effect of atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe boiling points of different liquids vary a great deal. Under atmospheric pressure, water will boil at 212 degrees, mercury at 676 degrees, benzine at 176 degrees, alcohol at 173 degrees, ether at 94 degrees, sulphur-dioxide at 15 degrees, and ammonia at minus 30 degrees. As is the case with water, if the pressure of any of these liquids be increased, the temperature at which they will boil is raised, and if the pressure be decreased, the boiling point will be correspondingly lowered.\n\nTo boil a liquid, it must receive heat from a body of a higher temperature. To boil mercury, the source of heat must have a higher temperature than 676 degrees. To boil sulphur-dioxide (SO\u2082), the source of heat need be only a few degrees hotter than 15 degrees\u2014brine at 20 degrees is sufficient.\n\nRelative coldness of ice and sulphur-dioxide.\n\nMelting ice at 32 degrees is ordinarily considered cold, but it is really warm when compared with boiling sulphur-dioxide at 15 degrees. Liquid sulphur-dioxide at atmospheric pressure can easily be boiled and evaporated by melting ice, because the ice is 17 degrees warmer. Its heat will flow to the sulphur-dioxide, causing it to boil and evaporate into a vapor or gas.\n\nBy placing liquid sulphur-dioxide inside of a coil of pipe and immersing the coil in cold brine, the temperature of which is 25 degrees, the liquid sulphur-dioxide will be boiled and evaporated by the brine. At this point it is important to bear in mind that although the liquid sulphur-dioxide is receiving heat from the brine, yet this heat will not increase the temperature of the sulphur-dioxide, so long as the pressure remains constant, for the reason that the addition of heat to a boiling liquid cannot increase its temperature, but will result only in evaporation. Therefore, with the pressure remaining constant, the liquid sulphur-dioxide will continue to boil at a temperature of 15 degrees so long as it receives heat from the brine.\n\nIf the brine is giving up its heat to the boiling sulphur-dioxide, what change is taking place in the brine? There can be but one result\u2014the lowering of the temperature of the brine. Brine of a proper strength will not freeze until its temperature is about zero. As the brine continues to give up its heat, its temperature will drop until it is equal to that of the boiling sulphur-dioxide. When this occurs, heat can no longer flow from the brine to the sulphur-dioxide, and the boiling and evaporating process will stop.\n\nWhen water is boiled in a tight vessel or boiler, the evaporation of the water into steam will cause an increase in pressure, unless the steam is utilized or carried away as rapidly as it is generated. If sulphur-dioxide is evaporated inside of a closed coil, the pressure inside of this coil will also rise unless the vapor or gas is carried away as fast as\n\nThe brine tank; manner in which it produces refrigeration.\n\nIncrease of pressure produced by boiling process.\nit is formed. If the pressure inside the coil rises, the temperature at which the liquid will boil will also rise. Therefore, if a constant boiling temperature is to be had, we must maintain a uniform pressure inside the coils while evaporation is taking place. A simple way to do this would be to let the gas pass off into the atmosphere, but this would necessitate having almost an unlimited supply of refrigerant and would be impractical, owing to the expense involved. The practical way to secure the desired result is to again liquefy the vapor and use it over and over.\n\nHow is liquefaction brought about? It has been shown that in order to boil a liquid and evaporate it into gas or vapor, heat must be applied. To change this vapor or gas back to the liquid state, the process must be reversed, and it must be caused to lose or give up the heat received during evaporation. As heat can flow only from a body of higher temperature to one of lower temperature, this vapor or gas cannot be condensed or changed into a liquid at atmospheric pressure, unless a substance of a temperature lower than 15 degrees can be found. This, of course, is not practicable.\n\nIt has been explained that the temperature at which a liquid will boil rises as the pressure is increased. It therefore follows that the temperature at which a gas will condense will also rise if the pressure is increased. It must be emphasized at this point that the pressure being constant, the temperature at which any liquid will boil is the same as the temperature at which its gas will condense, the only difference being that heat must be applied to evaporate a liquid, whereas heat must be extracted in order to condense a vapor or gas.\n\nThe table on this page shows, for various pressures, the corresponding temperatures at which either sulphur-dioxide will boil if heat is applied, or at which its vapor or gas will condense when the heat is extracted.\n\n| Vac. | Gauge Pressure (lbs. per sq. in.) | Pounds |\n|------|----------------------------------|--------|\n| 20   | 10                              | 0      |\n| 5    | 10                              | 5      |\n| 15   | 15                              | 10     |\n| 20   | 20                              | 15     |\n| 25   | 25                              | 20     |\n| 30   | 30                              | 25     |\n| 35   | 35                              | 30     |\n| 40   | 40                              | 35     |\n| 45   | 45                              | 40     |\n| 50   | 50                              | 45     |\n| 55   | 55                              | 50     |\n| 60   | 60                              | 55     |\n| 65   | 65                              | 60     |\n| Temp.Fahr. | 24 | 70                              |\n\nBy referring to this table it will be noted that at a gauge pressure of 50 pounds, liquid sulphur-dioxide will boil, or its gas will condense, at 85 degrees.\n\nIf the gas is taken from the brine tank, compressed to 50 pounds and discharged into a coil or condenser which is also at 50 pounds pressure, the gas in this coil will condense at a temperature of 85 degrees. If this coil is in a room, the temperature of which is lower than 85 degrees, the heat will flow from the gas in the coil to the air in the room. The loss of heat will change the compressed gas to a liquid. This liquid will still be at a pressure of 50 pounds to the square inch, and before it can again be made to boil at a temperature of 15 degrees, it must be reduced to atmospheric pressure. This reduction is brought about by an automatic pressure regulating valve, commonly called the expansion valve. This valve is so constructed that it will maintain a uniform pressure in the expansion coil, regardless of what the pressure in the condenser may be.\n\nThe liquid sulphur-dioxide passes through the expansion valve into the expansion coils which are located inside the brine tank. This expansion valve is automatic in its action and is so constructed as to maintain a constant pressure inside the expansion coil. This expansion valve may be adjusted so as to maintain a pressure of one, two, or three pounds per square inch, as conditions may require. The approximate temperature at which the liquid sulphur-dioxide will boil at these pressures are:\n\n| Gauge Pressure (lbs. per sq. in.) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n|-----------------------------------|---|---|---|---|\n| Boiling Temperature               | 15| 17| 19| 21|\n\nThe liquid sulphur-dioxide, being at a temperature of from 15 to 21 degrees, depending upon its pressure, is boiled and evaporated by the brine, which is usually held at a temperature of between 20 and 28 degrees. The gas is led back to the compressor, which compresses it to a pressure whose corresponding temperature of condensation is about 25 to 30 degrees higher than the temperature of the surrounding air. As an illustration, if the temperature of the room in which the condenser is placed is 60 degrees, the pressure in the condenser, as measured by the pressure gauge, would be approximately 55 pounds. The corresponding temperature of condensation, as shown by the table before is 89 degrees. Thus, the temperature of condensation of the gas is 29 degrees higher than the temperature of the room. Again, assume the temperature of the room to be 70 degrees, the gauge pressure in the con-\n\nFunction of the expansion valve.\n\nTemperatures at which liquid sulphur-dioxide will boil under pressure.\n\nRelative temperature of condensation.\ndenser would probably be about 70 pounds per square inch. The corresponding temperature of condensation is 100 degrees. Therefore, the temperature of the gas inside the condenser is 30 degrees higher than the temperature of the room.\n\nUnder these conditions the heat will flow from the gas into the air, with the result that this gas will be condensed and liquefied and will again be ready to pass through the expansion valve into the coils and repeat its process of evaporation.\n\nIt has been shown how the liquid sulphur-dioxide is evaporated into a gas by the heat received from the brine. As a result of giving up its heat, the temperature of the brine is reduced. As the sulphur-dioxide takes heat from the brine, so does the brine take heat from the circulating air in the refrigerator in which it is placed.\n\nHow frost deposits appear on brine tank.\n\nThe air contains a certain amount of moisture, or water, which, when it comes in contact with the brine tank, is immediately frozen and deposits on the tank as frost. In this manner the air inside the refrigerator cooled by a brine tank not only is kept at a low temperature, but is also kept relatively dry.\n\nCirculation of air in modern refrigerators.\n\nModern refrigerators are so designed as to obtain the greatest possible circulation of air, in order that the entire box may be kept at a uniformly low temperature. Cold air, being heavier than warm, will drop to the lowest point of the refrigerator. Inasmuch as all refrigerators are practically air tight, if the cold air drops, it forces the warm air to rise. This sets the air in motion and if the refrigerator is properly designed, the air can be made to follow a certain definite path of circulation inside the box.\n\nCustomary arrangements to facilitate the easy circulation of air in refrigerators.\n\nThe usual arrangement for proper air circulation in a refrigerator with an ice compartment at the side is shown in Fig. 1. As the air surrounding the brine tank is cooled, it will drop to the lowest point, which will force the remainder of the air inside the refrigerator into motion. The construction of the refrigerator is such that the air must follow a certain definite path, as indicated by the arrow.\n\nIn this manner the warm air is forced out of the food compartment, passes into the ice compartment through the flue at the top, where it is cooled by contact with the brine tank, and again drops to the lowest point in the refrigerator.\n\nA common arrangement for circulation in a refrigerator made with an ice compartment on top is shown in Fig. 2. By this arrangement the cold air descends through the flue in the center of the box, which in turn forces the warm air to rise through the passages on the sides of the ice chamber with the result that the warm air comes in contact with the brine tank and is cooled.\n15 REASONS\n\nWHY YOU WANT Kelvinator REFRIGERATION\n\n1\u2014You get rid of the ice man.\n2\u2014During absence from home you have no worry about ice\u2014KELVINATOR works while you are away.\n3\u2014You escape the odors produced by the use of ice. These odors contaminate your food.\n4\u2014You get rid of the accumulation of slime and dirt in your refrigerator and its drains; and you are saved the annoyance of cleaning them out.\n5\u2014You escape the danger of bringing disease germs to your food and drink.\n6\u2014You escape the plumber cleaning out obstructed drains from your ice box.\n7\u2014On hot days KELVINATOR gives you more refrigeration to meet the excessive heat; as against which, ice melts faster and you get less refrigeration when you need it most.\n8\u2014KELVINATOR gives even refrigeration. This even temperature prevents fermentation and decay, restrains germ culture, and removes the danger of food-poisoning.\n9\u2014You get a dry, colder, and purer air\u2014preventing loss of food.\n10\u2014KELVINATOR saves ice bills. You pay the ice man as long as you live\u2014when you buy a KELVINATOR you finish paying. Interest on the sum you have already paid for ice will more than equal the interest on the price of a KELVINATOR\u2014continue paying the ice man and you add to the interest cost. Buy a KELVINATOR and stop it.\n11\u2014Depreciation? Your ice bill is 100% depreciation; with your KELVINATOR it does not exceed 10%.\n12\u2014What you pay for ice is an operating expense and a total loss; what you pay for a KELVINATOR is an investment.\n13\u2014Measured by the hours and degrees of cold delivered by KELVINATOR, its service is worth 50% more than ice.\n14\u2014The dampness of ice corrodes and decays your ice box; the dryness of KELVINATOR preserves it.\n15\u2014KELVINATOR is no experiment. Years of service to thousands of users prove its worth.

OF SMYTHE)\nVANCOUVER, B.C. March 24th, 1926.\n\nMr. W. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDominion Government,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your request for full particulars regarding Kelvinator Refrigerating apparatus as contemplated for the Sechelt Indian School we enclose herewith\n\n(a) \"How Kelvinator works\" being details of the principal and application in practice.\n\n(b) \"Kelvinated Foods\" being a pamphlet on the advantage of dry refrigeration over ice and of the adaptibility of Kelvinator to the Refrigeration problem.\n\n(c) A sketch of the proposed plant as it will appear when completed.\n\nFather Swenceski went into this subject at great length and a quotation has been sent him based on his requirements and our own knowledge of the plant adaptable to his present lighting plant.\n\nOur Mr. Ferrier has lately returned from Sechelt where he was doing some repairs. Mr. Ferrier states that in regard to additional load on the batteries it would be a benefit rather than a detriment allowing the batteries to go more completely through the charge and discharge cycle. Under the present arrangement there is danger of overcharging and additional load is actually advisable.\n\nThe point in any case is, that the Sechelt plant is capable of handling the Kelvinator without impairing its efficiency in the least.\n\nThe system we recommend and on which we quote is for a box six feet square, for keeping meat or other perishables at the proper Temperature, constantly. This is done by cooling tanks in the refrigerator and two senior Kelvinator units on the top of the refrigerator where they will not take up room and be away from meddling hands. As the machine needs no adjusting or attention this is advisable in any case. Freezing trays will be furnished so that if ice is required twelve to fifteen pounds may be made every few hours. The same applies to frozen foods or dishes. The idea of the two units is to provide ample refrigeration in hottest weather and when less refrigeration is required in fall or winter one machine is sufficient conforming to the load of the lighting plant.\nThe motors use three amperes per hour each from the batteries and run a half hour in every four in daytime and possibly once during the night depending on service.\n\nWe particularly draw to your attention the Brine Tank storage system of the Kelvinator. In the case of failure in the source of power there is enough refrigeration in storage to last better than twenty-four hours. The Kelvinator uses no floats, weights or lever mechanism. There are no belt tension or idler pulley devices. Kelvinator has no oiling trouble. Nothing to get out of order, and where it is so isolated from Service, --this point is worth remembering. The temperature is automatically maintained by a thermostat that is unfailing in its duty and is free from dust, dirt, sediment, or moisture. The machine once installed requires no attention except an oiling every three months, a simple matter with an oil can.\n\nWe have a large number of these plants in B.

The damp air on the coast is an aid to food spoilage. The Kelvinator is particularly adapted to work in this climate as moisture is frozen to the cooling units and does not melt and drip during the non operating periods and form ice. Kelvinator keeps the moisture in frost form.\n\nOur quotation was as follows under date of July 7th, 1925\n\n2 Kelvinator Senior type compressor Units, installed complete in your refrigerator for the sum of Thirteen Hundred and Ninety dollars $1,390.00\n\n1/6 x 6 x 6 Refrigerator, built in section, shipped and assembled complete with hardware and in operating order built to our own specifications for the sum of Four Hundred dollars $400.00\n\nor a total of Seventeen Hundred and Ninety dollars $1,790.00\nOn account of the time required to build the box, test and ship it and the time lost in bringing the equipment from the East, we would esteem it a favor to have you give the subject your early consideration.\n\nKelvinator is a Canadian product, manufactured by Canadians, for the Empire trade, in Canada.\n\nThinking you for the opportunity of being able to bring this matter direct to your attention and assuring you in the event of receiving your authority to proceed with the work, of despatch and thoroughness which may enable use to participate in other future refrigeration requirements.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nTHE JARVIS ELECTRIC CO. LTD.\nKelvinator Distributors.\n\nper\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th December referring to the matter of equipping the Sechelt Residential School with a refrigerating plant, I beg to say that I have had some correspondence with Rev. A.J. Swiderski, Principal of the School, as to what he had in view when asking the Department for a refrigerating plant, and he has informed me that he had figured on a box of the Kelvinator type with six cubic feet space which he thinks would suit his purpose. This he proposed to install in a pantry in the cement basement of the School. As you mentioned the Jarvis Electric Company in your letter as having made a proposal for the installation of an electric generating plant, I called on this Firm in Vancouver to look into the merits of the system which they had proposed and found that they handled the Kelvinator system. In order that I could see the capabilities of this refrigerating plant other than in the ordinary manufactured refrigerator, I was taken to one of the beer parlours where they have installed a large box with eight cubic feet and I learned from the proprietor that this admirably fulfilled the purpose for which it was intended. This box, however, being larger than the one proposed for the School, merely keeps the air extremely cool, whereas with the six-foot box the air would be almost at freezing point.\n\nAs this is a subject on which I have very little knowledge, I have had the Jarvis Electric Company write to me fully on the subject and I am attaching hereto their letter of the 24th March with sketch, also printed matter on the system. You will observe that they undertake the installation of a box with six cubic feet of space with 2 Kelvinator compressed units at the School for $1,790.00.\n\nIn connection with the objection which you raise in your letter that it might be wise to connect such a system with the electric generating plant, I would draw your attention to the marked paragraphs of this Company's letter in which it is shown that it would have no injurious effect on the same, in fact it is stated that it would be more of a benefit.\n\nThe Bruce Robinson Electric Company of Vancouver, producers of the Delco-Light Products, also have a system of about the same character as the Kelvinator and I am also enclosing herewith one of the folders on \"Frigid Aire\".\n\nOutside of the installation of one of these smaller\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsystems the only alternative would be to build a freezing plant at the School such as the one at Kamloops and if you think this would be more preferable, the proper thing to do would be to have one of the Engineers of the Dominion Water Power Branch visit the School and make a report with regard to the establishment of the latter plant in a special building. This, however, would require a larger engine than the one at present at the School as there is no electric current nor water power in the district capable of generating the power.\n\nWhen you have perused the pamphlet which the Jarvis people have loaned, will you kindly return the same to me?\n\nI have no idea of what the cost of the freezing plant at the Kamloops School amounted to. I would, however, think that one not quite so large as that at Kamloops would be ample for the requirements of the School at Sechelt.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

C.\nSept. 27, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Electric Lighting Plant\nSecwelt School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant incorporating Engineer Warren's report and estimate of cost to put the electric lighting plant at the Secwelt Indian School in good condition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted the Engineer states that a new set of batteries would cost $1500.00, but, I may say the Jarvis Electric Company, in April last, gave a quotation of $722.50 for renewing all the old plate with a 50-gallon electrolyte all installed and with one year's guarantee. All this Firm would use of the present battery would be the old jars. The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company also quoted a price of $640.00 f.o.b. Toronto, which, with freight and installation charges would, no doubt, run about $1,000.00. Engineer Warren suggests a battery set of 300 amperes. The Canadian-Fairbanks-Morse Company's suggestion was for a 260 amperes battery. I do not know the capacity of the present batteries in use at the school, but it must be considerably smaller than that recommended by Engineer Warren. Copies of the two estimates above referred to are attached hereto for your information.\n\nIn view of the difficulty in obtaining money from Ottawa this year, do you think it would not be possible for the school to get along for some time by merely renewing the present battery set, and accepting the tender of the Jarvis Electric Company? I say this in view of the fact that I was authorized to purchase a battery set, but I have thought though they would be available for some little time to entail the expenditure suggested by Engineer Warren which is $2275.00. You will observe the Jarvis Electric people state they could have the battery plates installed inside of two weeks after receiving the order. How long would it take to get the set of batteries which Engineer Warren recommends? It is doubtful if the school can operate very long unless something is done to put the plant in workable shape.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.E.DITCHBURN\nIndian Commissioner for B.

C.\nSept. 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Sechelt Indian Boarding School Electric Light Plant\n\nIn compliance with your request of the 26th ultimo, I have had an investigation made of the Electric Lighting Plant of the Sechelt Boarding School by Mr. W. C. Warren and from his report to me of September 20th, I have to advise you as follows:\n\n\"The plant consists of a 6 H.P. Fairbanks, horizontal type, gas engine rated at 450 R. per minute, belt connected to a 3\u00bd Kw. Fairbanks shuntwound generator rated at 1400 R. per minute and a 56 cell, 180 amp.hr. 112 volt, Western Electric storage battery. This plant with the exception of the engine, which was replaced about two years ago, has been in operation since the school was built.\n\nThe work of the plant has reached its total capacity. About 25% more lights are now required than when the plant was installed. In addition to the lighting requirements, the gas engine also drives the laundry machinery and requires about 4\u00bd H.P. to operate. The laundry machinery consists of a washing machine 1 H.P. and extractor \u00be H.P. These of course are only operated one day a week. The process of charging the battery and operating the washing machine being carried on at the same time, while to operate the extractor, the generator load has to be released. The extractor, however, is only run 5 or 10 minutes at a time. In summer the battery requires charging twice or three times a week, while in winter it is necessary to charge everyday.\n\nThe present battery is almost completely worn out and will have to be replaced before the present winter. The engine, although not very economical in operation is in fair condition and the generator has recently been overhauled.\n\nThe cost of renewing the present battery would be practically as much as the cost of a new one and the results would be uncertain.\n\nThe engine is slightly under the amount of power necessary to operate this plant successfully and cannot be run economically. The fuel consumption at full load amounts to one gallon per hour. By the installation of a crude oil engine a saving of about $125.00 per year, in operating cost, could be effected.\"\nIn view of the contemplated future installation of a refrigeration plant and the necessity of more storage for the additional lights already added to the system, it is recommended that a battery of larger capacity be installed in place of the one now in use. The cost of a new system of approximately 300 ampere capacity would be $1500. This cost would be somewhat lessened by the salvage value of the old one, which might amount to $150. The engine while serviceable requires constant repairs as it is overloaded under the present arrangement. Economy has been practised at the school in the matter of labour, and where formerly three men were employed, one now attends to all the outside work and also operates the heating plant and electric light plant. It is necessary that these plants operate successfully so that this arrangement can be maintained.\n\nIt is recommended that the engine now in use be disposed of and a 6 H.P. crude oil one be substituted at a cost of $600.00. The salvage value of the old engine would be about $100.00\n\nThe total cost of the improvements proposed would be $2,275.00. Allowing for possible recovery from plant disposed of, this might be reduced to about $2,000.00.\n\n**Itemized Cost of Plant**\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| New Battery 300 ampere        | $1500  |\n| Diesel Engine - 6 H.P.        | 590    |\n| 2 pulleys                     | 35     |\n| Freight                       | 100    |\n| Installation & Inspection Expenses | 50    |\n| **TOTAL**                     | **$2275** |\n\nIt is of course possible to make some improvements to the plant at a cost less than outlined above, so that system may function more or less satisfactorily for a year or two. However with the installation of a large battery and diesel engine as above recommended a most satisfactory system will be obtained which should function at a minimum cost of operation for seven or eight years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\"G.E.Webb\",\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nW.H.Ditchburn, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nBox 66, Victoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCOPY\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service.\nVancouver, B. C.\nOct. 11, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Electric Lighting Plant\nSachelt School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo and note that the Jarvis Electric Company have tendered a price of $722.50 for renewal of old battery. I may say that this is practically the price of a new battery of the capacity already at the school (180 amperehours). The price, $640.00, quoted by the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company for one of 240 amperehours capacity is reasonable for that size battery. To this amount however would have to be added freight charges which would bring the price up to approximately $1200.00. This battery while larger than that already in the school is not considered of sufficient capacity for the demands of the service. I would recommend that the larger capacity battery, as suggested by Mr. Warren, be installed. While the cost is somewhat more, the lifetime of the battery would be prolonged and give more satisfactory service. The battery suggested can be installed in three weeks time.\n\nIn respect to the engine it is not necessary at the present time, except to cut the cost of operation. The present engine is good for several years yet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"C.E. Webb\"\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nBox 666, Victoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Lighting Plant Sechelt School.\n\nOn the 23rd March last you wired me to see about having a new set of battery plates installed at the Sechelt Indian School as the old ones were reported to be in poor condition.\n\nI obtained a price of $722.50 from the Jervis Electric Company, of Vancouver, which was for the providing of new plates to replace the old ones, and a 50-gallon electrolyte tank. The company also used up the old battery jars. The capacity of the present batteries is 160 ampere hours. I was instructed to accept this price providing it was the most satisfactory one I could obtain. The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company then quoted a price of $840.00 f.o.b. Toronto, for a 280 ampere hour set of batteries.\n\nAs the supplying of a new battery set appeared to be contingent on the installation of a Kelvinator cooling plant for the School, I preferred to take no action until I had learned whether the cooling plant would be purchased this year. The Department, however, decided that the installation of a Kelvinator plant must be laid over until next year. Nothing further was therefore done about the purchase of a battery set. On June 29th Rev. Principal of the School wrote to me that the lighting system in the School had given out and that he had sent the Dynamo to Vancouver for repairs, thus indicating that the trouble was not with the batteries. The Principal also stated that the 6 h.p. engine in use at the School was not large enough to run a 3\u00bd K.W. dynamo, which required a 5\u00bd h.p. engine, and at the same time run a 20\" laundry extractor also requiring 5\u00bd h.p., as well as a 30\" x 36\" washing machine requiring a further 1/2 h.p. The repairs to the dynamo apparently were sufficient for the time being but at the end of August it was found something further would have to be done to meet the requirements and as this was a subject with which I was not familiar, I seemed it in the best interest of the Department and Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch at Vancouver, to have one of his engineers, who had experience on such matters, go to Sechelt as soon as possible to see just what was required to put the plant in proper shape.\n\nOn the 25th ultimo Mr. Webb furnished me with the report of Engineer Warren, which provided for a new set of batteries.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbatteries of 300 ampere hour capacity, a new Diesel engine and two pulleys, the total cost of which, including freight, installation and inspection is put down at $2,275.00. A copy of Engineer Warren's report is attached hereto for your information in which you will observe that it is deemed essential that a new battery set should be installed at an early date.\n\nOwing to the difficulty in obtaining money at Ottawa at present, I again wrote to Mr. Webb pointing this phase of the question out, and asking him if it would not be possible for the School to get along for a time by merely renewing the batteries. I also pointed out the prices which had been submitted by the Joliet Electric Company and the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse, they being much lower than the figure quoted by Engineer Warren, but he has now informed me that neither the battery at present at the School nor the one quoted on by the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse people are large enough for the requirements of the School and he would recommend the larger size set. So far as a new engine is concerned, Mr. Webb concludes that this is not necessary at the present time except to cut the cost of operation. The engine now in use at the School is apparently good for several years yet.\n\nIn view of the above I would strongly recommend that if it is impossible at the present time to provide sufficient funds for the full new equipment as recommended by Engineer Warren, that the new and larger battery set be purchased and installed at as early a date as possible, under the direction of an engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

C.\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nCommissioner Ditchburn, of Victoria, B.C., has had under advisement the matter of renewing the electric light plant at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. Some months ago, I knew that the batteries would have to be replaced; but I am now informed that the Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch has strongly recommended a new engine as well. I should be pleased if you would authorize the improvement, which will cost approximately $8,000, and concur in my proposal to secure the funds in the December warrant.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI beg to inform you that yesterday I had a call from Rev. Father John Duplanil, Principal of the Sechelt Residential School, and he brought to my attention the necessity of being furnished with a DeLaval 1\u00bd h.p. boiler for the laundry, which will greatly facilitate their work at the school in this regard. He informed me that the boiler can be purchased from the DeLaval Agency in Vancouver at a cost of about $150.00. Father Duplanil has only recently been transferred to Sechelt from St. Mary's School at Mission, at which place he had one of these boilers and he spoke very highly of its usefulness.\n\nThe Rev. Principal also pointed out that the outside doors of the school are in need of re-varnishing and oiling afterwards. He would, therefore, like to obtain 3 gallons of hard varnish and a 44-gallon drum of boiled oil which can be used on all the woodwork of the building besides protecting the shingles on the roof.\n\nHe would also like to have about 3 gallons of gray paint and 1/2 dozen paint brushes with which to repaint all the outside woodwork as it is in great need of a further coat. All the work could be done by the pupils and the Father is only asking to be supplied with the material.\n\nHe has also asked to be supplied with 8 dozen cups, saucers and soup plates of heavy hotel Delf ware.\n\nI would recommend that the articles above mentioned should be purchased for the School.\n\nAs telephone connection can now be had with Gibson's Landing, at which place Dr. Inglis has his office, I would recommend that a telephone be installed at the school, the cost of which would be $30.00 with an additional $30.00 per annum as rental.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

John Duplanil, Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. You may purchase the varnish, boiled oil and paint material mentioned in your letter and also a 1\u00bd horse power boiler for the laundry. Competitive prices should be secured if possible. This boiler, however, must be installed in the boiler room and not in the laundry. I regret that the Department does not make replacements of cups, saucers, etc., and that it will be necessary for the school to purchase these from the per capita or other earnings. You may also arrange for the installation of a telephone, at a cost of $30; but it must be clearly understood that the school will have to pay the annual charges.\n\nI might add that consideration is being given to your letter of the 14th, concerning a lighting plant at this school and you will receive a communication in a few days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

These were invoices 561 and 486 of the Breckman-Ker Milling Co., Vancouver, for sums of $27.20 and $16.55, respectively. These I regret to say have been returned by the Department under cover of their letter dated March 23rd., No. 167-18-5, which states as follows:\n\n\"I have your 1/100 of the 21st. inst., enclosing vouchers Nos. 2397 and 2399 covering spraying material and seeds supplied to two Indian Residential Schools by Mr. W.

I understand that Mr. Anderson had authority to purchase for Indian orchards but this did not include the Residential Schools. Please correspond with Mr. Anderson, with a view to ascertaining whether he provided that the Department would pay these accounts. If so, they should be sent to the Schools for payment. He should also be advised that Indian Residential Schools are responsible for purchases of this kind.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) J. D.

Perry Esq\nIndian Agent\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nReplying to your letter of 7th inst No. 1/40 regarding supplies to St Paul's School and that of Sechelt, I must inform you that in a letter dated Feb 15th ult enclosing requisitions and tenders from firms interested, from me to the Department of Indian Affairs, for nursery stock &c., for the various B.C. Agencies, the following items appear: St Paul's School, 5th Grade, 10 lbs whale oil soap, 50 lbs Bordeaux, 10 lbs lead arsenate, 50 lbs lime-sulph Co., 3 lbs Elk leaf 40% sprays, and\u2014\"M\" peaches, 10 apples, 6 currant, 6 roses\u2014Nursery stock, Sechelt Indian School, 50 lbs alfalfa seed.\n\nIn a letter from the Department to me under date of Feb 22nd, No. 43/1 A., there is the following:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with which you forwarded tenders for fruit trees, sprays and other garden supplies required by Indians of British Columbia, and in reply I may say that the lowest tender in each case should be accepted; namely: the tender of the British Columbia Nurseries Company Limited, ---- \"for fruit trees. The tender of the Brackman-Ker Milling Company Limited, ---- \"for sprays, and also the tender of the last mentioned firm, for hose, pruners and alfalfa seed.\"\n\n(Signed) F.H. Paget\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThis I think will cover all questions as to Departmental sanction for the school purchases. I may however, call your attention to the fact that similar supplies have been made by the Department through me ever since I have held office. If it is the intention to discontinue the practice, I should much like to be so informed at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of April 8th. with regard to the Vouchers for sprays, etc., and in reply would say there appears to be no doubt as to your authority for purchase. You omitted to mention, however, the point raised by the Department as to whether you promise the School, that the Department would pay for this material or otherwise. Kindly send me a further brief note on this point, so that I may give a definite answer to the Department to its question.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(C.C. Perry)\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. B.

Perry Esq\nIndian Agent\nVancouver B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI do not understand the reason for your question in your letter of 11th inst as to whether I \"promised\". I never promise anything to either Indian or White on behalf of the Government. When a request is made to me for anything in a horticultural way from the Department, I tell the requestor that I will apply for the same from the Department, and if that body grant the request, it will be procured. In the case in question, what I did, and what the Department authorized me to do is all set down in my letter to you of the 8th inst.\n\nI am at a loss to understand the whole affair. Mr. McLean must have passed many such accounts in the last 20 years, from myself and from my predecessor, Tom Wilson. Every tree and spray apparatus in the B.C. Indian schools have been supplied in this identical way.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Indian Orchards\nApril 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated March 29th., No. 167-18-5, returning Vouchers Nos. 2397 and 2399 covering spraying materials and seeds supplied to the Sechelt and North Vancouver Indian Residential Schools by Mr. W.B. Anderson.\n\nIn reply I beg to transmit herewith my correspondences with Mr. Anderson with regard to the question asked by the Department with regard to any promises made by him that the Department would pay these accounts. These correspondences will be self-explanatory.\n\nI beg herewith to retransmit to the Department the vouchers above mentioned together with an additional voucher No. 2464 for the sum of $7.50, which has been certified by Mr. Anderson with regard to nursery stock furnished the Squamish Indian Residential School, otherwise known as St. Paul's School, at North Vancouver. These vouchers are all certified for payment, decision upon which must rest with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[C. C.

B. Anderson, and enclosing correspondence regarding the matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to pay these accounts in this instance, but, in future, it is expected that the schools will be responsible, from their per capita grant or other receipts, for the payment of any materials required for spraying and the cost of the work. In the case where fruit trees are required to start an orchard at a school, the Department might, after full particulars have been received regarding requirements, approve of an expenditure towards the payment for same. All garden seeds should be paid for by the school. Any authority which Mr. Anderson has to purchase for Indian orchards does not include residential or day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

John Duplanil authorizing him to have certain improvements made in the boiler room of this school by the Vancouver Machinery Depot, for the approximate cost of $156.74. I wish to say that, as his successor, I took up the matter. I soon felt that there was a mistake made and that the boiler expected of the Vancouver Machinery Depot would not replace the old installation, and so, I had the Machinery Depot send up a man to see exactly what it was that required replacing. He soon discovered that the old boiler has a heating coil within it, and that the pressure on the water in the coil is about a hundred pounds per sq.in., greater than the pressure on the water in the boiler. This requires a very good job on the coils, and, with the extra connections, and the installation, etc., etc., increases the cost a great deal above that of the mere boiler. The detailed statement of the Machinery Depot shows the total cost replacement of the boiler and its attachments as $374.05, as against the $125.00 for the boiler alone, Fob. Vancouver. In view of this difference, I withdrew the order until getting your authorization for the new\namount. Also, the Christmas season being near, I did not wish to run the danger of having our heating system out of order during that time. I should mention that the amount given covers the work of installing, etc., etc., as well as transportation of materials from Vancouver, leaving the boiler ready for use.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 18, 1926.\n\nRev.

They explain that the boilers of schools, etc., for the Department are inspected usually on request, and as the Sechelt boilers were inspected last year they naturally expected that the inspection would be repeated this year and they billed the Department with the present year's inspection in view. They also say it is customary to have fees paid before the inspection is actually made.\n\nI requested them to send me an account as desired by the Department and this is now sent here-with attached to Voucher No. 3044. I would request the cheque for this service be sent in my care so that I may formally request by letter that the inspection be made.

If you are assured that the work has been satisfactorily completed, please attach the enclosed accounts to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nWe are informing the Rev. Principal that, in future, he should forward all requests and accounts through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. R. Mackenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, July 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, addressed to the Indian Commissioner at Victoria, relative to certain repairs to the roofs of the buildings and to the washing machine, also with reference to certain fencing required and repairs to the chicken house.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding these requests. You should state if you consider any of the work mentioned is urgent and ascertain from the Principal what amount, if same is authorized, can be carried out by the school management.\n\nWith reference to the dishes mentioned, I may say that it is considered this equipment should be provided by the school authorities from their per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nPlease give this matter your early attention and report as to the repairs, etc., which you would recommend be carried out. We are informing Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn that the request of the Principal has been referred to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, July 18, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter, dated June 14th, last, enclosing an account, in duplicate, in favour of the Vancouver Iron Works, Limited, to the amount of $374, covering the cost of the hot water tank installed. We are returning this account to Mr. Agent Perry, as it is necessary that he certify same before payment can be made.\n\nI have to request that, in future, you will forward all communications regarding matters in connection with the Sechelt School as well as accounts through the office of Mr. C. C. Perry, Indian Agent, 415 Winch Building, Vancouver. It is necessary that requests made by you for repairs, equipment, etc., be forwarded to the Department accompanied by the recommendation of your local agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. McGaffrey, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSechelt, B. C.\nOttawa, July 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Rev. J. McCaffrey, O.M.I., Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, in which he requests that certain improvements be carried out also that a new washing machine, etc., be supplied. The Department is referring this matter to Mr. Agent C. C. Perry. When a report is received from him, consideration will be given to authorizing having the repairs, etc., carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated July 18th, No. 167-18-5, covering copy of a communication from the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School making requisition for repairs to the roofs of the Sechelt Residential School buildings and other desired work.\n\nIn reply thereto I beg to say that I have consulted with the Principal of the School, who informs me that if the expenditure referred to are authorized by the Department the management will have the work done, except the installation of a new drum for washing machines and the repair of the roofs, which require expert labor. The management expects the Department to pay for labor.\n\nReporting on the work, etc., for which authority is asked under their respective heads I beg to state:\n\n1. Permanent repair of flat roofs over kitchen, laundry and boiler room at cost of approximately $80.00 is recommended. I can procure a cauldron and spreader for the asphaltum in Vancouver and return it after use, the cost for loan of these utensils being nominal.\n\n2. The staining of the roofs of the main building and chapel at approximate cost of $109.00 is recommended inasmuch as the roofs have not been stained since the building was first completed.\n\nThe cost of the above two items over and above the estimate of the Principal is on account of freight charges, hire of utensils, wharfage and cartage at Sechelt, not estimated by the Principal. I think the work should be done if possible before the frosty weather sets in. If this can not be done it should be left over until the spring.\n\n3. Thirty-one windows to be covered with hardware wire cloth 3 x 3 mesh, 30 inches wide, galvanized, would involve a cost of approximately $57.00 complete. This work is not considered urgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n4. Drum of washing machine. As this is purchasable in Toronto, I would recommend the same to be obtained and forwarded at the earliest possible date, as it is urgently required to replace one worn out. The cost can not be given or obtained in Vancouver in so far as I am able to ascertain.\n\n5. Fencing. In this matter the Department will be aware that on the 16th April 1925 by letter No. 27167-1 the Department authorized Mr. L. S. Cokely, Land Surveyor of Courtenay, B.C., to proceed with the surveying of the limits of a fifteen acre parcel on Sechelt Reserve No. 2 which it was agreed by the members of the Band on February 17th, 1925 should be set aside for the purpose of the Indian Boarding School at that point. I have not since that time been advised of the completion of this survey by Mr. Cokely nor have I on file any map or data in this connection. I think it is advisable that a map should be sent to me that would aid me in locating the posts planted by this surveyor who carried out his work under the supervision of the Indian Commissioner at Victoria. The fencing is not considered urgent except that it would prevent horses and cattle from straying onto the public highway. A small portion only of the property assigned to the school has as yet been cleared, in fact some of the stumping which was done under direction of this Department has not been followed up by clearing of the debris as had been anticipated by the Rev. Father Anthony, a former Principal, who was inclined to outdoor activities and farm development, and was later removed by the Church authorities to Kamloops or another Interior Boarding School. Reverend Father John, Rev. Father Barney and the present Principal, Rev. Father McCaffrey are men of scholastic type and do not appear to be as enthusiastic about developing this land as Father Anthony was. Had Father Anthony remained at Sechelt, no doubt a great deal more land would have been cleared. I would also point out that the land is poor and sandy and even when treated with heavy applications of fertilizer has not been as productive as might be desired. This matter could receive fuller consideration and an estimate of material required could be better prepared were I provided with a surveyor's plan showing definite areas and the description given by the Reverend Principal under Section 5 of his letter could be more useful if augmented by this plan.\n\n6. Chicken house. This I believe to be necessary as the houses in present use are very old and some are getting rotten. Approximately $15.00 should be added to the Principal's estimate of $260.00, to take care of freight, wharfage and cartage. I would recommend that this work be carried out as early as possible.\n\n7. The Reverend Principal has been advised of the Department's observations to the effect it is considered this equipment.\nSeptember 22, 1928.\n\nThis equipment should be provided by the school authorities from their Per Capita Grant or other receipts.\n\nI would add that the foregoing items have been placed in my estimates for 1929-30, and Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn has been advised that there is a probability that the Department may authorize some of this expenditure during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(C.C. Perry)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 29, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe Department requires a new drum for the washing machine at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, Sechelt, B.C. We understand that this machine was purchased from your firm in 1922. The make of the machine is stated to be No. 1213 - M.7091.\n\nI have to request that you will state whether the information furnished is sufficient to enable you to supply the new drum required. If so, I shall be pleased if you will state the cost of same F.O.B. Sechelt, B.C. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to placing an order for the supplying of the drum required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nCanadian Laundry Machinery Co.,\nToronto,\nOnt.\nOttawa, September 29, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School for repairs to the roof of the school building, for the supplying of a drum for the washing machine, fencing, and for the erection of a chicken house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $50 in repairing the flat roofs over the kitchen, laundry and boiler room. It is noted that the loan of a cauldron and spreader for the asphaltum can be obtained.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the funds required for the staining of the roofs of the main building and chapel.\n\nApproval is also granted for an expenditure of approximately $57 for the supplying of the wire cloth for 30 windows.\n\nRelative to the fencing, it is considered that this will have to stand over until next year, at which time full particulars should be given as to the quantity of fencing required, the type and cost of same.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a blue print showing the 15 acre parcel on the Sechelt Reserve set aside by the members of the Band for the purposes of the school. The question of clearing this land will also have to stand over for future consideration.\n\nRelative to the erection of a chicken house, I beg to say that the Department will approve of having this work carried out. The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $275.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials, etc., in the above authorized work.\n\nRelative to the supplying of a drum for the washing machine, I beg to say that we are making enquiry from the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company, Toronto, and you will be advised later regarding this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

After the old drum was taken out we found that the outer casing was so badly rotted and worn away that it would be a waste of time to try to fit the new drum into it. I would therefore request from the Department of Indian Affairs a new casing. Much as I regret that we did not know the condition of this casing when we made our first demand but you will understand that it was impossible to see the interior of the casing till it was taken apart.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter dated September 29th last, No.167-14-5, the concluding paragraph of which pointed out that the Department was taking action in the direction of supplying a new drum for the washing machine at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, I beg to advise the Department that the drum was duly received and in view to payment therefor I am submitting herewith voucher No. 3515 attached to which is an account of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., Ltd., of Toronto, for the sum of $68.10 covering cost of the drum at $49.00, sales tax $1.47 and prepaid freight $18.63. The receipt for prepaid freight charge accompanies the accounts.\n\nI regret to inform the Department in this connection that a letter has been received from Reverend Principal J. McCaffrey, O.M.I., the original being herewith enclosed, setting forth that upon action being taken to install the drum, the outer casing was found to be badly rotted, a condition which the Reverend Principal states was impossible to see until the machine was taken apart. Principal McCaffrey does not offer any proposal as to how in making proper completion of these repairs but it has occurred to me to suggest that if the Company who supplied the drum has an agent or other connection in this city it might be best to have their representative go to Sechelt and thoroughly examine the machine with a view to completing the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a voucher in favour of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co.

In reply I beg to say that a cheque in payment of this account to the amount of $63.10 is being sent the above firm.\n\nI have also the communication which you forwarded from the Principal in which he states it was found, after the old cylinder was removed, that the outer casing of the washing machine was badly rotted and worn away, and requested that a new casing be supplied. If the firm who supplied the cylinder has an Agent in Vancouver, you may arrange with him to visit the Sechelt School and examine the machine, and submit an estimate of the cost of providing the new casing and any other equipment required in order to place the washing machine in a satisfactory condition. The quotation which you receive should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. It should be definitely stated therein the various parts that are required.\n\nIf there is no Agent of the above firm in Vancouver, the Principal should submit full information as to what equipment is required, giving, if possible, the catalogue or serial number, when we would take the matter up with the firm in Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As it is now, the stove can not draw and besides practically all the smoke enters the drying chamber to such an extent that it can not be used. It may be possible to procure a new lining for this stove or if not, a new fixture will have to be installed. The drier bears the mark \"Roberts Patent - Peck Williamson Co. Cincinnati, Ohio, 1898.\"\n\nThe only mark the Principal can find on the stove is the firm name and the mark \"5 - L.\"\n\nIt is possible that this drier and stove were installed new when the building was erected and that you may have on record the name of the firm which supplied the same. If so, I would thank you to be kind enough to take such action therein as you may deem advisable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"C.C. Perry\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.E.

C., Vancouver Agency.\n\nI have not a copy of the plans and specifications of this school in my office and I have, therefore, no knowledge as to just what was specified for in the way of a drying plant.

There is nothing here to show whether this machine was installed or whether one of another manufacture. There should be a plate somewhere on the dryer with the name of the manufacturer, or if the washer and extractor are from the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., in all probability the dryer is also. You can get this information by writing to the principal, and then write direct to the manufacturer for a new stove to replace the defective one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Indian Affairs,\n415 Winch Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sirs:- Attention Mr. C. C. Perry,\n\nWe are today in receipt of a letter from our Principals Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., to the effect that they can supply a new wood case for your washer complete with two end bands at $75.00, F.O.B. Toronto, subject to Sales Tax 2%.\n\nWe estimate that this case would weigh approximately three to four hundred pounds and you can figure roughly about $15.00 for Freight charges. This amount based on bringing the case in car-load from factory. You will understand that if it is brought forward local freight your freight charges will run very much higher.\n\nKindly advise your wishes at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVANCOUVER AGENCY,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C., March 9, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to Departmental letter No. 167-15-5, dated December 17th last, with reference to the purchase of a new outside casing to replace one that has become worn away at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. I now beg to report that as instructed I endeavored to get the local agents of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Ltd. to send a man to Sechelt to examine the machine and after considerable delay the firm pointed out that they may be able to obtain a quotation from the serial number, etc., supplied by the Reverend Principal. I have today received a letter from Messrs. Stanley Brock Ltd., Vancouver, representing the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Ltd., of Toronto, in this matter, the original being sent herewith for the Department's perusal and consideration. This letter will be self-explanatory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(G. C. Perry)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nVANCOUVER AGENCY.\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C., March 11, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to Departmental letter dated September 29th last, No. 167-18-5, in which authority was given by the Department for the expenditure of the sum of $80.00 for the repair of the flat roofs over the kitchen, laundry and boiler room at the Sechelt Indian Residential School and a further sum of $275.00 for the erection of a chicken house in connection with this school. I would inform the Department that after consulting with the Principal, Rev. J. McCaffrey, it was considered advisable on account of the very inclement weather to defer the carrying out of this work until a little later in the spring. I wrote a letter to the Principal on January 25th, pointing out that I would like to have this work finished before the end of the present Fiscal Year, but the Principal replied that on account of the then adverse weather conditions it was considered an unprompted time to carry out the work. Moreover the engineer at the school, Mr. Field, upon whom the Principal had counted to do this work, was so occupied that he could not promise the Principal any aid especially as the heating plant and engines impose a heavy duty upon him, therefore he could not see any likelihood of the work on the chicken house being begun, much less completed, before the end of the present month of March. The Principal regrets that this should be so but expresses the hope that the appropriation so kindly granted by the Department can be held in abeyance for more favorable conditions a little later.\n\nI would therefore request that, if possible, the appropriation for this work be extended beyond the end of the present Fiscal Year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(C. C. Perry)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 22, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant and note that it will be impossible for the Principal to arrange for the erection of the chicken house, etc., at the present time. Under the circumstances the Department approves of having the repairs made when local conditions will permit.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, regarding new outside casing required for the washer for the Sechelt School, you may purchase a new one from Stanley Brock Ltd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The cost should not be much, I should say about $25.00.\n\nI would recommend that this work be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(C. C.

In reply I beg now to advise the Department that I am informed by the Reverend Principal, J. McCaffrey, O. M. I., that this work has been completed by school employees, and it does not appear that the grant will now be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[C. C. Perry]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nKamloops, B.C., July 15th, 1929.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT VANCOUVER AGENCY No. 1.\n\nSECHELT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nThis school had broken up for the holidays and the Rev. Principal was away. However, one of the Brothers was in charge and took us around. I found the building in good order and well kept. Some of the plaster on the walls, however, requires renewing, as if this is not done soon, it is liable to spread and get worse. Here too, I found that the chemical extinguishers should be replenished and suggested their being emptied for training purposes. The fire alarm system in this school is inadequate, there not being enough bells. Some bells should certainly be placed over each dormitory door, and I wondered whether those bells that were in use for three years in the Girls' Wing at Kamloops Residential School might not be sent up there and installed as soon as the work of installing the new system at Kamloops is completed. Proper fire drill too, should be organized.\n\nThere is not much agricultural land available at this school, but the vegetable garden at this school is well kept and creditable. The Brother informed me that good potatoes were difficult to get and costly. I should think that Indian schools like St George's at Lytton, would be only too pleased to sell their surplus and by purchasing a carload they would not be costly, provided Sechelt school dug a potato cellar in which to store them. I will make enquiries to that effect.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Pragnell, in a report on his inspection of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, recommends that the chemical fire extinguishers be recharged. He suggests their being emptied of their present contents in training the pupils and staff in the handling of this equipment. I have, therefore, requested that you will arrange for the purchase of the new chemicals required to recharge these extinguishers. After these chemicals have been delivered at the school, you should arrange with the school authorities to discharge the present extinguishers with a view to showing the pupils and staff how this equipment should be used in case of fire. As soon as the extinguishers have been emptied, the new refills should be put in. Please forward a certified account, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of new refills. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nMr. Pragnell states that the fire alarm system at this school is inadequate, as there are not enough bells. He recommends that the bells that have been in use at the Kamloops School, but are not further required, be sent to the Sechelt School and installed over each dormitory door. We are requesting Mr. Inspector Pragnell to forward the bells to the Sechelt School and when they arrive you should arrange to have them properly installed. You may, if necessary, obtain the services of an electrician to do this work. When the work is completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that proper fire drill be carried out at this school, and you should have the school authorities arrange for the instruction of the pupils in fire drill, and, in future, these fire drills should be carried out at frequent intervals. You should see that these drills are satisfactorily carried out so that the pupils and staff will be thoroughly prepared should an emergency occur.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you later regarding the installing of the fire alarm gongs and the steps taken by the school authorities in carrying out proper fire drill.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\n415 Wych Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report on your inspection of the Sechelt Indian Residential School relative to the fire alarm system, it is noted you suggest that bells be placed over each dormitory door and recommend that the bells that were in use in the girls' wing at the Kamloops Residential School be sent to the Sechelt School and installed there as soon as the new system at Kamloops has been completed. The Department concurs in this arrangement, providing you are satisfied that the fire alarm gongs which were in use at Kamloops would be satisfactory at the Sechelt School.\n\nWhen the new fire alarm system at the Kamloops School is completed, you may arrange to have the fire gongs not now required there transferred to the Sechelt School. We are requesting the local Indian Agent to arrange, when the bells arrive at the Sechelt School, to have them properly installed over each dormitory door. Any expenditure you may incur in forwarding the bells to the Sechelt School will be paid upon receipt of an account, in duplicate, properly certified. I shall be pleased to hear as to the action taken in forwarding the old bells which are not required at Kamloops to the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Ferry,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReport on Indian School Sewage Disposal.\n\nPresent Conditions - Filter Bed not absorbing affluent from Septic Tank, as soil has become sealed up on account of grease, soap, etc. not being properly broken up in septic tank. Ground surrounding filter basin is water-logged or so filled with moisture as to prevent renewal of oxygen. Surface ditches have been dug outside the school boundary; these are in a very insanitary condition.\n\nCause of these conditions - Septic tank rather small for the number of persons accommodated by the system. Too much soap, grease, bleaches, or disinfectants used for the proper working of anaerobic bacteria, the disintegrating agency. Too much water on wash days, not allowing sufficient time in the septic tank, for the proper breaking up of the solids, and greasy matter, before same is discharged. Stone filter beds have not proved very satisfactory in the case of this school, for the ultimate disposal of the affluent, as the space between stones fills at course of time rendering the bed unable to take care of the discharge from the tank, which is of the intermitting syphon type, that several times each day discharges 897 gallons into the filter basin, so if the space between the stones cannot absorb this quantity it backs up in the pipe filling the septic tank, above the proper water level, thereby disturbing fluids in tank, and preventing the proper functioning of same. Nearly all the trouble is caused by the filter bed being unable to receive the full flow from the septic tank, on the instant of discharge, and the ultimate sealing up and water logging of the said basin.\n\nI have formulated three plans for the remedy or removal of these conditions. You will note that none of these are without objections. Plans No. Two and Three would be ideal in as far as the school is concerned and would be permanent.\n\nPlan No. One.\n\nConstruct a crate of rough heavy cedar five by sixteen by five feet, properly braced but with no bottom, but with a strong close cover, the whole to be buried eighteen inches below the surface of the ground, so the soil could be tilled above it. Connect crate to discharge of tank, with six inch vitrous pipe, and storm water drains with four inch vitrous pipe. Locate this crate a short distance from the present filter basin. This, I believe, would be satisfactory for from four to six years, after which it would necessary to renew and relocate.\n\nPlan No. Two\nPlan No. Two.\n\nConnect discharge of septic tank, with joints properly cemented for a distance of about nine hundred and fifty feet, to a pot hole, or a depression in the ground, said pot hole is located on the Indian Reserve, in North Westerly direction from the school, but unfortunately outside the school property, on the north side of the Government Road. It would be necessary to erect a rough log or other fence surrounding the discharge end of this pipe. This plan would in my opinion be the best to follow, if arrangements can be made with the Indian Council.\n\nPlan No. Three.\n\nWould be to pipe discharge to sea water, either on the front or to Porpoise Bay. This plan would be costly and would certainly raise a lot of opposition to discharging sewage into salt water so near to the summer resorts.\n\nWhatever plan is followed, the whole system should first be thoroughly cleaned out, and the septic tank restarted.\n\nTrusting this is the information desired.\n\nI am Yours truly,\n\nA.

Perry\nIndian Agent\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nIn regard to Mr. Tebb's solution of abatement of our sewerage nuisance, undoubtedly his plan No. 2 is the only feasible and practical plan. I would therefore urge that this plan be carried out.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nprincipal\nVANCOUVER AGENCY,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C., September 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to telegram of Mr. Indian Agent Perry to the Department dated May 20th, last as follows:-\n\n\"Sechelt Indian Residential School septic tank overflowing and should receive immediate inspection and attention. Please state if Engineer Tebb of Sechelt may do necessary work.\"\n\nalso to the Department's reply dated May 21st., viz:-\n\n\"Arrange with Tebb for inspection and attention septic tank Sechelt School.\"\n\nIn this matter I beg to say that on receipt of the Department's wire Mr. Agent Perry immediately communicated with Mr. Tebb and also with Rev. Principal McCaffrey. Unfortunately Mr. Tebb was engaged in other work and could not give immediate attention to the matter and as there was no other person at Sechelt qualified to submit engineer's report, Mr. Tebb's inspection and report were delayed until recently when a report was submitted by Mr. Tebb dated August 26th., original and copy of which are sent herewith.\n\nMr. Tebb was subsequently asked by Mr. Agent Perry to submit his estimate of the cost of plans numbered 1 and 2, respectively, eliminating plan No.3, which would have been objected to by the white people in the vicinity. Mr. Tebb has by letter dated September 15th., the original of which is also sent herewith, estimated the approximate cost of plan No.1 at $185.00 and plan No.2 at $505.00. Original letter dated September 3rd. signed by Reverend J. McCaffrey endorsing the carrying out of plan No.2 is also sent herewith.\n\nIt is recommended after discussion with Mr. Perry that plan No.2 be carried out as being the best means of eliminating the sewage difficulties at this school.\n\nI should point out, however, that the \"pot-hole\" referred to by Mr. Tebb may be found to be on the Sechelt Reserve No.2, beyond the limits of the recently surveyed 15 acres for the school but this point can be cleared up as soon as a visit can be made to Sechelt when the Council's consent might be obtained, should it be found that the area of sewage discharge is outside the school property.\n\nIn the meantime the Reverend Principal has been requested to take all possible steps to prevent entrance into the septic tank at present existing of too great a body of soapy water, etc., and the principal and his staff are endeavoring to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(A.O'N.Daunt)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 837-5, part 5)\nOct. 16, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the septic tank at the Seabolt School I would ask you to please make what arrangements you think necessary in accordance with Mr. Tobb's recommendation for the repairs and alterations to the septic tank and disposal field.

Father McCaffrey, Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School, that the roof of the school buildings be attended to during the dry season. The work necessary would be to scrape the moss from the shingles and re-stain them. I visited this school recently, and I consider the work should be done before next winter. I respectfully request advice as to whether I should obtain estimates of this cost.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/AC\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to removing the moss and restaining the shingles on the Sechelt Indian Residential School buildings. Please secure an estimate of the cost of this work and indicate in your reply how urgent the improvement is.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMay 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to advise that the principal of the above school, Rev. J. McCaffrey, O.M.I., has requested that a urinal be installed in the lavatory in the interest of sanitation.\n\nI visited the school recently and the need was most apparent, in fact I was surprised that the original plans failed to make provision for such a necessity.\n\nI respectfully request authority to have this work done and will personally see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in the installation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to installing a urinal in the lavatory at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that the Department has no funds available to provide the cost of supplying and installing this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n415 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nRe Your File No.167-18-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to staining and cleaning moss from the roof of Sechelt Indian School. The moss has become very thick on about 1500 sq.ft. of the roof, the total area of which is 10,338 sq.ft.\n\nThe Principal considers it would cost approximately $500.00 to scrape the moss and pay for stain and labour but he has valued the stain at $4.50 per gal. and covering 120 sq.ft. to the gallon. I have taken it up with the shingleen vendors here who state that 1 gal. should cover approximately 150 ft. and the cost of the shingleen in barrels in Vancouver $2.00 per gallon. Father McCaffrey's estimate is excessive as I am quite sure the complete job could be done for $350.00 including freight charges on shingleen from Vancouver. It is necessary that this work be done immediately while the school is closed, first to protect the shingles and avoid heavy expense of re-shingling, as it is 8 years since the shingling was done and unless protected will not last their full term. Sechelt is on an exposed part of the Coast, and high winds strike the school continually.\n\nThe principal reason for removing the moss is on account of fire risk. The moss is dry and inflammable and a spark from the chimney might start a fire at any time. This part of the work at least is urgent but it would not be economical to remove the moss without re-staining the shingles.\n\nI respectfully recommend that this work be done at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(P.J.C.Ball)\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nB/AC\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 28, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to staining and cleaning moss from the roof of the Sechelt Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost of the stain and labour. In this connection it is noted you estimate that the entire job, including the purchase of the stain required and the labour, could be done for approximately $350. This would include freight charges on the shingle stain from Vancouver.\n\nYou may arrange to have this work carried out at an early date. You should arrange for the purchase of the shingle stain. The school authorities should supply the labour, as far as possible, and, if possible, the entire cost should be kept within your estimate. Accounts in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the cost of the materials and for the labour it is necessary to employ.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The linoleum in use at present is badly worn and has been in use for eight years. There are large holes in it and none of it is of any use.\n\nThe Principal has requested that a good quality of linoleum be supplied and local merchants quote prices on Battleship linoleum 3 feet wide from $1.50 to $2.45 per square yard. The Principal's request for 3-1/2 foot width would make too much waste, as this linoleum is made in 6 feet widths. The medium linoleum, which is about the same as that in use at present is $1.95 per square yard. The linoleum in use at present is worn from the edges and this could be avoided by having brass edging laid for protection at a cost of 15\u00a2 per foot. The total cost would, therefore, be $199.50, plus freight.\n\nI do not know whether the School authorities should supply this, or whether it is furnished by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.G.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVancouver Indian Agency,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n415 Winch Bldg.,\nJuly 21, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School, Rev.

Tebb, at Sechelt, and in your letter of the 29th of January you advised Mr. Daunt to arrange to have the work proceeded with. In accordance with your letter, this was put off until after the 31st of March, and it was later decided to wait until school closed. Mr. Tebb is prepared to commence the work immediately, but it is found that his estimate of $500.00 is too low, the difference being in the cost of the vitreous pipe. Under Plan Two it will be necessary to lay 950 feet of pipe at 33\u00a2 per foot\u2014the best price obtainable so far. This will bring the estimate to approximately $800.00.\n\nI would appreciate telegraphic instructions as to whether we should go ahead with the work. The cost will be kept as low as possible and I have already been over the ground with Mr. Tebb.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School for materials to carry out repairs at the school. In reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the materials as mentioned in your letter, with the exception of the window glass. The Department does not supply window glass, as repairs to windows should be carried out by the school authorities and the cost of same provided from per capita grant earnings or other receipts.\n\nI have also your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the request of the Principal to be supplied with linoleum for use in the corridors at the school.

It was expected that considerable blasting\nof stumps would have to be done and rock removed or cut through,\nbut this was almost entirely avoided accounting for a far\nless cost of construction than could possibly have been expected\nin this locality.

There has been some delay about obtaining analysis of the milk and water used by the School but neither is considered by the medical officer and others to have been the cause.\n\nI am having the sewage disposal system checked up for possible trouble as the Principal says there is a distinct odour in the basement.\n\nThe children at this school are not clean and I consider the lack of bathing facilities responsible. There are forty girls and forty boys usually in attendance and each section has two baths, one a small one for infants and two toilets. There should be installed as soon as possible six shower baths for each section. These could be installed very cheaply, the woodwork would be done by the school and the plumbing would be a simple matter. They do not need any elaborate fixtures\u2014merely a row of sprinklers with valves. I am advised that at present there is so much congestion at bathing time that two use the same water. I was surprised to hear it and consider it disgraceful. Shower baths would take care of six at a time and would be infinitely more sanitary, and quicker.\n\nI would recommend therefore that these fixtures be installed at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 21st, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to a recent outbreak of typhoid at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. It is hoped that no further cases have developed and that the cause of this outbreak has been ascertained. Both the milk and water supply, as well as the sewage disposal system, should be thoroughly checked.\n\nRegarding the lack of bathing facilities, I have to request that you will secure an estimate of the cost of installing shower baths for the boys and girls. It is noted that any woodwork required could be done by the school and that the plumbing would be a simple matter. When the Department has full information regarding the cost of the fixtures and the plumbing work required in installing same, consideration will then be given as to whether or not this work can be authorized. Your early reply, giving the information requested, would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSelma Park,\nSechelt, B.C.,\nMarch 16, 1931.\n\nF.J.C.Ball, Esq.,\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr.Ball,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th inst., No.1665, would say I have been to the School and find the outlet sewer is working perfectly and you can rest assured that this piece of work will not, at any time, give you any trouble.\n\nI also inspected the sanitary installation in the basement and find on the boys' side there is considerable odour due to urine on the floor. Now I do not wish to imply that it is due to want of cleanliness on the part of anyone of the staff. There used to be a urinal for the boys but this is not there anymore and there are only two closets for forty boys which in my opinion is not enough. There is always a grand rush, when classes are dismissed or play is over and no doubt a good deal of jostling and a large amount goes on the floor. One of the closets was found partly choked by some obstruction in trap discharge orifice. This the Principal is having the engineer clear to-day by taking up bowl and clearing and resetting. I also found considerable leakage from the closet tanks either from a worn douglass float or for want of a new washer on intake valves, but covers of tanks were nailed down, no doubt to keep the children from interfering with the mechanism, so I was unable to determine which. This leakage results in only about a half flush and is not enough to insure proper clearing of the bowl. There is also the matter of newspaper being used and sometimes in such large pieces to cause the bowl to overflow by clogging the outlet. This happened yesterday. There was a large piece of paper in bowl and when I flushed it, it clogged for a few seconds, but finally passed through. There are no wood seats on any of the closets in the basement. One bowl has the rim broken.\n\nOn the girls' side there are three closets, but one is not in commission being broken and the water turned off. This side is clean. There is no odour. I certainly think that a battery of urinals or more closets should be installed on the boys' side, and a new closet to replace the broken one on the girls' side of basement.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A.R.Tebb.\nRe Typhoid Fever at Sechelt Residential School.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report further in connection with the outbreak of typhoid fever at Sechelt Residential School which I reported upon March 13th instant. The water has been found pure and the sewage disposal system is working perfectly. I mentioned in my letter of the 13th the uncleanly condition of the boys and also some parts of the school. These are matters for stricter supervision by the Principal, the Rev.Father Mailhard, and the responsibility is entirely his own; even if there are inadequate sanitary facilities.\n\nOn May 26, 1930, I wrote you asking if a urinal could be installed at the school as the principal then, the Rev.Father McCaffrey, found it extremely difficult to keep the lavatories clean, but in your letter of June 2nd, File 167-18-5, this was refused. Under date of March 13th, I asked for permission to have shower baths installed and I now enclose a copy of a letter from Mr.A.R.Tebb, of Sechelt, which explains the necessity for further lavatory accommodation.\n\nI may add that the School authorities are of the opinion that effluvia from these lavatories caused the typhoid, but medical opinion does not support such contention.\n\nI respectfully request authority to have the lavatory accommodation repaired and enlarged to meet the needs of the School and an inexpensive set of showers installed at the same time. The principal of the Provincial Industrial School for Boys made a strong complaint that three boys committed to his institution recently from the Sechelt School arrived there in a filthy condition and this does not redound to the credit of the School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.G.Bell]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 387-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1746 of the 21st instant, with reference to sanitary conditions at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. You may repair the lavatories and have an inexpensive set of showers installed. I regret our funds are such that we cannot authorize additional lavatory accommodation, with the exception of an inexpensive urinal for the boys' side. The Department relies on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nI note that there has been a complaint from the Provincial Industrial School concerning the condition of some of the boys who were committed from Sechelt. I am writing to Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn, asking for a report in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n319 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMr. F. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nYour letter of the 20th and enclosed copy of a communication from Dr. Inglis came to hand last Saturday, as you mentioned that you had requested the Doctor to call on me to discuss his complaint. I have not answered more promptly; to the present time I have not seen Dr. Inglis though I believe he has been to Sechelt twice recently. I have been to point where discharge takes place, and while there is odor distinguishable inside the enclosure, but is not noticeable at any great distance from the said enclosure, and the conditions are not comparable to conditions prevailing for a number of years within 70 feet of class rooms and the boys dormitory; now, the present point of complaint is approximately 500 feet distant from the school, across the Government Road and there is not any other building as close as the school is, except the stable.\n\nHowever, if this open discharge is considered a menace to health or otherwise objectionable a rock and gravel filter bed could be constructed at the outlet, or better still a rough crate like box built of 2x6 cedar with joints spaced 1 inch apart at sides and ends, no bottom, and a close top, this would need be 3 feet wide 3 feet deep by 40 feet long placed under ground and covered by a foot of earth. I would recommend the box first on account of cost, and also from the danger of a filter bed to overflow at point where the sewer enters.\n\nRegarding the tile drain method of treating the effluent, mentioned by the Doctor. This method was recommended by Portland Cement interests, for farm and suburban homes, but has never been extensively used as the plot on which the tiles are laid must have a lower level than the outlet of the septic tank because they will not function if laid more than 20\" to 24 inches below the surface of the ground, so that it was impossible to adopt this system at the School as the septic tank is placed, and necessarily so, at about the lowest point on the school grounds. The tank is of the intermitting syphon discharge type, with the outlet six feet below the ground level; it would be impractical to install the Drain Tile system at the end of the new drain instead of the filter bed or filter box above mentioned but the cost as it would require, in order to absorb the amount flow from this system 60,000 feet of 4\" drain tile or 40,000 of 6\" tile, which with the laying etc. would be a very expensive piece of work.\n\nA rough estimate of the cost of the filter bed, and filter box, without getting actual figures on material would be Rock and Gravel Filter Bed $300.00 Box Filter $180.00\n\nNow for a little history of the attempts to adequately take care of the effluent from the sewerage system of this school, as you were not stationed here at the time it may be interesting for you to know what has been done in this matter; when the school was built in 1921 the plans called for Filter Basin 12 feet in diameter at the top 8' at bottom and 6 ft. deep placed 50 feet south of septic tank, this by myself the general contractors, and plumbing contractors was considered too small,\n\nso....\nwithout extra cost to the Department, it was installed 14 feet diameter at top 8 feet at bottom and 10 feet deep. The School was opened in the summer of 1922, and before the next spring sewage was laying on the surface of the ground. I still was of the opinion that this condition was brought about because the filter basin was yet too small for the service, so I recommended to the Department that one be installed 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep, this was done and for three or four years gave good service; then again sewage made its appearance on the surface of the ground and from that time on it has been a perfect seep pool a few yards from the school building until the new outlet sewer was put in last August, at which time the sewage had formed a lake 40 feet long 10 feet wide and 2 feet deep in the center, there also was a ditch outside of the school property, on the Indian Reserve, which also was full this at over flowed and ran down toward the Indian village.\n\nThe septic tank had ceased to function so a large amount of this was crude sewage, the main sewer of the school was full to the school building endangering the whole system.\n\nNow the new effluent discharge pipe has been put in, carrying the waste to a lower level we find the septic tank again functioning, and it is an impossibility for the waste matter to back up and prevent it so doing, or endangering the school sewer, but there is bound to be some odour at the outlet, but not to be compared with the conditions which had prevailed on the school grounds for years previous to this installation. The next time you are in Sechelt I would like to go over the ground with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A. R. Tebb.\nVictoria, B.C.,\nApril 10, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith the report of Nurse Gerry who is attached to Vancouver and New Westminster Indian Agencies, for the month of March, ultimo, together with copy of Mr. Agent Ball's covering letter, also of Mr. A.R.

He states that the storage tank held only ten inches of water this week and that by summer the situation will be worse. The main trouble is in the condition of the system between the intake from the creek and the storage tank. Father Mallard advises me that when he saw you in Ottawa immediately before he left to take charge of the School, you told him the water system at the School was going to be fixed up and that you already had a report on it from the Dominion Water Power Branch. This report will probably show that the intake is about two and one-half miles from the tank and consists of a wooden catch-basin at the intake and lengths of pipe and flume from intake to tank. The catch-basin has rotted and leaks badly and the pipes and flumes are also in poor shape. There is ample water if properly carried to the School. From the tank to the School, the system is in good order.\n\nWill you kindly advise whether you have full particulars of these matters, and also whether the Department intends to have the works renewed in the near future?\n\nShould full details be required, I could go over the system and report to you, but Mr. Webb, of the Water Power Branch, advises me that they reported on this water system some time ago.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 837-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1289 of the 8th instant with reference to the Sechelt Indian Residential School water supply. It is true that we have full reports from the Dominion Water Power Branch in this connection. To repair or replace the catch basin and pipes and flumes would be quite an expensive undertaking, and, as our funds are extremely limited, the Department wishes to give careful consideration.\n\nI may say that consideration is now being given to the proposal to extend the pipeline in the Indian village. There has been correspondence with the Dominion Water Power Branch and with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in this connection. Would this extension mean that more water still is required and that the situation, as far as the school is concerned, would be aggravated? An early reply is requested, with your opinion concerning the possibility of having the repairs or replacements stand over until funds can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n619 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nEXTRACT from Report of G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, on his inspection of the SECHELT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, on May 19 & 20, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 167-18-6.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nThis is from a spring about 2\u00bd miles from the school. The water is piped to the school and to the Indian Village. The water is good but the supply is limited, particularly in summer. The Indians in the village are reported to be leaving the taps open. Some of the water runs away. During July, August and September the school is without sufficient water. During these months, there is no pressure in the pipes sufficient for fire fighting. There is no water available at that season for irrigation.\n\nI would recommend that, as soon as possible, the school be connected with the main water pipe of the Union Estates. This pipe runs near the school, and as far as I can learn, there is abundance of water in this pipe line at all times of the year. This would give proper fire protection to the school.\n\nEXTRACT from Letter of W.E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner for B.C., dated June 5, 1931, forwarding above Report.\n\nOriginal on File 167-18-6.\n\nIn connection with the water supply mentioned by Capt. Barry, I beg to say that I have asked Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, to negotiate with the Union Estates of Vancouver in the matter of obtaining a reasonable rate for the Department tying into their large domestic water system which was only installed a couple of years ago. This matter will be reported upon at a later date at which time an estimate will also be given as to what the cost will be for the laying of the necessary main from the Union Estates pipeline to the school.\nFire Protection:\n\nThere are two wooden fire escapes. Outside the building, there is one fire hydrant with hose. In the summer months, neither the supply of water nor the pressure would be sufficient to make this hydrant of any practical use. The same remark applies to the three stand pipes (one on each floor) inside the building. There are 18 chemical extinguishers inside the building. With these, a small fire might be fought. The door from the small girls' dormitory to the fire escape is kept locked. The key to this door is in the supervisor's room. The big girls pass through the supervisor's room to the escape. The door to the supervisor's room is not locked. I held a fire drill while inspecting the school. The children were in their classrooms, etc. I was not very satisfied with the results of this drill. The children were clear of the building in less than sixty seconds; but they did not walk out in an orderly manner. Some ran, which is a very bad practice during any sort of fire drill. The Principal explained this by saying that the children were happy. I still do not think that they should be permitted to run at fire drill.\n\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nThe wash rooms were perfectly clean. In the kitchen, which was also clean, the wall tiles are much worn. It looks to me as if very inferior material was used here when the school was built. The girls' toilets seem to be in good condition. The boys' toilet in the basement was not in satisfactory condition. There are only two toilets here for 35 boys. One of these toilets was completely blocked up. The Principal informs me that this particular toilet bowl keeps on blocking. There is nothing wrong with the drain as the other bowl flushes properly. There is also great need for a urinal in this boys' basement. I took this matter up with the Indian Agent, who informs me that he has arranged for the clearing of the toilet bowl and the installation of urinals. He had been working on this matter previous to my visit to the school.\n\nThe boys' recreation room might, I consider, be kept much cleaner. There is plaster off the wall due to the kicking of balls about the room. I do not consider that the Department should be called on to pay for repairs to the walls when proper supervision would make such a condition impossible.\n\nThe bitumastic top has worn off the cement in the girls' basement. There are only two bath tubs on each side of the school. I understand from Mr. Indian Agent Ball that he has arranged for the installation of six shower baths on each side of the school. Some large cracks have developed in the wall of the boys' infirmary.\n\nThe linoleum of the corridors is much worn. The Principal asks for 65 yards of plain brown Battleship Linoleum 3 ft. wide. I do not consider that the need for this is very urgent, when the funds of the Department are so badly needed for urgent matters.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the Sechelt water system.\n\nIn compliance with your instructions, I am now forwarding full particulars. In January last Mr. Ditchburn sent me a copy of the Dominion Water Power Branch's report dated January 7, 1931, upon the extension of the system, and as the Sechelt Band had asked for this extension several years ago, I asked Mr. Ditchburn to recommend it. Because of the situation which has developed since that time regarding the shortage of funds and in view also of the partial breakdown of the whole water system, I beg to withdraw the recommendation to extend the present system.\n\nThe Department is aware that the Union Estates constructed their water system through the Indian Reserve at Sechelt without payment for the privilege but the understanding seems to have been that at some future time they would supply the School and Reserve with water at a price to be agreed upon, but no definite arrangement was made. Instead of incurring the expense of replacing or repairing our system, I would suggest that if we can so arrange, we tap the Union Estates line from one of the T's placed in position for that purpose and supply the School from that source, leaving all other water in the present system for the Indians. We have on file an estimate of $1,623.00 for material and labour to construct a six inch wood stave pipe from the Company's system to the School with three hydrants and 150 feet of hose for each hydrant. With steel pipe the cost would be $800.00 more but with only two hydrants instead of three. This would cover cost of construction only; we would still have to arrange with the Union Estates. I understand that their system cost about $23,000.00 and they will ask for proportion of this amount and upkeep. This proportion was estimated at that time to be $3,850.00 so that on this basis our total cost for the School would be $5,473.00. Major Harold Brown is out of town but as soon as he returns I have an appointment with him and can give you further information as to the Company's views.

I find in a report by Mr. Matthew Balls that the cost of renewing the whole existing system, both school and reserve, would be between $12,000.00 and $15,000.00.\n\nThe Department would no doubt decide whether part or all of the cost of supplying water to the School constitutes a charge against the school appropriation.

Webb, of the Dominion Water Power Branch. Major Brown is willing to sell us water for $100.00 per annum for the School and asks no other compensation. This is an exceedingly satisfactory offer, no mention being made of maintenance, etc. Of course we must make our own connections from their system to the School and I respectfully request that this pipe line be constructed as per the figures shown in my letter of the 8th instant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRe: Water Supply, Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nI have to inform you that this morning, in company with Mr. Indian Agent Ball, I had an interview with Mr. Harold Brown, General Manager of the Union Steamship Co., with reference to Indian participation in the water supply system of the Union Estates Ltd. at Sechelt which passes through the Indian Reserve.\n\nMr. Brown at that interview stated that his company would supply water for domestic and fire fighting purposes for the Indian School at a flat rate of $100 per year, it being understood that the Department of Indian Affairs would bear the expense of all connections necessary from the Union Estates system.\n\nSo far as the school is concerned, I think this is a very equitable and satisfactory offer on the part of Mr. Brown. So far as irrigation at the school is concerned, I think it would be advisable, for the present at least, to obtain the irrigation supply from the existing Indian system, the Indian village being deserted during most of the summer months when water is required for irrigation.\nOffice of Indian Agent,\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver B.C.\nJune 13, 1931.\n\nYour File 30/14/20033.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn January 26th last I wrote you with reference to the Sechelt water system, asking you to recommend an extension in the village of that system.\n\nSince that time, the situation has changed completely because there is an apparent breakdown in the pipe line from the intake to the school tank as Father Maillard reports there is only 1-1/2 feet of water in the tank and very little coming into it. The pipes, flumes and box at the intake are in disrepair and it would mean a heavy outlay to replace it. The Department wrote me for particulars, and I have suggested to them that we connect with the Union Estates pipe-line for the school supply and turn all the water from the existing system into the village pipes. This would be ample for the village needs for some time and the school would then have a proper supply with fire protection. There is an estimate on file of $1,623.60 for this work with three hydrants and hose, construction being of woodstave pipe. If steel pipe is used the cost is given as $800.00 extra with two hydrants instead of three.\n\nRegarding the supply of water, I made an appointment with Major Brown of the Union Estates and with Mr. C. E. Webb talked the matter over with him. Major Brown offers us water for the School for $100.00 per annum which you will agree is most reasonable. I reported this to the Department recommending that the work be done and Major Brown's offer accepted.\n\nMr. Webb advised me that you have written him authorizing the extension to the village system. If this can be done in addition to the school job so much the better, but if only one job can be done, I consider the school work of far greater importance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Fredk. J.C.

June 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Water Supply, Sechelt Indian School\n\nFurther to my letter of January 17, 1931, I have at the request of Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn taken up with the Union Estates Ltd. the question of supplying the above mentioned school with a water supply for domestic use and fire protection. They have agreed to provide such a supply for the school at a charge of $100. per year, any connection charges or pipeline installation to be borne by the school. The proposed arrangement does not include the Indian village.\n\nIt would appear that the acquisition of such a supply will provide the most desirable solution of the water problems at Sechelt and will permit of the development of the present system supplying the school for the use of the Indian village along the lines suggested in my letter of January 17th.\n\nThe cost of an extension of the Union Estates pipeline to serve the school was estimated at $2400. but may be, at present, constructed for approximately $2800. see attached estimate.\n\nA supply of water for the school such as the Union Estates are willing to provide at almost a nominal fee appears to be a very favorable concession on their part which I am sure will be fully appreciated by the Department of Indian Affairs and will no doubt be accepted when circumstances permit.\n\nEnc.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom.Water Power & Hydro.Bureau\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to my letter of January 23rd regarding the proposed extension of the water supply system to supply the Sechelt Indian school and village, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Webb, together with an estimate of the cost of an extension from the supply constructed by Union Estates, Ltd., to serve the school amounting to $2,200.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn the past, the Sechelt Indian Residential School and the contiguous Indian village have secured water from a wooden stave pipe. The system has not been very satisfactory, particularly in the summer months, when the supply is very limited. In addition, the pipe is constantly in need of repairs. At the present time, under authority of P.C. 130/1118, of May 16th, 1920, is being expended from Band Funds for the purpose of extending the system to additional homes on the reserve.\n\nFor some years, the Department has known the desirability of securing a better supply for the Sechelt School. The Union Estates, in 1929, provided a splendid water supply system for their property at Selma Park and for the village of Sechelt. Their water main for Sechelt passes through the Indian village. The easement to the Company was granted by the Indians gladly, on the understanding that, at some future date, we should be granted the privilege of connecting with the water system for the Indian village and for the residential school.\n\nThe Union Estates have offered water to the Sechelt Indian Residential School for an annual charge of $100. Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer, of the Dominion Water Power, consider this a most favourable proposition, and, as a suitable supply for the school is now a matter of real urgency, it is strongly recommended that we tie on to the Union Estates system. The school would secure a domestic water supply and outside fire protection by hydrants.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch has estimated the cost of connecting up with a 6 inch steel pipe at $2,193.50. This amount can be charged to the miscellaneous item in the Indian Education Vote, in which there remains approximately $5,000 unassigned. I shall be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, July 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2543-W \"A\" of the 19th ultimo, with enclosure from Mr. Webb, with reference to arrangements that have been made with the Union Estates, Limited, to supply water to the Sechelt Indian Residential School for domestic use and fire protection. In view of Mr. Webb's recommendation, the Department has decided to proceed with the scheme, the cost of which has been estimated at $2,193.50. Will you please instruct Mr. Webb accordingly and inform him that, upon application, an accountable cheque will be directed to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 30/14/21547 of the 16th ultimo, with enclosures, with reference to the water supply for the Sechelt Indian Residential School. I note, with satisfaction, that the Union Estates Limited, have offered a connection with their system for the use of the school only, at a flat rate of $100 per year. The Department has decided to proceed with the scheme, and instructions are today being directed to the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch. In due course, he will instruct Mr. Webb. The annual fee will have to be paid by the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, July 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your 2238 of the 8th ultimo and your 2269 of the 10th ultimo, with reference to the advisability of securing water for the Sechelt Indian Residential School from the Union Estates, Limited.\n\nI have now to inform you that the Department is today writing to the Dominion Water Power Branch, asking them to proceed with the work, at an estimated cost of $2,193.50. The annual charge of $100 for water will have to be paid by the school management. Will you please inform the school that the work is being proceeded with and that they will be expected to pay the $100 per year. This will be a comparatively inexpensive water supply for the school, as they will have no pumping or other costs to meet. Will you please inform the manager of the Union Estates, Limited, that the Department is accepting his offer and we are proceeding with the connecting up to his system without delay. Inform him, also, that the school will meet the $100 per year rate and that he should bill the Rev. Principal. You may inform him, further, however, that the Department will guarantee payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. H. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C.

The purchase was not authorized and Father Maillard has requested me to report the circumstances in support of his claim.\n\nI regret to say the School had been allowed to become dilapidated under previous management and Father Maillard asked for authority to have it painted and varnished throughout. I advised him funds were not available and he insisted it must be done for hygienic reasons. Just before school closed he commenced on the work and everyone, including the sisters and pupils were kept diligently employed in scraping, varnishing and painting from top to bottom and I am pleased to say that the whole school is now a credit to the Department.\n\nEvery bed in the school was taken apart, washed in lysol, scraped and enamelled and looks as good as new. All walls are painted with a washable paint and floors scraped and varnished. Every desk was scraped, sanded, painted and varnished and I admit they were particularly dirty. Lavatories, wash-rooms, etc., were also treated with lysol and painted or white-washed and the school when it closed for vacation was absolutely clean, sanitary and wholesome.\n\nOnly one room\u2014the boys' playroom in the basement\u2014was untouched. This was walled with gyproc or similar material and has been broken into small pieces. It needs a lumber finished interior instead of a brittle substance as used and to do this work $40.00 worth of plain lumber is required.\n\nI have been particularly pleased with the great improvements made by Father Maillard at this school recently and it reflects much credit upon him and his staff.\n\nI hope this account for the paint will be refunded to him, the labour has been given free and to have had the work done privately would have cost many times the amount.\n\nB/HM.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed account, in duplicate, to the amount of $5.00, has been received from the office of the Chief Inspector of Boilers, Vancouver, covering the cost of inspecting the boilers at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.

Ferrier, sq.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nReferring to our conversation of this afternoon, the following extracts from Father Maillard letter will give you an idea of his point of view:\n\n\"Can really the Dept. expect me to run this School on the meagre pittance of $12.00 a month. This school is the entire property of the Indian Dept. Why not put it on the same footing as the Lytton School, where salaries are paid by the Dept as well as the current expenses. Really Mr. Ferrier should take into consideration the special conditions of Sechelt School.\"\n\nFather Maillard seems to be under the impression that at Lytton School the Government pays all the expenses of the School as well as the salaries of employees and of the Principal. Personally I do not think that this is the case and I have told him so.\n\nI believe that the important points worth considering are the absence of any farm land and the high cost of transportation of all freight from Vancouver. Perhaps the Dept. could take these two points into consideration.\n\nI have told Father Maillard that it would make matters far easier for you if he could patch up his differences with Mr. Ball.\n\nIf he decides to write to you about the general situation at the schools, you might find an opportunity of speaking about the necessity of co-operation and of strict conformity to the regulations of the Dept. I would like to avoid making any direct criticism myself unless it should be absolutely necessary to do so.\n\nI saw Inspector Fatt and found him very kind and obliging.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer further to your 4219 of April 28th, last, concerning improvements at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. The Superior of the English Oblates of Canada has recently visited Ottawa and has reminded the Department of the difficulties of current financing at this school. The unsuitability of the land for farming purposes and the extra transportation costs are the reasons advanced why special consideration should be given. With this viewpoint, you might have further discussion with Rev. Father Maillard. Pursuant to this, if there are any recommendations you can make, please report to the Department. It should be kept in mind, however, that the funds at our disposal this year are extremely limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n522 Metropolitan Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report on his inspection of the SECHELT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on April 19th, 20th and 21st, 1932. - Original on File 167-18-6.\n\nI strongly recommend that the following be authorized in order that the above Manual Training class may complete the work on their own shop and do some very necessary repairs before the end of the fine weather this summer:\n\nShingles for wood shed, implement shed, and manual training shop.\n32000 shingles, 100 pounds galvanized shingle nails - 1 1/8 in.\n1200 ft. 1 inch by 8 inches shiplap.\n\nI believe that it would be perfectly proper to charge this to our Special Vote as most of it is for the Manual Training class and the remainder will be used by the class in doing practical and very necessary repairs.\n\nDuring the year, the boys have painted the interior of the rooms on the boys' side. This includes the dormitories and classrooms on this side. They have started on the girls' side but have not the necessary paint. The school asks for a grant of $75.00 for the necessary paint to finish the work. I most strongly recommend this. Much money has been saved to the Department by having the boys do this work and it is splendid training for them.\n\nThe barn is in a satisfactory state of repair, although it badly needs a new coat of paint. This may perhaps be put off for another year, as we are so short of money.\n\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nIn the boys' basement the recreation room reported in poor condition last year still has plaster off the walls and windows broken. The Principal informs me that he has the lumber necessary for the repairs to this room; but that the necessary work is far too big a job for the Manual Training Class to undertake. I agree with him in this. In my opinion, it will be necessary to employ an experienced carpenter to complete this work. The damage to this recreation room was caused by boys from the village for the most part, and occurred before the present Principal took charge of the school. I still do not consider that the Department should be called on to pay for the repairs to this room. The damage was obviously caused by lack of proper supervision.\n\nLaundry\nLaundry:- There are five double enamelled tubs, one rotary washing machine, one extractor and one hot air drier. A new heater for the laundry drier is urgently required. The present heater is now worn out. It is a Number 24 Peck Williamson Co. Cincinnati model. It is possible that some other form of heater made in Canada would be just as good. The heater supplies hot air to the drier, and is made to fit the hot air intake. I do not think that the Principal's idea of turning an old bakery, which has never been used as such, into a \"Dry Room\" is a satisfactory substitute and I prefer to recommend the supply of another heater as mentioned above.\n\nI recommend that the school be given lumber, cement, and paint, sufficient for the construction of a modern chicken house 60 ft. by 15 ft. The materials would cost about $250.00 at the wharf at Sechelt, and the boys of the Manual Training class could erect the house under the direction of the Manual Training Instructor. As funds are so urgently required for several other recommendations made in this report, it might be better to leave this particular item till next year; but I do not wish the Department to take it from this that such a building is not necessary, as I am only suggesting that, owing to the lack of funds it may not be possible to do things that are badly wanted.\n\nElectric Light:- An electric light bulb should be placed on each landing of the fire escapes. Teachers should have electric torches at hand in case the lighting system broke down during a fire. It is very dangerous to practice Fire Drills at night without some light on the wooden fire escapes. Repairs were necessary on the lighting plant during the past year. A short circuit burned out a resistance coil and a number of fuse boxes (?) The repairs cost $96.00 and were done by the Jarvis Electric Co. of Vancouver. This is one of the necessary expenses which I consider the Department might well bear the cost of, and which I would recommend that the school be reimbursed for. The electric light plant appears now to be working properly.\n\nEXTRACT from Commissioner Ditchburn's Letter of June 6, 1932, enclosing above report. - Original on File 167-18-6.\n\nWhen inspecting this school Captain Barry came to the conclusion that certain things were needed in the way of material for shingling the woodshed, implement shed and manual training room, as well as shiplap to complete the sheeting up of the inside of the manual training room; thirty mattresses were also recommended for the dormitories.\n\nHe also made recommendations in regard to the repayment to the Principal of moneys spent by him in the purchase of a horse and harness, repairs to the electric lighting plant, etc. Apparently the Principal applied to Mr. Indian Agent Ball for the materials mentioned and repayment of funds expended. Agent Ball informs me that the Department had refused to authorize the expenditure in connection with the shingles, etc., as well as the mattresses, but I may say of course the Department was not aware of the School Inspector's report in connection with the several items.\nCOPY\n\nFor Information of\n\nVery Rev. W. Byrne Grant, O.M.I.\n\nOttawa, June 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer further to your 4219 of April 28th, last, concerning improvements at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. The Superior of the English Oblates of Canada has recently visited Ottawa and has reminded the Department of the difficulties of current financing at this school. The unsuitability of the land for farming purposes and the extra transportation costs are the reasons advanced why special consideration should be given. With this viewpoint, you might have further discussion with Rev. Father Maillard. Pursuant to this, if there are any recommendations you can make, please report to the Department. It should be kept in mind, however, that the funds at our disposal this year are extremely limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J.-C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n322 Metropolitan Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the Sechelt Residential School Principal's application for various improvements at the School.\n\nFather Maillard took up this matter recently with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and I wrote him giving the following list of what has been done recently for Father Maillard, and I consider the Department has been quite liberal when funds are so limited:\n\n1. Roof repaired and re-painted ------------ $454.60,\n2. Water system connected with Union Estates system, fire hydrants and hose supplied ----------------- $1,830.12,\n3. Sewage disposal works constructed ------- $566.90,\n4. Playground levelled and enlarged --------- $1,412.22,\n5. Manual training installed ------------------ $335.31,\n6. Paint supplied for interior work -------- $154.12,\n7. Paid $186.75 hospital expenses of tonsil operations unauthorized by Dept. also grant to the M.O. for the work of about --------------------- $200.00,\n8. Paid for dentistry work for pupils ------ $287.00,\n9. Paid Medical Officer for special examination of the children ------------------ $50.00,\n10. Paid for installing shower baths, new urinals, etc. at school ------------------ $490.27,\n11. Lumber supplied for playroom ------------ $50.00,\n12. Fire bells installed ---------------------- $37.20,\n13. Fares are paid for children going to hospital and Dept. will consider reasonable accounts for their travelling expenses home. Paid in June, 1931, ----- $13.00, (No record kept of these items).\n14. Offer made to purchase one cow if Principal would purchase one. Not accepted although offered a year ago.\n15. Unlimited drugs ------------------------ $6,087.49.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\nThe following requests were made either to me or to Mr. Ditchburn, the Principal erroneously complaining that I am preventing him from obtaining them.\n\n1. Shingles for the woodshed, implement shed, manual training room etc.\n2. Shiplap, nails, galvanized iron, place not specified,\n3. 30 mattresses to replace worn ones in use at present.\n4. Fares to hospital of pupils going to Vancouver for treatment.\n5. Payment to and from their reserves of pupils going home (presumably for holiday).\n6. Payment of hospital accounts and other expenses of pupils sent to Vancouver without authority for tonsil operations.\n7. Re-payment to the Principal for a horse and harness.\n8. Repayment of repairs to electric light plant.\n9. Repayment of fares travelling expenses, etc., paid last year taking children back to school from holidays.\n10. A new wagon for the school.\n11. New chicken houses.\n12. A launch for school use.\n13. Two milch cows.\n14. Linoleum throughout the corridors.\n\nThere are others which have escaped my memory for the time being, but the Principal is insatiable.\n\nWith regard to No. 4, I have already advised Father Maillard that the Department pays such fares and we have done so. I do not know why this is included in his list to Mr. Ditchburn.\n\nNo. 5 will also be given attention if accounts are sent to me for any children travelling by public conveyance. Most of them are taken home by their parents.\n\nNo. 6 has already been dealt with by the Department.\n\nNo. 13\u2014The Department offered to purchase one cow if Father Maillard would purchase the other, but this offer has never been accepted.\n\nNo. 12 was never recommended and is totally unnecessary.\n\nNo. 14 was recommended to you and refused.\n\nFruit and vegetables are grown at the School and there......\nthere is ample room for chicken raising, but the soil is not good. Wholesale prices of flour, meat and all other commodities are the lowest for years and Father Maillard's predecessor managed the school when prices were considerably higher, and never referred to it as a \"poverty stricken school\" as Father Maillard does continually. If he can not run this school on the allowance granted, the solution would be to find a Principal who can. We have spent over $6,000.00 in something over one year in improvements at this fairly new school. The other Residential School in this Agency is a very old structure and should have consideration ahead of Sechelt in future. If the Department is unable to provide funds for the whole list of fourteen items shown above, I do not know which ones to recommend as being most necessary.\n\nI note that extra transportation costs are given as a reason why the School should receive special consideration. The cost of shipping from Vancouver to Sechelt is as follows, the School being near the Union S.S.Co. dock at Sechelt:\n\n- Vegetables: 20\u00a2 per 100 lbs.\n- Groceries (crated): 20\u00a2\n- Meat, fresh: 60\u00a2\n- Feed: 17-1/2\u00a2\n- Hay: 22-1/2\u00a2\n\nFish are costing the School practically nothing, being caught near the School. A layman could run this School on the grant, and make a handsome profit.\n\nIf you could tell me what amount can be given this School for further repairs, renewals, etc., I could go over all the items with Father Maillard and decide where it could best be used. My personal opinion is that none is urgently necessary and whatever we do at the School, there will always be new requisitions so long as Father Maillard is Principal.\n\nThe enclosed copy of your letter to me was evidently intended for Father Grant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 387-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 4595 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. Mr. Perrier intends to discuss this whole question with the Very Rev. Father Byrne Grant at the first opportunity, and you will be advised concerning what improvements, if any, can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nP. J. C.

However, this is only offered as a suggestion and, if you have any special reasons for recommending some other breed, you should so state in your reply. In any event, you should give an estimate of the cost that would be incurred in purchasing two cows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n822 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, August 20th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nAbout the latter part of June, Mr. Agent Ball submitted to the Department a number of requests that you had made to himself and former Commissioner Ditchburn in connection with the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given by the Department to your requests and we have, also, had a personal interview with Very Reverend Byrne-Grant. Our funds this year are extremely limited and, under these circumstances, the Department cannot consider many of the requests that you have made. It has been decided, however, to give favourable consideration to the supplying of thirty (30) mattresses and two (2) cows. You will hear from Mr. Agent Ball in connection with these at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. Maillard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSechelt, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant and have just returned from Sechelt where the Reverend Principal showed me a machine which has been supplied him free for mixing a powdered milk called \"Trumilk\" so that it will not be necessary to purchase the cows for him. He states that this milk is very suitable and used in many institutions and will save the necessity of bringing in hay and feed and also roots for winter feed.\n\nFather Maillard has asked that some of the out-buildings be re-shingled and I have requested him to have the manual training teacher advise me of the number of shingles required. The boys will do the work under the supervision of the manual training teacher as part of their training.\n\nIn the laundry the dryer is badly warped and Father Maillard has written to the firm who supplied the original one asking for quotations on a new one.\n\nIn a previous requisition Father Maillard asked for new chicken houses to be built as the present ones are in a bad state, but now that he is not keeping cows he will use the barn for a chicken house so that this requisition is now cancelled.\n\nAs soon as possible I will send a requisition for authority to purchase sufficient shingles to re-roof the necessary buildings and would suggest that the money which would have been given to buy the cows be used for this purpose.\n\nI will also send you the measurements of the mattresses as soon as I hear from the Reverend Principal as he had not received your letter of the 20th, when I left there yesterday,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball).\nIndian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to refer further to your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding mattresses for the Sechelt Indian Residential School, also your authority to obtain estimate of the cost of two grade cows.\n\nThe mattresses required are:-\n\n1-1/2 doz. 72\" x 30\".\n1-1/2 \" 60\" x30\".\n\nI have already reported that the cows are not required.\n\nIf you will authorize the following roofing material, I will see that this work is done without charge for labour:-\n\n32 thousand shingles,\n2 sheets galv.iron 30\"x96\", 28 guage,\n1,200 feet 1x6 shiplap,\n100 lbs.galv.shingle nails 1-1/8\".\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. The cost of the above roofing material, plus freight, at today's prices, would be approximately $100.00.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, furnishing particulars as to the size of the mattresses required at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and also requesting that the roofing material as mentioned therein be supplied.\n\nWith reference to the mattresses, I have to say that you will be advised at a later date regarding the purchase.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of the following:\n\n- 32,000 shingles,\n- 2 sheets galv. iron, 30\"x96\", 25 gauge,\n- 1,200' 1x8 shiplap,\n- 100 lbs. galv. shingle nails, 1-1/8\".\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nIt is to be understood that the labour in connection with the roofing is to be performed by the school authorities without charge to this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

BUSKARD,\n\nThirty-six mattresses are required for the pupils' beds at the Sechelt Indian Residential School (British Columbia). The approximate cost will be about $150. Funds for the purpose can be provided from the Appropriation for Indian Education. I shall be pleased if you will direct as to the firms in Vancouver from whom the purchase should be made. The school is located in the federal district of Vancouver North.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 3, 1932.\n\nSCHOOLS BRANCH,\n\nMrs Sutherland,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of September 13th, quotations on the thirty-six mattresses required for the pupils' beds at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, B.C., may be asked from the following firms:\n\nRESTMORE MANUFACTURING CO.

It is noted that the cost will be approximately $85, including freight and duty.\n\nThe Department has expended a considerable amount for repairs and equipment at this school. Our funds are extremely limited and have been practically assigned. Therefore, it would be difficult to obtain the amount required to cover the cost of a stove. Could not the school authorities provide this equipment from their per capita allowance or other receipts? If not and if the supplying of a stove is urgent, you might again bring the matter to the attention of the Department, and, if possible, an effort will be made to obtain the funds necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As I have mentioned before, this school is a pattern for cleanliness from basement to roof and if the money is available, it will be well spent.

There was no sign of a leakage in the room above. It was, as far as I could discover, not a leakage from one of the pipes from a toilet or wash room. I would recommend that the Department have an engineer make an examination of the damage and its cause, in order that the necessary steps may be taken to rectify the cause.\n\nLaundry:\n\nAs mentioned last year, the heater for the laundry drier is urgently required. This matter can not be postponed any longer. The heater part of the present drier should certainly be replaced this Summer.\n\nElectric Light:\n\nA new set of batteries is VERY URGENTLY required. The present ones are now six years old. I understand that these batteries were tested by an expert this Spring and found to be in such a condition that they might become useless at any moment. This opinion cost the Principal the sum of $25.00 he states. The generator also needs to be repaired. It is short circuiting.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the application of the Reverend Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School for batteries for the lighting plant, Father Maillard has just called at the office and states that he considers this lighting system should be thoroughly inspected during the summer holidays. He considers this is part of the building and that with the reduced grant he claims that he can not finance the expense of either the inspection or the batteries.\n\nI beg to request advice as to what should be done under the circumstances.\n\nI believe there is some danger of short circuiting while the batteries are weak and consider it should be inspected by someone who understands the engine.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward a request from the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School for repairs to their Delco Lighting plant.\n\nReverend Father Maillard asks for 56 batteries 7x8-1/2\" x 10-1/2\", 23 plates to cell.\n\nThe dynamo needs overhauling to prevent frequent burning out of fuses.\n\nThe batteries were installed in 1927 being guaranteed for three years. The present cost in Vancouver would be practically $1,000.00.\n\nI do not know whether the Department considers this expense should be paid from the Grant and am therefore forwarding the request for your consideration.\n\nB/HM.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your two letters of the second instant, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, that a set of new batteries be supplied for the lighting plant and that the system be overhauled.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our Appropriation this year has been considerably reduced, and there are no funds available to provide the cost of supplying new batteries or of the overhauling and repairs required to the lighting system. The school authorities will have to pay the cost, from their per capita allowance or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nThere is a heavy deposit from 1 to 2 inches in each cell indicating that the plates are 75% worn out.\n\nBecause they will not hold their normal charge the generator must run practically continuously, greatly increasing the operating cost.\n\nWe believe that at least 50% of the cells (say 20) should be completely renewed and the remaining 26 cleaned out.\n\nWe will supply and install 30 new replacement cells and recondition the remaining 25, leaving all in good operating order for the sum of five hundred and thirty dollars less 15% less 10% ($530.00-15%-10%), nett $405.45.\n\nThe 30 new cells would be \"Coyle\" #L.P. 13 standard lighting batteries (160 ampere hour capacity), having \u00bc\" heavy duty plates, size 4\u00bd x 5-5/8 wood and rubber separators all in glass jars. All new cells equipped with straps, connectors and electrolyte.\n\nWe estimate that the 26 old cells would be good for one more year's service. They could then be replaced with Coyle type L.P. 13 cells making a complete standard battery good for several years use.\n\nSummary:\nGenerator repairs $75.00\nBattery repairs $405.45\nTotal $480.45\n\nAwaiting your instructions, we remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJARVIS ELECTRIC & REFRIGERATION CO.\n\nPer\n\n[Signature]\n\n[MEMBER ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRAGISTS INTERNATIONAL]\nJune 12/33.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Sechelt Indian School\nStorage Batteries & Generator.\n\nAt the request of Rev. Father Maillard, we have made\n2 trips to Sechelt to repair the electric lighting plant.\n\nWe find the plant in bad condition and respectfully tender\nthe following report.\n\nGenerator: (1)\nThe commutator on the generator is badly worn down causing\nsevere sparking and excessive wear on the brushes.\n\nThere are 2 remedies for this condition, namely to turn down\nand undercut the commutator or to install a new commutator.\nWe believe that turning the commutator down would be\nsatisfactory for several years more wear.\n\n(2). The generator bearings are well worn and should be renewed.\n\n(3). The brush holders should be repaired and new brushes supplied.\n\n(4). The coils should be thoroughly cleaned out and repainted\nwith insulating compound and baked.\n\nThis would necessitate shipping the machine in to our shop.\nThe work would require about 3 days time.\n\nThe total cost would be including freight to and from Vancouver\nseventy five dollars ($75.00).\n\nBatteries:\nThis set consists of 56 cells, 25 plate storage battery with\nthin type auto battery plates and not the proper type for\nlighting service.\n\nThey will not hold a full charge because the plates are\ncrumbling and in many cases buckled and insulators are cracked.\n\n[MEMBER ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICISTS INTERNATIONAL]\nSir:\n\nI have advised the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School of the contents of your letter of the 8th instant, and he says it is unfair to expect school repairs of this kind to be paid out of the grant. His plea is that everything for this school has to be bought, --milk, vegetables, meat, fuel, etc.,--whereas most other schools have a farm attached which materially reduces the cost of operating a school.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has now called in an expert from the Jarvis Electric Company of Vancouver and I attach his report which gives the cost in detail. It will be noted that he has reduced the number of cells required from the original idea of renewing all of them, making the total cost $480.45.\n\nThe Department is fully conversant with the Reverend Principal's contention that Sechelt School is so much more expensive to operate than other schools; I believe he took up this matter personally in Ottawa about two years ago.\n\nThe school is splendidly operated, the standard of cleanliness, efficiency and treatment of pupils being very high and I am forwarding this further report at the Reverend Principal's earnest request for assistance.\n\nThe engine which operates this plant also supplies current for the laundry, milk-mixer, etc., besides lighting. If the Department cannot see its way clear to pay the whole amount of $480.45, would it be possible to offer 50% of the.....\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nof the cost if the Reverend Principal will pay the balance? He has not suggested this in any way; it is entirely on my own responsibility that I mention it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Sechelt, B.C.\n\nOn July 11th, 1933, I made an inspection of the mechanical plant of this school, which consists of:\n\nTwo large sectional boilers\nOne vertical tubular boiler used for the laundry.\nOne Diesel Engine and storage battery.\n\nBOILER NO. 43561 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found it well kept. I then gave it a hydrostatic test of 25 lbs., and found everything perfectly tight. I adjusted the Safety Valves to blow off at 10 lb. pressure. They are working free. The fusible plug is to be renewed and the water glass and valves repacked. The steam gauge is 1 lb. light. Boiler was built in 1924.\n\nBOILER NO. 43560 B.C.\n\nOn the same day I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found it in good condition. I then gave it a hydrostatic test of 25 lbs., and found everything quite tight except the glands of the water gauge and test cocks. These must be repacked. The steam gauge quadrant appears to be broken and a new steam gauge must be installed. The fusible plug must also be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate for both the above boilers, allowing a steam pressure of 10 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBOILER NO. 6504 B.C.\n\nThis is a vertical tubular and is used to supply steam to the laundry. I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found it in good condition.\n\nThe construction of this boiler is not good and none are now made; the long joint is single riveted lap. The present construction is either single or double butt joint. The fusible plug is inserted in the tubes instead of the plate.\n\nThe tubes are getting quite thin in the top head and will need\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nrenewing in the near future. When that is required, I would recommend for the reasons stated that a new boiler be installed.\n\nI gave this boiler a hydrostatic test of 55 lbs., and found just a slight moisture showing around the tubes. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a pressure of 25 lbs., and condition fair.\n\nI would like to point out that the blowdown pipes are connected together without intervening check valves. This method has proven very dangerous, as if one of the boilers was empty and being cleaned and the blowdown cock of the other boiler was opened, the hot water and steam would come back to the empty boiler and burn the attendant. However, as the pipes will need renewing soon, separate blowdown pipes can be installed at that time.\n\nThis plant as a whole is fairly well kept and with slight expense each year can be brought up to first class condition.\n\nI then inspected the Diesel Engine and batteries. These are just about done. The engine appears to be in fairly good shape, but I did not have the pistons drawn. On my next inspection they will be drawn by the time I get there.\n\nBefore the new batteries are ordered I would suggest that prices be obtained for a batteryless unit as there are several now in operation and they give very good satisfaction and are much cheaper in operating than a battery set.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J.

He reported as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 43560. This boiler is in good condition, except the glands of the water gauge and test cocks. These must be repacked. The steam gauge quadrant appears to be broken and a new steam gauge must be installed. The fusible plug should also be renewed.\n\nBoiler No. 43561. The fusible plug is to be renewed and the water glass and valves repacked.\n\nThe Inspector states that the plant as a whole is fairly well kept and, with slight expense each year, it can be brought up to first class condition. Please draw to the attention of the principal of the school the Inspector's recommendations as to the repairs required at the present time. The school authorities should arrange to have the work carried out - the cost to be paid from per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th October last regarding repairs to boilers and machinery at the Sechelt Indian Residential School as recommended by the Boiler Inspector in July last. All these repairs have been completed and the boilers are now in excellent condition.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe manual training class is quite capable of carrying out the lining of the upper part of the walls of the boys' basement, which I recommended in my last report. Nothing has been done yet; the walls are still in a terrible state as far as the upper parts are concerned. Some form of Lamatco or Beaverboard, or Three-ply wood should be used. The material might well be supplied by the Department. Reference is requested to my last report on manual training at this school. I am not repeating the information given in that report.\n\nIn the Sisters' dining room the leakage in the wall reported previously became much worse through the bursting of a steam pipe. The plaster of the end wall of this dining room is down. The lath work is breaking away. The lath work needs to be replaced over a section of perhaps 100 square feet and the wall requires to be replastered. The same type of work requires to be done on the other side of this interior wall, in the primary classroom. There is a large opening now between the Sisters' dining room and the primary classroom. I do not understand why such a condition is allowed to exist, regardless of who is responsible for the payment for repairs. There is some doubt in my mind that the Department should be called on to pay for this repair. I do not know of course if the Indian Agent reported this to the Department. I have the honour to request that this wall be repaired as soon as possible.\n\nThere are only two toilet bowls on the boys' side in the basement. These are of course more used than the upstairs toilets. There are about 30 boys. It will be easily seen that the toilet accommodation is not sufficient. When I have to report that one of these toilet bowls is quite out of commission through a completely blocked pipe, it will be apparent that a very serious state of things exists. The Principal informs me that everything has been done to clear the drain pipe, which runs under the basement floor. They have used hose pipes to supply water under pressure. This is, of course, about the worst thing they could have done. It is evident to me that there is a block of paper or some cloth in the drain pipe which should be removed with a wire or draining cleaning apparatus. I would ask the Department to issue instructions for the immediate cleaning out of this toilet and drain, the matter being more or less urgent. I certainly consider that when drains are blocked like this, through what will probably prove to be carelessness and poor supervision, the entire cost of repair or cleaning should be borne by the school authorities, and not paid by the Department.\n\nI also reported a year ago that a new set of batteries was very urgently required. I am sorry to have to report now that my advice was not taken, and only 30 out of 56 cells were renewed. There are still 26 cells to be replaced. By now some damage at least will have been caused to the new cells by working them with old cells. The Principal states that the old cells on March 1st will have been seven years in use. Why a complete set of battery cells was not provided at the same time, I fail to understand. The old cells are preventing the electric light plant working in a satisfactory manner, and if kept in this battery will ruin the new cells in a short time. I have therefore to request that 26 new battery cells of the suitable type be placed here to take the place of those cells now worn out.\nOttawa, April 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, on the 22nd and 23rd ultimo.\n\nInspector Barry states that the manual training class is quite capable of carrying out the lining of the upper part of the walls in the boys' basement. This is stated to be in terrible shape, as far as the upper parts are concerned. Please advise the Department what it would cost to supply the necessary material.\n\nThe Inspector states, also, that the lath work in the Sisters' dining room needs to be replaced. You might let me know the cost of repairing this.\n\nMr. Barry also reports that the drain pipe under the basement floor is blocked. It is considered that the school management should have this cleaned out.\n\nThe Inspector considers that 26 new battery cells should be supplied. You will remember that we supplied only 30 last year. Please let me know the condition of all the battery cells at the present time. You should keep in mind that our funds are limited and we are not prepared to consider supplying more cells if the ones at present in use will serve the purpose for at least another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding Inspector Barry's report on his inspection of Sechelt Residential School.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I visited the School and regarding paragraph two of your letter in which Mr. Barry states that the \"boys' basement is in terrible shape as far as the upper parts are concerned\" I beg to advise that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The lower five feet were finished with lumber supplied last year, the portion of the walls above the lumber is solid cement and boards do not belong to it. There is a small area near the door covering part of the heating apparatus which is not cement and owing to a leak of steam in the apparatus, this plaster was destroyed. The same thing applies to the lath work in the sisters' dining room as mentioned in the third paragraph of your letter.\n\nHad Mr. Barry mentioned these matters to the Reverend Principal or myself he would have found out that the damage was recent and arrangements had been made for its repair which has been done. They were both very minor repair jobs.\n\nRegarding the drain pipe, this of course was attended to by the School.\n\nWith reference to the twenty-six new battery cells, the Reverend Principal and I have had this under consideration for some time. As stated in your letter, thirty new cells were supplied last year and it was hoped that this would carry over for two or three years longer, but there is danger of damaging the new cells by overcharging when bringing the old ones up to the strength of the new ones. It throws too big a load on the new cells, and it would probably be economy to replace the twenty-six old cells now rather than risk possible damage to them. I will report under separate cover regarding the cost of replacing the cells.\n\nThis School is kept in splendid condition at all times, absolutely clean and sanitary and the Department is often complimented by the public regarding it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 20th ultimo, paragraph 5, regarding 26 battery cells needed at the Sechelt Residential School lighting plant.\n\nI have had this examined and the electrician reports that they are damaging the 30 new cells by overcharging and that the 26 old ones should be replaced as soon as possible as five or six of the new ones show undue flaking which will become worse as the old cells weaken.\n\nThe Jarvis Electric Co. put in the 30 cells last year and today, on calling for an estimate for 26 cells gave the figure as $488.69. I pointed out that this was higher than their charge for 30 cells last year and they then reduced it to $429.68. I was not satisfied even with this reduction and asked the other electrical company handling these batteries, the Brettell Distributing Co., to look the plant over and give a report. They will install 26 batteries, check over the plant, pay freight and cartage and all other expenses for $292.00 plus sales tax $14.60 or $306.60 in all, which is $122.79 lower than the Jarvis Electric Co. and I respectfully recommend that the 26 cells be replaced at that figure.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJawis Etc.\n\n1933 - 30 cells \u2014 405 45\n\n1934 - 26 cells \u2014 429 68\n\nButtell Distributing Co.\n\n26 cells \u2014 306 84\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nThe batteries for the lighting plant, Sechelt Indian Residential School, required renewal last year and thirty new cells were purchased and installed. The battery is a fifty-six cell outfit and the twenty-six old cells are now in such poor condition that they are damaging the new ones installed last fall.\n\nOur local Indian Agent, Mr. F.J.C. Ball, obtained prices from the Jarvis Electric Company, of Vancouver, for the installation of the twenty-six cells now required. They gave a figure of $486.59. Mr. Ball reports that he pointed out to them that this was more than what they charged last year for thirty cells, that is $480.45. The Jarvis Electric Company in view of this reduced their quotation to $429.66. Mr. Ball not being satisfied with this price made inquiries from the Bretell Distributing Company, the only other electrical company handling the type of battery required. They have offered to install the twenty-six batteries, check over the plant, pay freight and cartage and all other expenses for $306.59, sales tax included. This would indicate a difference of $132.79 in the price quoted by the Jarvis Electric Company, which is a considerable amount and cannot very well be overlooked.\n\nI would be pleased to have your direction as to whether this order may be placed with the Bretell Distributing Company.\n\nOttawa, May 19th., 1934.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nI beg to refer to our memorandum of the 19th instant, in reference to the purchase of batteries for the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nAs it is important that these replacements be made immediately, I will be glad to have your instructions as to what firm should receive the order.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nOttawa, May 30th, 1934.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding School Inspector Barry's report on Sechelt Residential School.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has handed me the enclosed account for repairing the walls damaged by leaks in the heating system as mentioned in Mr. Barry's report and asks that this be refunded to him as it covers repairs to the building for which he does not feel responsible.\n\nThe account is quite reasonable and I respectfully request instructions as to whether this can be vouchered for.

Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Inspection of Boilers & Machinery,\nIndian Residential School,\nSechelt, B.C.\n\nBoiler No. 43507 B.C.\n\nOn June 15th, 1934, I gave this boiler a careful\ninspection and found it in a good condition. I then gave\nit a hydrostatic test of 25 lbs. and found it perfectly\ntight.\n\nThe steam gauge expansion tube was split but there was\na spare gauge there which I recalibrated and installed.\nIt is now correct.\n\nThe fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of\n5 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 43506 B.C.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a similar inspection\nand found it in first class condition.\n\nThe steam gauge is correct. A new water gauge glass is\nrequired and a new fusible plug. The blowdown pipe is\nin a fair condition.\n\nI set the safety valves of both boilers to blow off at\n5 lbs. water pressure.\n\nThe repairs pointed out in my last report have been\nattended to.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure\nof 5 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 6504.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful internal\nand external inspection and found that many of the tubes\nwere quite badly pitted, also there was some on the\ncombustion chamber head and plates, but I do not anticipate\nany trouble this year.\nBoiler No. 6504 (Cont'd).\n\nI then gave it a hydrostatic test of 50 lbs., and found one tube leaking on the top tube sheet. This must be rerolled.\n\nThe steam gauge is 2 lbs. light. The water gauge requires a new glass and packing. I set the safety valve to blow off at 25 lbs. water pressure.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 25 lbs. and condition good.\n\nI would recommend that this boiler be allowed to last as long as it will without extensive repairs and when it requires retubing, which will be within two years, that a new boiler be procured as this boiler is much too small for the work required of it. These vertical boilers, in nearly all cases, are much too small and are not suitable for the work required of them and when replaced one of a submerged tube type should be installed.\n\nwhilst I was there the Principal of the school called my attention to the primitive method of drying the clothes, but under the present type of plant the only method which I could see to improve it would be to partition off a portion of the Chapel, which is above the boilerroom and cut two openings in the Boilerroom ceiling and enclose two ventilators which must have adjustable shutters so that when clothes are to be dried, they can be opened and the heat of the boiler-room allowed to go through into the new drying room, or install a new high pressure boiler and a new rotary drying machine in the laundry which is the better method, but more expensive.\n\nI would also recommend that the following solution be used in all the boilers:\n\nMix 2 lbs. of Sal Soda with 4 gals. clear lime water.\n\nUse about 1/2 pint of mixture to each boiler per week.\n\nIf a lime deposit appears on the fittings, reduce the amount of lime.\n\nBlow down about 1/2\" of water each day and keep vertical boiler dry when not in use. A new 1/2\" injector should be installed on the vertical boiler.\nAuxiliary Machinery.\n\nThe auxiliary machinery is generally in a fairly good condition and is well kept.\n\nWhilst I was there some new batteries were being installed in the set. Some were installed last year and have been doing double duty. This is not good practice. When this set is done, I would recommend that consideration be given to a Batteryless set of Diesel Engines, similar to the set installed at Lejac School, which are both efficient and very economical.\n\nThe Cold Storage plant is in a fair condition, but will soon need a good overhaul. Unfortunately, the Agent who supplied the Compressor, I have been informed, is out of business and as there is no name plate the spare parts are hard to procure and perhaps a new Compressor may be required; but by the present appearances no repairs will be required this season.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J.

He reports regarding the boilers at this school as follows:-\n\nBoiler No. 43507 B. C. - found in good condition. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nBoiler No. 43506 B. C. - This boiler found in first-class condition. A new water gauge glass is required and a new fusible plug.\n\nBoiler No. 6504 - It was found that many of the tubes were badly pitted, also that there was some on the combustion chamber head and plates but that no trouble is anticipated this year. After giving the boiler a hydrostatic test, one tube was found leaking on the top tube sheet. This must be re-rolled. The steam gauge is 2 lbs. light. The water gauge requires a new glass and packing.\n\nThe Engineer recommends that the following solution be used in all the boilers:- Mix 2 lbs. Sal Soda with 4 gals. clear lime water. Use about 1/2 pint of mixture to each boiler per week. If a lime deposit appears on the fittings, reduce the amount of lime. Blow down about 1/2\" of water each day and keep vertical boiler dry when not in use. A new 1/2\" injector should be installed on the vertical boiler.\n\nPlease draw to the attention of the Principal of the\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.

This boiler needs replacing, as the School cannot maintain steam in it.\n\nA new one would cost $455.00 less whatever allowance we could get on the old one, but the Vancouver Iron Works, Ltd., of 1155 West 6th St., Vancouver, have one which could be purchased for $225.00 (less allowance for old one). It has been slightly used but certified for pressure up to 150 lbs., whereas the highest pressure used at the school now is about 35 lbs.\n\nThe Rev. Father Fahlman called yesterday in the matter and would like to have early action as he is being replaced as Principal, and wants to leave the school in proper condition.\n\nThe boiler inspector has inspected the plant and the remainder of the machinery is in good shape.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nB/DH.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.O.Ball)\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 827-5, part 6)\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 12, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the tubular boiler of the laundry of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, you may arrange for the purchase of a boiler from the Vancouver Iron Works Limited.

All defects must be remedied and report sent to the Chief Inspector, together with engineers' names and class of certificates, if not filled in on report. Certificate for this boiler cannot be issued until all requirements on this report have been complied with and annual fees paid to date.\n\nPlease attend to this immediately as it is ILLEGAL TO OPERATE BOILER WITHOUT CERTIFICATE.\n\nSIR,\u2014I have this day inspected your boiler, No. 06504 B.C., located at V.M.D., and found condition of same as follows:\n\n| Size of boiler | Test-cocks | No. of boilers in plant |\n|----------------|------------|------------------------|\n| Type of boiler | Blow-off cock | No. of engineers required |\n| Horse-power    | Blow-off pipe | Class of engineers required |\n| Age            | Safety-valves | Name of 1st engineer |\n| Type of long. joint | Main stop-valve | Grade and number |\n| Hydrostatic test | Steam-gauge | Name of 2nd engineer |\n| State of boiler under test | Water-gauge | Grade and number |\n| Working-pressure | Fusible plug | Name of 3rd engineer |\n| W.P. on engines, pipes, and valves | Is boiler in service? | Grade and number |\n\nREMARKS:\n\nThe plate of which this boiler is made is too thin (5/32\").\n\nDo not put it into use.\n\nInspector of Boilers.\n\nFees received\n\nRepairs completed\n\nCertificate issued\n\nReceipt No.\n\nEngineers' names received\n\nCertificate No.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Department,\nDominion of Canada,\n416, Federal Building,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWith reference to the small upright boiler received from the Indian School at Sechelt, we regret to say the Inspector will not allow it to be used as he considers the shell too thin and dangerous.\n\nWe enclose herewith report of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nVANCOUVER IRON WORKS LTD.\n\n(SGD.) W.T. Fraser\n\nWTF/EB\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a voucher for $233.15 for a boiler installed at Sechelt Residential School on your authority. It was expected that we should receive $75.00 for the old boiler, but the enclosed certificate prevents its use for any purpose, as the plate is too thin. If it can be disposed of as scrap iron, it would bring about $5.00 or $10.00. If the Department will authorise this, I will make enquiries and see whether the freight exceeds the amount we should be offered for it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that the Sechelt Residential School has applied for a new range. In the School Inspector's report he recommends this, as the Reverend Principal is desirous of giving the pupils a more varied diet than is now possible.\n\nThe range in use is a three-oven \"Canadian Lang\" in fair condition, but this type of range is not suitable for burning wood, as the two outer ovens do not heat; it requires fuel burnt under pressure, either coal or oil, to give proper heat to all three ovens.\n\nThe one desired by the School is called the Malahat Albion heavy-duty with two ovens. The total cost of this range with warming closet and freight to Sechelt would be $250.00 approximately.\n\nThere has been much criticism of this school under the former Principal because of the diet of the pupils, and the present Principal is anxious to avoid such criticism in future. The School Inspector states that beans and similar foods are given too often, and the Principal would give more roast meat if he had a range to cook it. If this range is supplied, we could probably sell the present one to a logging camp where they are generally used. The hardware company occasionally has calls for them, so could sell ours possibly for $100.00 to $125.00, as they do not stock the three-oven range now.\n\nI respectfully recommend the School's request for your favourable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Fred Ball]\n\n(F.J.G. Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo I regret that our funds for the current fiscal year have been completely assigned. Under these circumstances it is not possible to purchase the new range requested by the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. If you make another application for this range about April 1 it is likely that the Department will be able to authorize it at that time. When writing you should state the name of the firm from whom the Malahat Albion range can be purchased.\n\nBefore selling the range at present in the school it will be necessary for us to secure the permission of the Salvage Officer. This will be obtained when you apply again for authority to purchase a new range.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to apply for some kalsomine to the value of approximately $6.00, for the purpose of kalsomining a building at Sechelt Indian Residential School which has been remodelled into a sports room, badly needed at the School. This room is the upper portion of a barn 54 x 30, and will be used for basket-ball, badminton, etc.\n\nThe School has done the work and supplied the lumber for remodelling from other old buildings, and the room should be kalsomined.\n\nIf you will kindly authorize this, the School will do the labour.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant you may purchase the kalsomine requested by the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School. It is noted that the cost will not exceed $6.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. M. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.

All the other buildings, including the school, have been painted in the past year or two, and the staff house, which stands in a central position has not been painted. The building is 27 x 33 x 30 and will need at least two coats, or 20 gallons, including eaves and porch. The roof, which is four sided will need 8 gallons of shingoleen, as there are approximately 1200 square feet of roofing.\n\nI respectfully recommend that this work be done to protect the building, as there is practically no paint remaining on it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant please let me know the colour of the paint that you recommend be supplied for painting the staff house at the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nWill the labour be done by the school staff without cost to the Department?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

C.\nSECHELT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSECHELT B.C.\n\nApril 26th 1938.\n\nF.J.C.Ball Esq.\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry as to the colour of paint required for the painting of the staff-house here, I should like to inform you that the colour we have decided on for the walls of the building is \"flesh tint\", for the trimmings, I think a straight white would match well. For the roof we have selected the special green. As for the quantity required, as I mentioned before, I think we will need about twenty gallons for the walls but as some of this will be needed for the trimmings, I think the proper proportion would be - 15 gallons of flesh tint and five gallons of plain white. As for the roof, I have not been able to find out the necessary quantity, but as I have forwarded the dimensions to you, I hope it will not put you to too much trouble to enquire into that.\n\nThanking you in advance for your trouble in procuring the paint for us, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"E.J.Cornell\". O.M.I.\nSir:\n\nre: File No. 167-18-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and to enclose herewith copy of the Reverend Principal's letter regarding paint for the staff building. The cost wholesale would be approximately $3.55 per gallon delivered at Sechelt, and we should need about 10 gallons of shingoleen for the roof, as well.\n\nThe School will do the painting themselves, so there will be no charge for labour.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 6)\n**MARSHALL-WELLS B.C.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that the batteries of Sechelt Indian Residential School lighting plant need renewing within the next few weeks, as it is necessary to run the engine continuously at present. Some repair work and overhauling on the engine will also be necessary. These batteries cost approximately $600, and are good for about four years.\n\nIn the past year, the Columbia Power Company has installed a lighting plant for Sechelt district covering about thirty miles surrounding that town and they offer us full service for $35 per month. This will include lighting at the school, barn, priests residence and staff house, and power for two motors in the refrigerator and laundry.\n\nThe boiler inspector reports as follows:\n\n\"The batteries are in a very bad condition and will need renewing before winter. I would suggest that consideration be given to purchasing power. If done, a small motor would operate refrigerator and also one for the laundry. Then the fire hazard of gasoline engines would be removed.\"\n\nThe present plant is 1-8 Horsepower Diesel Petter engines, with 66 batteries and a 3 Horsepower gasoline engine for the refrigerator, and another \u00bd Horsepower gasoline engine.\n\nThe running costs are approximately $120.00 per annum for fuel oil, $15.00 for lubricating oil and $100.00 for gasoline, so that the annual cost is $235.00 for fuel and approximately $150.00 for batteries or $385.00 against $420.00 for service from the power company. This does not include depreciation or repairs to engine, or the labour cost of engineer.\n\nI consider it would be advantageous to purchase power both from the financial standpoint and also as the boiler inspector points out, the fire hazard.\n\nWe should require two small motors costing approximately $150.00 for the two.\n\nWith regard to the present engine, it would be quite suitable for Homalco Reserve where the Band is considering purchase of an engine for the village, they are already wired for it as they had a Pelton wheel which broke down many years ago. No batteries would be required there.\nUnder all the circumstances I respectfully recommend that the change be made.\n\nIf this is done, will you please advise me whether the school would pay for the light from their grant or will it be paid by the Department in addition to the grant.\n\nYour instructions are respectfully requested.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F. J. C. Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, regarding allowance on an old boiler at Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen the laundry boiler was replaced, the Vancouver Iron Works offer of $225.00, less allowance for old boiler, was accepted. No valuation could be set on the old boiler until it was brought to Vancouver and tested and when this was done, it was condemned by the boiler inspector as worthless, and the Vancouver Iron Works allowed us $10. as scrap iron.\n\nAccording to the agreement with the Vancouver Iron Works of \"$225.00 less allowance for old boiler\" I considered it to be one transaction. The $10. allowance should have been deducted from the account, but they had not had time for the old boiler to be examined when they sent their account in for payment.\n\nThe above offer of $225.00 less the old boiler was authorized by your letter of October 13th, 1937, and considered to be the complete transaction, otherwise we should have advised the Vancouver Iron Works not to take the old boiler, but to leave it at Sechelt for instructions of the salvage officer.\n\nI regret if there was anything in the above transaction which was contrary to regulations. I telephoned the Vancouver Iron Works this morning and they advise me their records show that the old boiler was sold to the Schwartz Junk Dealers for $8.00, at a total loss of $13.35 as they paid the freight from Sechelt to Vancouver.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.

There was a hitch in the arrangements mentioned in my report of the 9th ultimo as the School, after re-considering the matter, refused to pay $35.00 per month for service. It was necessary to hold further meetings with the local authorities and the Power Company, eventually, by further examination of requirements and stressing the fact that little service is required for two months of the year, a reduction to $27.00 per month was obtained, and the School is pleased with this rate.\n\nThe following motors are necessary if the present refrigeration system is to be continued. This is an old ammonia refrigerator requiring a 3 H.P. motor, but it should be replaced with a more modern one which could be operated on a 1/3 H.P. motor, making considerable difference in consumption. This would cost about $300.00 to $350.00, although these figures are not guaranteed, and I do not know what would be allowed for the present refrigerator and engine. If it is not replaced, the ammonia in it should be renewed, as the refrigerator has leaked and has not been serviced for seven or eight years, whereas it should be serviced annually, or at least, bi-annually.\n\nThe motors required are, for the laundry, one 3 H.P. 220 volt 3 phase 60 cycle 1200 R.P.M. squirrel cage induction with sliding base and 5\" diameter x 5\" face pulley. For the refrigerator, one 2 H.P. 220 volt 3 phase 60 cycle 1200 R.P.M. squirrel cage induction motor sliding base 4\" diameter x 4\" face pulley.\n\nI have not given particulars of the 1/3 H.P. motor required for a new refrigerator until you advise me whether it can be supplied. There may be an expense of bringing the lines to the school building - 2 poles will be necessary and possibly one or two other small items, but the Power Company states this will be quite a small account.\n\nUpon receipt of the motors, or instructions to purchase them locally, whichever is decided upon, the work can be taken in hand.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the new arrangements that have been made regarding electric light and power for the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nWhy do you consider it necessary to purchase new motors? Would it not be possible to operate the machinery mentioned in your letter by electric power? Please let me have a complete report in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

C.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-5.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th ultimo re motors for Sechelt Indian Residential School, I explained that the present system is one Diesel engine and one gas engine, with a belt from the Diesel to run the refrigerator, the gas engine being used for the laundry.\n\nThe motors described in my letter of the 6th ultimo are electric motors, not engines, and, of course, the power will not operate a gas engine. There will be one gas engine for disposal by the salvage officer, which I omitted to mention before, but I do not think there is anything further to add to my letter of the 6th ultimo. I hope this matter will not be unduly delayed, but if there is any further information required, please advise me.\n\nWith regard to the Diesel engine to be transferred to Homalco Reserve, there will be some expense in connecting and wiring, and also for a shed to house it. The Homalco Indians are pressing for light to be installed before winter and are willing to pay all such expenses from their Band Funds and if this matter can be expedited, it will be much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.G.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nNovember 14, 1936\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 09-822\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

I have again reviewed your letter of the 6th instant but I am not certain what you consider is the best course to take regarding the refrigerator. In the second paragraph of your letter you state that the more modern refrigeration system could be operated on a 1/3 H.P. motor and in the third paragraph of your letter you request us to order a 2 H.P. motor for the refrigerator.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of a new refrigerator and at the same time you should let me know what you consider might be allowed for the present refrigerator and engine. I am not certain that our funds will permit the purchase of this equipment this year but before deciding to purchase a new 2 H.P. motor I consider it would be advisable to give some consideration to what it would cost to operate a more modern refrigeration system.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant regarding the refrigerator at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe reason I did not ask for the 1/3 H.P. motor and new refrigerator was that I felt the high cost would be prohibitive at the present time, and that the School could get along very well for a few years with the old refrigerator.\n\nThe price would be over $400.00 for a refrigerator of the required size. The present refrigerator would not sell for $50.00 as these old ammonia affairs are obsolete, and difficult to dispose of. The 2 H.P. engine would possibly bring $75.00 to $100.00 in its present condition if anyone needed an engine of this type, so the decision is between an approximate expenditure as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| New Refrigerator, approx.     | $400.00|\n| Plus 1/3 H.P.Motor, \"         | $60.00 |\n| Less salvage on old refrig., approx. | $50.00 |\n| 3H.P.Motor                    | $100.00|\n| Amount required, approx.      | $310.00|\n\ncompared with a cost of 2 H.P.Motor, approx. $120.00\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Less salvage on 3 H.P. motor   | $100.00|\n| Amount required, approx.       | $20.00 |\n\nWhile these figures are only approximate, as I do not know at what cost the Purchasing Department can obtain motors, I believe it would cost about $300.00 to instal new refrigeration. If the Department wishes to do this at present, of course, the 1/3 H.P. motor instead of the 2 H.P. is all we need for a modern refrigerator.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(P.J.G.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES 167-18-5\n\nDecember 3 1938\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Sechelt Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 75 Allotment 09-523\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Ball,\nVancouver,\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nIn one of our previous conversations you mentioned that you might be able to get us two outdoor drinking fountains like you provided at the North Vancouver School. If you can still get these for us, we would find them very useful.\n\nWishing you the best of health and hoping to see you soon, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.J. Cornell, O.M.I.\nVancouver, B.C., June 21st, 1939\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received this morning from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential school.\n\nWith regard to the drinking fountains, these are a health measure. The two I recommended and placed in Squamish Residential school last year have been worth a great deal to them, and the Reverend Principal there is most grateful for them. The cost was $51.96 for the material, and the school supplied the labour. There would be a slight extra cost for freight and packing if they are supplied to Sechelt School, and if funds are available, I would recommend it as a health measure.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nF.J.C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed accounts are forwarded to you under the following circumstances. Authority was received last year for connecting the Sechelt Residential School with the Columbia Power Company's light and power system, in place of the plant then in operation, and in need of batteries. The engine was later sent to Churchhouse for use by the Homalco Indians, as per your authority, and will be utilised there as soon as the expense of installing it has been approved, chargeable to Homalco Band Funds.\n\nWhen authority was received from the Department to connect with the Columbia Power Company, I asked them for an estimate of cost, and was advised that it would be only a small amount, but they could not say exactly what work would be required until they reached the old plant which I authorised them to do. From that point, and without advising me, they took their instructions from the Reverend Principal who acted in good faith, of course, and thought the Company was authorised to do whatever he required. The gymnasium is in a separate building, and I did not know that it was being wired until after the job was completed. The Reverend Principal repaired and lined and re-floored the upper part of a big barn for a gymnasium, which is in continual use for basketball, roller-skating, etc., sports previously unknown at Sechelt School, and which have proved a great asset. The Reverend Principal did not know that he should have obtained authority for this work, and instructed the Power Company to do it.\n\nThe wiring in the school and staff houses was not up to standard for the Company's system, and much of it had to be re-wired to pass inspection. The Company claims that nothing was done unless it was absolutely necessary to pass inspection and that the labour of their own workmen, and the material is at cost price, plus 10%. They have itemized their account, and although it is higher than expected, I consider they have done the job as economically as possible, and the wiring, in the school buildings especially, is now safe. The Company states that they found open fuses which might have proved a fire hazard, and this has all been replaced by conduits. I have been over the whole job, item by item, and everything charged has been installed as stated. The account is now forwarded for your approval; it has been delayed since last year for various reasons, and the Company is now asking for an early settlement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 827-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 8th ultimo, in connection with the cost of wiring the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen the question of securing electrical power from the Columbia Power Company was first brought to our attention in your letter of September 9, 1938, no mention was made of any expenditure that would be necessary for re-wiring the building. No provision for this expenditure was made in our current year's appropriation, and it is quite evident from your letter of the 8th ultimo that the Principal proceeded with the work without obtaining any specific authority.\n\nAs you have been informed in other communications, the present set-up of our appropriation does not permit expenditures for which provision has not been specifically made. Under these circumstances, I regret that the Department is unable to consider payment of the enclosed voucher for $495.88.\n\nAs you are aware, there is no longer any deduction from the per capita allowance to residential schools, and in addition the 5% deducted from the March quarter grant is being refunded when paying the June quarter per capita allowance. This provision will assist the school management in paying the enclosed account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. J. C.

Ball Esq;\n416 Federal Bldg;\nVancouver B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball;\n\nSome time ago we discussed the question of some repair work which had to be done at the school here and you instructed us forward you the details of the work and an estimate on the cost. We have picked out the items which are of most importance and are forwarding them to you.\n\nThe first item is the repair of the furnaces in the school building. The grates in both furnaces are burnt out but the Boiler Inspector, Mr. Arnold advised us that it was not necessary to renew the grates. He said that if the floor and sides of the fire box were lined with fire brick it would give us just as good if not better results. I called in a brick layer from Robert's Creek and his estimate for labor and material for one furnace (which is all we need at present) would be $33.00.\n\nI asked Mr. Morley for an estimate on the carpentry work to be done and it amounts to $80.00 for labor and I am forwarding the list of materials he would require.\nI am sending along Mr. French's estimate on the painting work to be done.\n\nThere are a few other repairs to be made but we will be able to do some of them ourselves and the rest are not urgent. At present our workman is removing the moss from the roof of the school building and although it is quite heavy, it does not seem to have done any material damage to the shingles. The roof will not need painting for another year or two.\n\nHoping that you will be able to have this work done during the holidays, and that the details supplied are sufficient, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 6)\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a request for repairs to Sechelt Residential School.\n\nI have not investigated the estimates for carpentry, etc., as presumably funds are not available.\n\nMr. Morley is the manual training instructor at the School and has made up the list of material and labour, but I will go into the matter in detail and report upon it if and when the work can be done. It is not an emergency.\n\nWill you kindly return the enclosed papers?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.

The cost was quite a bit more than expected owing to extra work on the school.\n\nOttawa has not yet paid for the work and Mr. Ball advises that they have taken the position that there is no appropriation for this work and that they are therefore unable to pay the bill.\n\nWe were not looking to make any particular profit on this work so long as our costs were covered and you will note that the invoices cover merely the actual cost of materials and labour plus 10% on our overhead of doing business.

However, the cost of the service would have to be paid by the school management from their funds.\n\nWe would be prepared to supply the two small motors which you state would be required and the cost of which you estimate at approximately $150.00. Please let me have full details in order that the Purchasing Agent may be directed to secure them.\n\nI note your suggestion that the Diesel engine at present in the school be transferred to the Homalco Reserve. You will be written to under separate cover regarding this suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that the batteries of Sechelt Indian Residential School lighting plant need renewing within the next few weeks, as it is necessary to run the engine continuously at present. Some repair work and overhauling on the engine will also be necessary. These batteries cost approximately $600 and are good for about four years.\n\nIn the past year, the Columbia Power Company has installed a lighting plant for Sechelt district covering about thirty miles surrounding that town, and they offer us full service for $35 per month. This will include lighting at the school, barn, priest's residence and staff house, and power for two motors in the refrigerator and laundry.\n\nThe boiler inspector reports as follows:\n\n\"The batteries are in a very bad condition and will need renewing before winter. I would suggest that consideration be given to purchasing power. If done, a small motor would operate refrigerator and also one for the laundry. Then the fire hazard of gasoline engines would be removed.\"\n\nThe present plant is 1-8 Horsepower Diesel Petter engine, with 56 batteries and a 3 Horsepower gasoline engine for the refrigerator, and another \u00bd Horsepower gasoline engine.\n\nThe running costs are approximately $120.00 per annum for fuel oil, $15.00 for lubricating oil and $100.00 for gasoline, so that the annual cost is $235.00 for fuel and approximately $150.00 for batteries or $385.00 against $420.00 for service from the power company. This does not include depreciation or repairs to engine, or the labour cost of engineer.\n\nI consider it would be advantageous to purchase power, both from the financial standpoint and also as the boiler inspector points out, the fire hazard.\n\nWe should require two small motors costing approximately $150.00 for the two.\n\nWith regard to the present engine, it would be quite suitable for Holman Reserve where the Band is considering purchase of an engine for the village, they are already wired for it as they had a Pelton wheel which broke down many years ago. No batteries would be required there.\nUnder all the circumstances I respectfully recommend that the change be made.\n\nIf this is done, will you please advise me whether the school would pay for the light from their grant or will it be paid by the Department in addition to the grant.\n\nYour instructions are respectfully requested.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Subsequently it was decided that only one motor was necessary and this was purchased on December 2, 1938, (see purchase order No. 6827).\n\nNo further communication regarding expenditure in connection with the installation of the power from the Columbia Power Company was received by the Department until Mr. Ball's letter of June 8 reached us. You will note that in that letter Mr. Ball intimated that the Reverend Principal of the Sechelt school authorized the expenditure without referring the matter to him.\nIn the letter of October 18, 1939, which the Columbia Power Company addressed to Mr. Bruce Boyd it is stated that -- \"Mr. Ball gave instructions to our superintendent at that time to proceed with such work as might be necessary for making the change over\". You will note that this information is considerably different from that contained in Mr. Ball's letter of June 8. If Mr. Ball gave such instructions to the Columbia Power Company he had no authority to do so as you will see from the copies of the letters which we addressed to him in connection with this matter.\n\nUnder the circumstances I consider that copies of all the correspondence should be forwarded to Indian Commissioner Mackay with a view to having him investigate the matter fully and advise whether or not he considers payment should be made by the Department. We are writing to Major Mackay today and in the attached letter Mr. Boyd is being so advised.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copies of the following letters:\n\n1. Letter from Indian Agent Ball dated September 9, 1938\n2. Official reply of September 22, 1938\n3. Copy of Indian Agent Ball's letter of June 8, 1939\n4. Copy of our reply dated July 8, 1939\n5. Copy of letter addressed to Mr. Bruce Boyd from the Columbia Power Company dated October 18, 1939\n6. Copy of letter addressed to Mr. Jackson from Mr. Bruce Boyd dated October 19, 1939\n\nYou will note from Mr. Ball's letter of September 9, 1938, that there was no mention of any expenditure in connection with obtaining the power from the Columbia Power Company Limited except the installation of two engines. Subsequently it was decided that one engine would be sufficient and this was purchased in December, 1938.\n\nWe heard nothing further from Mr. Ball with regard to any expenditure in this connection until we received his letter of June 8. You will note that in that letter he intimates that all the authority for the expenditure was given by the Principal of the Sechelt school.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that in the letter of the Columbia Power Company dated October 18 they state as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Ball gave instructions to our superintendent at that time to proceed with such work as might be necessary for making the change over.\"\n\nPlease investigate the matter fully and let me know the reason for the difference in Mr. Ball's letter and the Company's letter regarding the authorization of the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should also interview the Principal of the Sechelt residential school and obtain his version of the transaction. A complete report should then be submitted to the Department and at the same time you should state whether or not you consider the Columbia Power Company's account should be paid by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-5\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st July last regarding expenditure on the furnace at Sechelt Indian Residential School. This work has now been done, and a voucher is being forwarded.\n\nWith regard to the carpentry work mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter, I attached to my letter of July 5th some papers covering this work, and asked for the return of the same, but they have not been received. Will you kindly return them at your convenience? Mr. Morley, who made up the estimate, has since left the school.\n\nI suggest that before any carpentry repair work is authorized at Sechelt School the electric light matter be settled. You have returned the bills for this work, amounting to $493.88, saying that there are no funds available, and the School must pay for it, which the School refused to do as much of the expense was in renewing the old wiring in the school before the Columbia Power Company turned on power from their system as they considered it a distinct fire hazard to use the old wiring. There was an implication in your original letter to carry on with the work of connecting with the Power Company, and discontinuing the use of the diesel engine and batteries. Two electric motors were ordered by the Department and duly installed. Possibly any money now available for repairs to Sechelt Residential School could be applied on this electric lighting system bill already incurred.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.G.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo the Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 10622. It will be necessary to give more details regarding the charge of $17.75 for materials. With regard to the item of $15.25 for labour you should show the number of hours employed, the rate per hour and the exact dates on which the work was done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Bell,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Bell:\n\nDuring the present term I would appreciate having the following repairs carried out in the School:\n\n1. The kitchen roof. It is leaking very badly and the plaster has commenced to fall from the ceiling. We have attempted temporary repairs but owing to the rotted tin and moss, a complete new roofing job must be done.\n\n2. The plaster on the walls of the boys and girls recreation halls is falling off in large pieces. It is swelling in several places and so we expect that by spring there will be very little plaster on at least two of these walls.\n\n3. In the laundry large pieces of plaster have fallen from the walls and ceiling. The walls where the plaster is still good are very black, no doubt to the fumes from the old oil burning dryer which was in use here some years ago. This room should be completely replastered.\n\n4. The main roof is covered with a thick growth of moss. This has penetrated through the shingles and I feel that the roof should be examined and the necessary repairs made.\n\nI would sincerely appreciate your bringing these matters to the attention of the Department, particularly the first item.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n\"E.J.

The moss is a fire hazard in the dry months, and should be removed. Until this is done, I cannot say in what condition we shall find the shingles. It is difficult, therefore, to give an estimate of cost. The kitchen roof must be reshingled, but this will be a minor matter, costing approximately $50.00.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that, if any funds are available for repairs at this School, an estimate be obtained in detail for each job, but until the question is settled regarding payment of the electrical work ordered by the school I presume no funds will be available for repairs for the present.\n\nIn June, 1930, the roof was repaired, all cracked and broken shingles replaced, moss cleaned off and the entire roof shingle-stained, at a cost of $350.00 for labour and material, almost equally divided. At that time, the then Reverend Principal applied for new shingles for the roof, but I suggested cleaning and staining as the shingles were only 8 years old, and they have lasted over 9 years longer. It is probable that after 17 years, they may be in bad shape, as the moss is destructive, and in this climate, cannot be avoided.\n\nAt present prices of shingles, it would cost to re-shingle the whole building with best grade shingles as follows:\n\n- 12,000 No.1 5x Shingles @ $3.35 per m........$402.00\n- Shingle nails, galv.iron, etc........15.00\n- Labour, approx.....................200.00\n- Freight, approx....................25.00\n\n$642.00\n\nI cannot estimate the various plastering jobs as that would depend upon what amount of work could be done, and also whether the various rooms could be patched up or whether they would require completely re-plastering. It is useless to consider any plastering unless the roof is first repaired or renewed.\n\nIf you will give me some idea of what money, if any, is available for repair work at this School, I could give a more detailed report, as to how it could best be expended.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1939.\n\nEXD.\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Ball with reference to the Sechelt Indian residential school.

C.\nI visited Sechelt Reserve twice, where there is serious trouble between a logging company and the Union Steamship Co. regarding a water system. We are only indirectly interested as the Union S.S. Co. supply water to the Residential school. However, another logging company was felling timber on the reserve pipe line on a timber limit adjoining the reserve, and had damaged our pipe line. I persuaded the logging operator to employ Indians to do his felling, and seven were given jobs. I then advised them that if they damaged their own pipe line they would be without water. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily although the other companies are going to Court, I believe.\n\nF. J. C.

As instructed, I have enquired into the circumstances involved in the company's claim for payment of this account and beg to report thereon.\n\nIt might be as well for the purposes of this report to summarize briefly the correspondence on file in connection with this matter:\n\n(1) Sept. 9, 1938.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ball recommended direct to the Department that the operation of the school's power plant be discontinued and the school's electric power requirements be secured from the Columbia Power Co., Ltd. In the same letter the Agent stated that the company offered full service at $35.00 per month which included, \"lighting at the school, barn, priest's residence and staff house, and power for two motors in the refrigerator and laundry.\"\n\n(2) Sept. 22nd, 1938.\n\nThe Department advised Mr. Ball that the proposed arrangement should be carried out and approved of supplying two small motors at an approximate cost of $150.00.\n\n(3) June 8th, 1939.\n\nAn account for $493.88 covering costs involved in the change over to the Columbia Power Co., Ltd. was forwarded\n\nDr. H.

In the above dated letter accompanying the account the Agent stated that he authorized the Columbia Power Co. to remove the old plant. Further, that from \"this point\" the Rev. Principal acting in good faith, but without advising him, instructed the Company as to what work was required.\n\n(4) July 8th, 1939.\n\nThe Department advised Mr. Ball that as the work was undertaken without authority and as no provision had been made in the current year's appropriation to take care of the item, that payment of the Company's account could not be considered.\n\n(5) October 18th, 1939.\n\nThe Columbia Power Co. placed the account in the hands of the Company's solicitor, Mr. Bruce Boyd, for collection. It will be observed that the company's letter to Mr. Boyd includes the following statement, \"Mr. Ball gave instructions to our Superintendent at that time to proceed with such work as might be necessary for making the change over.\"\n\nMy investigation leads me to advise the Department as follows:\n\n(1) There is no record of the Department having authorized the expenditure involved in the Columbia Power Company's account or any part of it.\n\n(2) No estimate was secured by the Agent from the Company as to the costs the Department or the school or both would be required to meet in connection with the change over to the Company's system.\n\n(3) No agreement exists between the Agent's office and the Company, or the School and the Company, with respect to the costs involved in connecting up with company's system or the payment of such costs.\n\n(4) Whatever was done at the school by the Company at the request of the Principal was on the understanding that the Company had the requisite Departmental authority to do whatever work was required to install the equipment and make such changes as were considered necessary as a result of the change over to the Company's system.\n\n(5) ....\nThe materials and equipment listed in the company's account were used in the school buildings, school grounds and making the connection between the company's transmission line on the public road to the school property.\n\nThe new wiring, repairs, extension and equipment provided by the company at the school were necessary to provide better service and adequate protection against outbreaks of fire from the system.\n\nAn amount of $17.64 included in the account in question was spent by the company for Indian labour.\n\nThe wiring, etc., done by the Company at the school was carried out by experienced workmen and is regarded as satisfactory.\n\nReferring to the penultimate paragraph of your letter, my opinion is, and such is all that I can give in the absence of corroborative information, that Mr. Ball did instruct the company to proceed to make the necessary connection to the school to supply power, but did not intend this authority to extend to the new wiring, repairs and extensions in the school buildings, which the company proceeded to do at the request of the principal and on the assumption that the authority given by Mr. Ball did include such work.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\nAs the amount involved is about what the Department would have paid for a new set of batteries, which would have been required for the school plant had the change over not taken place, and, as the maintenance costs of the school's plant hitherto borne by the Department have been eliminated as a result of the change over, thus effecting a saving to the Department, and further that changes were necessary in the wiring to pass provincial inspection, I would recommend payment of the company's account less the 10% charge on \"overhead and profit.\" This deduction would amount to $44.87, and in my opinion is not a fair charge against the Department, inasmuch as we could have purchased the materials at wholesale rates ourselves and secured competent labour at the same rate per hour or less than the company paid.\n\nIn conclusion...\nIn conclusion I should like to observe that this particular case has taken time that should have been available for other work and involved expense that would not have been necessary had very ordinary precautions and business methods been employed from the beginning in dealing with the matter.\n\nI was not advised by the Department of the proposed changes nor asked to pass upon them. Had this office been consulted in the matter, as it might well have been and in my opinion should be in such matters from an administrative point of view, the results would have been satisfactory both to the Department and the company.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

Principal acting in good faith, but without advising him, instructed the Company as to what work was required.\n\n(4) July 8th, 1939.\n\nThe Department advised Mr. Ball that as the work was undertaken without authority and as no provision had been made in the current year's appropriation to take care of the item, that payment of the Company's account could not be considered.\n\n(5) October 18th, 1939.\n\nThe Columbia Power Co. placed the account in the hands of the Company's solicitor, Mr. Bruce Boyd, for collection. It will be observed that the company's letter to Mr. Boyd includes the following statement, \"Mr. Ball gave instructions to our Superintendent at that time to proceed with such work as might be necessary for making the change over.\"\n\nMy investigation leads me to advise the Department as follows:\n\n(1) There is no record of the Department having authorized the expenditure involved in the Columbia Power Company's account or any part of it.\n\n(2) No estimate was secured by the Agent from the Company as to the costs the Department or the school or both would be required to meet in connection with the change over to the Company's system.\n\n(3) No agreement exists between the Agent's office and the Company, or the School and the Company, with respect to the costs involved in connecting up with company's system or the payment of such costs.\n\n(4) Whatever was done at the school by the Company at the request of the Principal was on the understanding that the Company had the requisite Departmental authority to do whatever work was required to install the equipment and make such changes as were considered necessary as a result of the change over to the Company's system.\n\n(5) ...\nThe materials and equipment listed in the company's account were used in the school buildings, school grounds and making the connection between the company's transmission line on the public road to the school property.\n\nThe new wiring, repairs, extension and equipment provided by the company at the school were necessary to provide better service and adequate protection against outbreaks of fire from the system.\n\nAn amount of $17.64 included in the account in question was spent by the company for Indian labour.\n\nThe wiring, etc., done by the Company at the school was carried out by experienced workmen and is regarded as satisfactory.\n\nReferring to the penultimate paragraph of your letter, my opinion is, and such is all that I can give in the absence of corroborative information, that Mr. Ball did instruct the company to proceed to make the necessary connection to the school to supply power, but did not intend this authority to extend to the new wiring, repairs and extensions in the school buildings, which the company proceeded to do at the request of the principal and on the assumption that the authority given by Mr. Ball did include such work.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\nAs the amount involved is about what the Department would have paid for a new set of batteries, which would have been required for the school plant had the change over not taken place, and, as the maintenance costs of the school's plant hitherto borne by the Department have been eliminated as a result of the change over, thus effecting a saving to the Department, and further that changes were necessary in the wiring to pass provincial inspection, I would recommend payment of the company's account less the 10% charge on \"overhead and profit.\" This deduction would amount to $44.87, and in my opinion is not a fair charge against the Department, inasmuch as we could have purchased the materials at wholesale rates ourselves and secured competent labour at the same rate per hour or less than the company paid.\n\nIn conclusion ...\nIn conclusion I should like to observe that this particular case has taken time that should have been available for other work and involved expense that would not have been necessary had very ordinary precautions and business methods been employed from the beginning in dealing with the matter.\n\nI was not advised by the Department of the proposed changes nor asked to pass upon them. Had this office been consulted in the matter, as it might well have been and in my opinion should be in such matters from an administrative point of view, the results would have been satisfactory both to the Department and the company.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the account submitted by the Columbia Power Company for materials and labour supplied in connection with the installation at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been carefully noted and although no authority was given for this expenditure the Department is prepared to consider payment of the account.\n\nHowever, I regret that at the present time owing to lack of funds it is impossible to issue cheque in payment. I feel, however, that the school authorities should be willing to co-operate with us in this regard by paying the Columbia Power Company and submitting the receipted account to us after the first of April at which time the amount will be refunded to the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Ball,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nIt is unfortunate that conditions prohibit the outlay necessary to recondition our plumbing in the school, since it is in a serious state of disintegration. However, we can fully understand the difficulties with which the Department must be faced at the present time, and we will do our best to carry out repairs in so far as we are able until such time as these materials are available.\n\nThe following articles are the most essential:\n\n1 bbl. roofing tar for kitchen roof\n100 ft. galvanized tin down pipe 3\"\n1 pipe reamer\n1 pipe wrench 12\"\n5 gals. green roofing paint.\n\nMr. Stanton, the manual training instructor, is being retained by us for the summer vacation period to do this work and he has a suggestion to make regarding the staining of the main roof. When you come up again we can discuss the matter with him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"E.J. Cornell,\" O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School. He sent me a long list of plumbing supplies which amounted to several hundred dollars, which I could not recommend, but the repairs mentioned are an immediate necessity to protect the building (except the green roofing paint). The down pipe has rotted away and the rain runs down the side of the building, which is of brick, and causes some dampness inside.\n\nThe cost would be approximately $30.00 delivered to Sechelt, including freight, and I understand the labour is free.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of the letter, the roof was re-shingled recently, but has not painted. I discussed with the Reverend Principal the matter he refers to. The man mentioned, Mr. Stanton, says he can make an oil stain or shinglozen for about $25.00 sufficient to cover the new shingles, and the portion of the building for which he asks for five gallons of green roofing paint. It is a debatable question whether shingles are made more enduring by painting, although, of course, the appearance of the building is much improved by staining.\n\nI quite understand the difficulty of providing funds for any purpose, and will not send any applications to the Department unless they are to save more expense later.\n\nI respectfully recommend that the above expenses be authorized.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to a letter received from the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School regarding plumbing work required at the school.\n\nAs we had some funds available for repairs at this school, Indian Commissioner MacKay was instructed to expend an amount not exceeding $200.00 in purchasing the most necessary plumbing materials. It is understood that the school management will look after the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. J. C.

Under these circumstances, I feel that you should proceed with the purchase of the plumbing materials required to the amount authorized. You should include in the materials already requested the following:\n\n1 bbl. roofing tar for kitchen roof,\n100 ft. galvanized tin down pipe 3\",\n1 pipe reamer,\n1 pipe wrench 12\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

It is considered that you should have made a definite recommendation regarding the Principal's request and also supplied detailed information regarding the type of boiler required so that an order could be placed if funds were available. If you had done so it would have obviated the necessity of writing this letter to obtain the information mentioned in the preceding sentence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

On the last occasion it burst late at night, causing much alarm and confusion among the staff.\n\nThe 100-gallon boiler, or tank, actually contains 77 Imperial gallons and the price in Vancouver is $50.10 for the standard and $57.10 for extra heavy galvanized iron. There would be no labour cost involved and as this is a necessity, I would recommend that it be supplied.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant you may purchase a hot water tank for the Sechelt Residential School at a cost not exceeding $57.10.

To date I do not think that any steps have been taken to have these repairs done and as I think that many of these are urgent for the upkeep of the buildings, I am taking up the matter with you with the hope that you will be able to have this work done. I should like to make a few further remarks in connection with the enclosed list.\n\n1. Laundry -\n   I think the proper thing to do about the Laundry, the condition of which is really disgraceful, would be to have it completely replastered. However, as expert labour would be required for this, it would possibly be as well if we were to give it one or two coats of extra heavy wall paint which work we could do ourselves. We would require about 15 gals of paint but it would have to be the heavy wall paint like that used on cement. We would also require about 10 gals of sizing. I think a light buff would be a suitable colour for the paint. We would also need about half a dozen brushes.\n\n2. Roof -\n   The roof over the kitchen, pantry and Laundry is flat and gravelled. The galvanized iron all around the edges is corroded and the rain leaks through to the ceiling and the walls. This would have to be repaired before we could repair the Laundry. About 75 or 100 ft. of 3 ft. galvanized iron would be required. We would also need a barrel of hard tar.\n\n3. Floor -\n   We have patched up the holes in the floor of the boys' recreation hall with cement and I think it will do for a while.\n\n4. Manual Training shop -\n   The shop is still an eye-sore for lack of paint. We would need about 10 gals of flesh tint exterior paint, about 1 gal of white and about 5 gals of shingle stain.\n\n5. Toilet tanks -\n   These have deteriorated still more and are urgently needed for sanitation. Eleven required.\n\n6. Refrigeration Plant -\n   We have done more work on this and although it is better, it still takes an excessive amount of power to keep the supplies cool.\n\n7. Land clearing -\n   We have not been able to make much headway with the clearing of our land and I think that a more practical plan to have it clear would be to hire a local bull-dozer which would cost about $50.00 an acre. We cannot afford to hire it and badly need the land for pasturage.\n\n8. School building -\n   Nothing has been done to stain the newly shingled roof of the main school building and I'm afraid it will deteriorate.\nunless steps are taken to have it stained. I haven't any definite figure on the amount of stain required but I imagine it would take about 50 or 60 gals.\n\nWe are of course quite anxious to do all we can to see to the upkeep of the property but last year's cut in our Grant has made it impossible for us to undertake any of these major repairs and the best we can do is to supply the labour. The interior of the school itself is very much in need of a thorough paint job but as this has more to do with the appearance than any deterioration, I think this is one thing which can wait, in view of the present war effort. However if it would be at all possible to procure for us about 10 gals of cream wall paint and 10 gals of medium green wall paint we could make at least the main entrances more presentable to the many visitors we have here.\n\nHoping that you will be successful in obtaining these things for us and thanking you for past favours, I am,\n\nSincerely yours\n\nJ.M. McGrath O.M.S.\nPrincipal\n\nEnc. 1\nOttawa, September 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year, it was only found possible to include an item of $200.00 for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment at this school.

The laundry is in deplorable condition, and the roof above it must be repaired before the rainy season. This wing of the building has a flat roof and cannot be shingled. The following items are required:\n\n**Material - For Laundry**\n\n1 sack \"Gilt Edge\" plaster of paris  \n1 \" hydrated lime  \n1 \" cement  \n4 gals. filler or sealing liquid  \n8 \" gloss, oil and lead paint\n\n**For Laundry Roof**\n\n1 roll heavy felt roofing paper  \n1 bbl. roofing pitch (asphalt)  \n4 sheets 4' x 8' 26 gauge galv. iron  \n4 gals. white gasoline for torch\n\n**Labour - 1. Taking off remaining plaster on west laundry wall, making good other walls and ceiling. Sealing (inside) the surface and give the whole laundry 2 coats of good paint ........................................ $75.00**\n\n**Labour - 2. Repairing roof, tar and gravel, take off portion of iron all around parapet and insert new flashings, re-lay and put roof in perfect shape (gravel obtained free from beach). $65.00**\n\n**FOR THE MAIN BUILDING:**\n\n**Material - 150 lbs. Red Oxide dry**  \n65 gals. boiled linseed oil\n\n**Labour - Shingle staining whole roof of school....$75.00**\n\nI have gone carefully into this question of repairs with the new Principal, and he agrees that this work is the most essential and is urgent. The former Principal, Rev. J.M. McGrath, was anxious to do this work before he left and\nhad tried to find someone capable of doing the job, which\nthe new Principal, Father Dunlop, and I have now done, and\nhe has given us the above figures for labour, which are\nmuch lower than any figures obtained before; there is\nno question that the work will be done satisfactorily.\n\nYour early instructions will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of the 24th ultimo requesting authority for the carrying out of repair work on Sechelt Indian Residential School. Quotations have been secured on the material required, except galvanized iron and gasoline in connection with which there is some difficulty at the moment, and these amount to:\n\n- Material: $118.42\n- Labour: $215.00\n\nEnclosed herewith are quotations received from hardware wholesalers in Vancouver of which Messrs. Gordon and Belyea are able to supply the greater part of the material.\n\nI would recommend that an encumbrance for $350.00 be set up for the repair of this school to provide for quotations as above and for the material on which I have not yet been able to secure same.\n\nThere has been very little maintenance work carried out on this school during recent years and in consequence repairs are now becoming most urgent in order to avoid rapid and costly deterioration of the building.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to repairs required at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding $350.00 for material and labour in making these repairs. When forwarding the voucher covering the cost of material, you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 1st, 1942.\n\nMr. F. J. Ball,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am submitting estimates on repairs necessary for the good maintenance of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\na) 11 toilets --------------------- $430.00\nb) Refrigeration plant repairs --- $200.00\nc) Paint interior ----------------- $150.00\n   Exterior ---------------------- $30.00\nd) Drain pipe for dairy --------- $50.00\ne) Oil & Varnish for ext. doors -- $15.00\nf) Land clearing ------------------ $600.00\n\nTotal $1,475.00\n\na) Re. Toilets: For several years the sanitary condition of the toilets has been quite bad. On one occasion since my arrival here, the toilets in the boys wash room overflowed, and before the condition could be detected and checked, the dirty water from the toilets seeped through to the room below which we had just finished redecorating, undoing most of our work, and finally reached the dining room, splattering one of the tables. The local plumber, Mr. Hoad, assures me that the toilets throughout the house are completely worn out, and because the make is old and obsolete parts cannot be obtained for them. I recommend new toilets throughout the house as an immediate necessity. Toilets which will not flush sometimes, and which will overflow at other times are a danger to the health of the children, not to speak of the damage they are doing to the plaster on the rooms below. The figure given would include the labor of putting them in.\n\nb) Re. refrigeration plant. We are unable to keep meat for any length of time in our refrigerator, after ten or twelve days the meat becomes blue-mouldy. The insulation in the box has deteriorated, and some of the piping will have to be renewed.\n\nc) Re. Paint; Practically every room in the house is in need of paint. We have redecorated a few rooms on our own accord but we could not begin to do them all. The following rooms in my estimation are in greatest need of paint; girls' side; recreation hall, sewing room, Boys' side; staircase, dining-hall, and dormitory. Exterior: The manual training-shop needs repainting.\n\nd) Re. drain-pipe: There is no drain-pipe in our dairy, and as a consequence it is impossible to clean the floor properly.\n\ne) Re. Oil and Varnish: There are three exterior doors which are exposed to the weather. These doors require oiling and varnishing.\nf) Re. Land Clearing: There are ten acres of land adjoining the school which could be used for pasture if cleared. We have no pasture for our dairy stock. Unable to obtain tea for the children we have substituted milk. This has necessitated doubling the number of our cows. The price of hay is exceptionally high, especially here where the cost of freighting is great. It would undoubtably be a good investment to have this land cleared by means of a bull-dozer which could be had for $60.00 per acre. The land as it stands is of no practical use whatsoever.\n\nIn submitting the above estimates I have kept in mind two things. Firstly, the health and training of the children. For example, the toilet rooms which are damp for the most part are an excellent breeding ground for bacteria; and which despite our efforts to the contrary are often times quite odoriferous, cannot but be a menace to the health of the children. In training the children to desire what is clean and wholesome, it is apparent that their surroundings at school should excel in this very thing. Secondly, I have not overlooked the fact that the department is especially anxious during war time, to keep down unnecessary expenses since Canada needs all available monies to carry on her part in the prosecution of the present war. For these reasons I have submitted only those items which I feel to be absolutely necessary, and in all of them I have given the lowest possible figure, with the intention of using whenever possible our own labor.\n\nMoreover, it would seem to be false economy to allow the buildings and surroundings to continue to deteriorate. If the cost of repairs is fourteen hundred now, it will surely not be less after the war when the government is struggling to readjust itself economically.\n\nI realize I am late in submitting the above. However, I received my appointment here only in August. It was necessary to observe all the condition to determine what was of primary importance.\n\nEnclosed please find two copies for your convenience in forwarding same to the department in Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of the enclosed letter from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School. This building is the property of the Department.\n\nThe repairs listed are necessary, but I have not checked the cost, except for item (a) $430.00 which is approximately correct - if the materials can be obtained. This amount includes labour and materials. There is certainly an effluvia from these toilets at times, and the original installation was badly done.\n\nThe refrigerating plant has given trouble for some time, and the former Principal used to keep it going under difficulties. Until someone with a knowledge of such plants has checked up on it, I can give no close estimate of the cost, and I think the Principal's figure can be only an outside guess.\n\nThere is no question but that some painting should be done inside the building, and the exterior doors oiled and stained to protect them from the weather, but the figure shown can be scaled down, if necessary. Part of this painting and other work is due to damage caused by the toilets overflowing and seeping down to the floors beneath, including the refectory.\n\nWith regard to the land clearing, the 10 acres would no doubt make good pasture land for the cows which the former Principal purchased. He took over a Japanese dairy ranch near the School, and they use that for pasture also. The 10 acres is mostly covered with small trees and stumps and $600.00 should clear it for seeding to clover. A small part of the area has been cleared by the pupils and school employees but the work is too heavy for small boys.\n\nI would recommend that, if at all possible, the above work be done, especially the plumbing work, which is a health consideration. The amount spent on this School has been very moderate in the past, and I hope you will give it your favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing Indian Agent Ball's letter of the 5th instant, requesting an expenditure of $1475.00 for repairs at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. This is the first intimation that the Department has received that such extensive repairs are necessary at this school. No such information was contained in the Indian Agent's estimates for the current fiscal year and consequently we only approved an amount of $100.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Sechelt School. We have already authorized an amount of $350.00 and this was only possible by taking the excess of $250.00 from a small unallotted amount in our appropriation. The funds at our disposal will permit very little further expenditure, but on reviewing the matter I believe that we can allow another $200.00. You may decide on which of the items listed this amount should be spent. However, I may say that the Department does not favour spending any money at the present time for land clearing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M.

This cheque is sufficiently large to permit you to pay for the unemployment insurance stamps. You should then forward the usual credit voucher to account for the cheque.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nre: Sechelt Indian Residential School\n\nI beg to advise that the Reverend Principal of this School has requested some extra hose and two fire axes for fire protection. At the last fire drill, evacuation was made at night in 3 minutes, and a full practice carried out. The hose they now have did not reach all the buildings. Three extra lengths would give protection to the Council House and Church on the Reserve in addition to all the school buildings.\n\nIn the event of fire, there is no other assistance to be expected and they have an excellent fire-fighting team. At present they are making a hose reel as none can be purchased here.\n\nThis Reserve and School being on the Coast, there is some apprehension among the people that it might suffer from enemy action if mistaken for barracks or other military building, and their fears have been accentuated since the shelling of Estevan by a submarine.\n\nI am placing the request before you for your consideration, although you advised me some time ago that fire hose was not available at that time. I presume the fire axes will be authorized as that is a small matter, and respectfully recommend that the hose also be supplied if possible. The size required is No.3, 2\u00bd inches, 300 lbs. pressure, 3 lengths needed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Supplies, Sechelt Residential School\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received from Indian Agent Hall. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn this connection I should like to refer you to Departmental letter dated October 15, 1942. In view of existing conditions it is exceedingly difficult for the Department to provide supplies or undertake repairs at any of our schools, unless provision has been made for these supplies and repairs in the regular estimates. A great many repairs have been undertaken at Sechelt during the course of the year for which no provision whatever had been made.\n\nWe are naturally anxious, however, to do everything humanly possible to safeguard our buildings from destruction by fire. If you can secure the 3 lengths of hose which appears to be urgently needed, you are authorized to do so. The fire axes should also be purchased.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The floors are of concrete with a sort of asphalt finish. They are dusty, unsanitary, cold, and homeless looking. Their grey prison-like appearance are definitely demoralizing. I suggest a wooden floor, a composition floor -- any kind of a floor except the kind they are at present. They are cold and damp for the children to sit on while playing games. They give off clouds of dust when run upon. They cannot be made to appear clean. I suggest this item as our first and greatest need, since it has a direct bearing on the health of the children. I am unable to give an approximate estimate on the cost of this work.\n\nIn making up the above estimates I have kept in mind the necessity of keeping down expenses. However the building is in rather poor repair generally. There is a great deal of work to be done. I have suggested only what I felt to be most necessary for the present.\n\nEnclosed please find two copies for your convenience in forwarding same to Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. F.

These estimates have been made by Mr. Hoad, the local contractor. The figures given include the cost of labour, where the nature of the work would require skilled labour, as in the case of plastering, etc. The type of paint suggested is \"Vello\" (for interior) Vello being economical and easy to apply, yet quite practical.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Interior decoration and repairs           | $641.00|\n| Paint ext. and repairs                    | $369.00|\n| Gyproc                                    | $120.00|\n| V.

Joint.\n   Due to bad plaster part of the wall was done with V. Joint.\n   The remainder of the wall is need of same now. -- $35.00\n\n2) Gyproc Girls Sewing room. The plaster for the main part is beyond repair. Gyproc being less expensive, more durable, and obtainable -- $55.00\n\n3) Finish balance of wall in Junior Girls play hall. The same condition exists as in the Junior Boy's hall --- $35.00\n\n4) Vello Junior class room -- $36.00\n\n5) Gyproc Senior Girl's Dormitory. The plaster is in very bad repair. Part has fallen, and a great portion is quite loose -- $70.00\n\n6) Repair plaster and vello Girl's infirmary -- $40.00\n\n7) Vello and repair plaster in Senior and Junior Boy's dormitory, plus repair to wall board -- $100.00\n\n8) Vello and repair Senior Boy's class room -- $50.00\n\n9) Paint, varnish, repair plaster, and wall board of both the Boy's and girl's stair wells -- $225.00\n\n10) Paint and varnish corridor of 1st. floor -- $175.00\n\n11) Paint and varnish entrance hall -- $80.00\n\n12) Paint scullery -- $20.00\n\n13) Vello Men's refactory -- $20.00\n\n14) Rebuild and paint fire escape, i.e. the small fire escape on boy's side. This fire escape has been condemned as it is unsafe to carry more than five boys -- $54.00\n\n15) Paint main fire escapes on boy's and on girl's side -- $90.00\n\n16) Paint manual training shop -- $120.00. This building in its present condition is a terrible eye-sore. It gives neglected run-down appearance to the whole place, and besides the unprotected lumber is suffering a great deal from the weather.\n\n17) Install 4 Panic Locks on the four fire escape doors. The doors as are, must be either left open (unlocked) or locked by key. Fire regulations prevent latter. It is a great worry to me that the doors be left unlocked on the girl's side during the night recalling that a drunken man walked into the Senior Girl's dormitory, at one O'clock one night last winter. -- $60.00\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith letter dated the 27th ultimo addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Ball by the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School requesting authority to expend $1365.00 for repairs to his school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me if this work or any portion of same could be undertaken from funds available for the current year.\n\nD.M.

When forwarding\naccounts, you should attach copy of the purchase order.\nIf any of this amount is to be spent for wages, the\nDepartment is prepared to forward you an accountable\ncheque.\n\nWhile I am only authorizing at the present\ntime the amount specifically provided in the current\nyear's appropriation, it is possible that we may be\nable to allow another $100.00 or $150.00 later in the\nyear, when we are more fully aware of our commitments\nat other schools.\n\nI was particularly interested in the last\nportion of the Principal's letter, in which he refers to\nthe floors in the four play halls. We have recently\nexamined plastic tile, manufactured by the Storror\nManufacturing Company, Weston, Ontario. This can be\nlaid over concrete floors, and it is evident from the\nfloors that our officials have examined that the dust\nnuisance is stopped. I am writing to the firm mentioned\nand requesting them to communicate with you, giving you\nfull particulars regarding the material and its cost.\nPossibly you are aware of other material that would be\nsatisfactory, but I thought you might like to know of\nthis firm's product.\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON VANCOUVER INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH AUGUST, 1943.\n\nOn the 6th I met the Rev. Fr. Scannell, Provincial of the O.M.I., at Sechelt Residential School, where he visited for the day. We are trying to make some badly needed repairs at this school, but on account of lack of sufficient money and scarcity of labour and material, this is proving a difficult job.\n\nFred J.C.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of July 6, with reference to the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. Since that time we have only received one account covering the cost of repairing the refrigerating plant. I should appreciate your advising the other repairs that you have authorized and also if the expenditure that you consider necessary will exceed the $500.00 mentioned in our previous letter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 66007- B.C.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing Salvage Minute No. 25859, covering Vertical Boiler, which in my letter of the 5th instant I recommended be transferred to the Sechelt Indian Residential School, but pointed out that repair work would be necessary on the same to the extent of about $50.00, and that possibly another $25.00 would be required to cover the transportation from the Penitentiary to the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me if these repairs and transportation charges are authorized.\n\nFor: D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 25, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, I regret that in previous correspondence I did not approve the expenditure required to repair the vertical boiler secured from the British Columbia Penitentiary.\n\nThis letter authorizes an expenditure of approximately $75.00 to repair the boiler and transport it to the Sechelt School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 22nd 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nre: Sechelt Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the allowance of $500.00 granted for repairs to Sechelt Indian Residential School, the original requisition, dated May 27th 1943, showed a list amounting to $1365.00. When you advised me that only $500.00 would be available, I went into this matter carefully with the Reverend Principal to see which jobs required attention first and we agreed upon the following:\n\n1. Replacing old fire escape on west side of the building as ordered by the fire inspector - $75.00. (This is imperative because the old escape is unsafe and could not be used in case of fire).\n\n2. Flooring the two lower floor rooms on the boys' and girls' side - $225.00. (These rooms are cement floored and dampness has broken up the cement. The only solution is a wooden floor on tarred joists).\n\n3. Repairing the walls and giving them a coating of \"vello\" of a similar casein paint - $100.00\n\n4. Repairing the refrigeration plant - $100.00.\n\nTotal cost .......$500.00.\n\nThis latter job was not included in the original estimate of $1365.00, but was vitally necessary to protect the meat, milk, and other perishables when school re-opened. This job has been completed and bills sent in.\n\nItems 1 and 2 are being done at the present time. It has been a difficult task to obtain both material and labour but this has been overcome and the work is well under way. These figures include labour and material.\n\nAfter these jobs are completed, there are many places where the plaster has fallen off and should be repaired, and\nconsiderable interior work of this kind should be done. However, a priority painting job is that on the main fire escapes. Unless these are protected from the weather, they cannot be expected to last long.\n\nI would recommend that these fire escapes be painted as soon as funds are available, the cost would be $125.00 for labour and material, including the painting of the new fire escape mentioned previously.\n\nFour panic locks are required on the fire escape doors. At present the doors have to be kept unlocked and this permitted an intoxicated Indian to enter the girls' dormitory at 1 a.m. last winter. These locks should be installed at a cost of $60.00.\n\nAll the dormitories require repairs to the plaster and a coat of vello, not only for appearance, but for reasons of cleanliness. It is not easy to give the exact costs in work of this kind, but the nearest estimate for labour and material that I have been able to obtain is $45.00 for each room, or $270.00 in all.\n\nThere is considerable plaster repair work to be done in the halls and if this is done, the halls will also have to be given a coat of vello. Some varnishing will also be necessary and the cost would be approximately $350.00.\n\nThe Reverend Principal was anxious to have the manual training building near the school given protection against the weather by painting. It has never been painted, and would require considerable paint and oil. Vello would not be suitable here. It would cost $145.00 to do this job. The original estimate by the Principal was $120.00 but it would require three coats, whereas he figured on two only.\n\nTo sum up, the cost, in order of importance, of work above the $500.00 already allotted would be as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Painting all fire escapes     | $125.00|\n| Panic locks                   | $60.00 |\n| Repairs to dormitories        | $270.00|\n| Repairs and renovations of halls | $350.00|\n| Painting manual training building | $145.00|\n\nTotal........ $950.00\n\nI would appreciate advice as to what items shown above can be provided for in addition to the work being done at present.\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to your letter of the 14th instant,\nfile 167-18-5, regarding the amount provided in the current\nyear's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the\nSechelt Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian\nAgent Ball's letter of the 22nd instant advising how the amount\nof $500.00 provided is being expended and also setting out\nfurther items amounting to $950.00 in the order of their priority\nand requesting further funds if they could be provided. As the\nmaintenance work on this school is very much in arrears, I would\nrecommend approval of as many of the additional items as can be\nprovided for.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to repairs and improvements required at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. I have noted the manner in which you intend to expend the amount of $500.00 already authorized.\n\nThe following expenditures are also approved:\n\nPainting fire escapes .................... $125.00\nPanic locks .................................. 60.00\nRepairs to dormitories ..................... 270.00\nRepairs and renovation of halls .......... 350.00\n\n$805.00\n\nI presume that you will be dealing with different firms in handling this business and that a copy of your purchase order will be attached to each account.\n\nIn regard to painting the manual training building, I am not certain if the quotation mentioned, namely, $145.00, includes both material and labour. If it includes only material, the Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure, but, if it includes both material and labour, you may purchase the paint required and the labour should be given free of cost by the boys in the vocational training class.\n\nR.A.

We have had only one man working on the job. Fortunately he is able to do all the various jobs entailed in this project and has been most satisfactory in every way (I may say that when he is finished at the School, the Roman Catholic authorities have engaged him to build their own Church at Sechelt).\n\nThe point now is that we cannot finish before March 31st all the work authorized. To March 18th we have expended $853.40 leaving a balance of $451.60, for labour, all the material having been purchased. About $85.00 more will be expended in labour by March 31st. Will you please advise me what we should do, as I do not want the work left incomplete? There is keen satisfaction at the school with what we have done up to date, and it would be unfortunate if a matter of book-keeping is to stop further progress.\n\nI would request also that the Department be asked (by air mail) for a further advance of $315.00 in order that wages may be paid to March 31st when all advances to date will be accounted for in the usual way. The man who is doing the work has been approached also by the Union S.S. Co. and several private individuals to do building and other work for them, so you will understand why I am anxious that we do not have to let him go.\n\nAn extra copy of this letter is enclosed and early action will be appreciated.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nB/DH.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of even date advising that owing to labour difficulties it will be impossible to expend the full amount provided for the repair of Sechelt Indian Residential School. While all the material has been purchased, there will be an unexpended balance in the labour account of $368.50 at the end of the month, it being impossible to complete the work within the current fiscal year. Mr. Ball requests that if at all possible this amount be provided for the carrying out of the work immediately on the opening of the new fiscal year in order that the man working on the repairs can remain on the job until it is completed as he feels that if this is not done it may be some considerable time before he will again be available or another man could be secured owing to the difficult labour situation.\n\nI would recommend approval of this application if the money can be provided as requested. You advice by air mail would be appreciated.\n\nFor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M.

Funds to the amount\nmentioned will be charged against our 1944-45\nappropriation and consequently the work can\ncontinue.\n\nPlease forward immediately the account\nof $315 mentioned by Mr. Ball in his letter.\nThe Treasury Branch does not favour issuing\naccountable advances at such a late date in\nthe fiscal year.\n\nR.A.

C.\n\nre: File 215-14-2567\n\nWith reference to the attached vouchers, these are made out as they have always been, and the Department has paid similar vouchers without question.\n\nVoucher No. 567 is a Credit Voucher, and we have accounted for advances in this manner on many jobs in the past and there have been no objections from Ottawa about it. An earlier advance on this same job was accounted for in exactly the same manner and there appears to be no reason why any change should be made if it is acceptable to Ottawa.\n\nThe other three vouchers were necessary because the Department did not forward a further advance to cover balance of wages, as I requested.\n\nB/DH.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEncls.\n10th Apr., 1944.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq., Indian Agent, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI am returning herewith your Vouchers Nos. 567, 568, 569 and 570, covering labour at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and would request that they be amended, as follows:\n\nVoucher #567 - This Voucher should be omitted entirely as a statement of expenditures against the advance of $200.00 would be sufficient. If you wish to submit this statement on a voucher form, it would necessarily be a Credit Voucher and the items would have to be supported by receipts.\n\nVoucher #568 - should be combined with Voucher No. 567 and should be itemized, as follows:\n\n(Pay to H. J. Hoad)\nLabour, Sechelt School, October to December, as per paylist attached...$120.43\n\nLabour, Sechelt School, for week ending Feb. 19th, 1944...$26.24\n\" Feb. 26th, 1944...$43.34\n\" Mar. 4th, 1944...$43.34\n\" Mar. 11th, 1944...$45.24\n\" Mar. 18th, 1944...$45.24\n\" Mar. 25th, 1944...$45.24\n\" Mar. 31st, 1944...$45.24 293.88\nas per paylists attached $414.31\n\nPaid by Agency Cheque #28797, as per receipt attached...$120.43\nPaid by Agency Cheque #28655, as per receipt attached...$75.00 195.43 $215.88\n\nVoucher No. 569 would appear to be in order but is returned as the number may be altered.\n\n(over)\nVoucher No. 570 would not be approved in its present form. I would suggest that you purchase the stamps from your own pocket and try and obtain a receipt for same dated prior to April 1st.\n\nIt would have been preferable to submit Credit Vouchers covering the expenditures made from the $200.00 advanced and for the unexpended balance of $2.34 returned to the Department.\n\nD. M.

Ball, Indian Agent, 416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to the advance of $200 forwarded to you on December 21, 1943, to cover the cost of wages for repairs at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. On your voucher 567 you included the amount of $75 and stated that labour returns for the period were attached to voucher 568. When you forwarded voucher 568 no labour returns were attached to it for the $75, although you made a note on this voucher to see voucher 567. As a result it has been brought to our attention this morning by the Treasury Branch that there is still an amount of $75 for which you have not yet accounted. It would be appreciated if you would account for this amount immediately.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1944.\n\nMr. F.J.G. Ball, Indian Agent, 416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n12th instant, arrangements are being made to\nforward you an accountable cheque for $250 to\ncover wages for making repairs at the Sechelt\nResidential School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nre: File No.167-18-5\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant regarding the wages for repairs to Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe $75.00 shown on Voucher No.567 (which accounts for the advance of $200.00) was simply a payment on account of the total wages from February 14th to March 31st, and I intended to pay the balance of these wages as soon as I received another advance. However, this was not forthcoming, and so a voucher had to be made covering the unpaid balance of wages.\n\nAs none of the labour returns added up to exactly $75.00, they were all attached to Voucher No.568, and totalled $293.08. The payment of $75.00 on account was then shown, and this left a balance owing to Mr.Hoad of $218.88.\n\nThe only way in which the payment of $75.00 could be accounted for exactly on the labour returns, would be to divide them up. Those for the weeks ending Feb.19 and 26th total $69.58 and the return for week ending March 4th could be divided in two, the first part amounting to $5.42 (to make up the $75.00) and the latter part to $37.92. This would involve re-writing both vouchers....will you please advise if this should be done?\n\nDH.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: VANCOUVER INDIAN AGENCY TRUST ACCOUNT\n\nADDRESS:\n\n(CREDIT VOUCHER)\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n| PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT OF WAGES FROM FEBRUARY 14th/34 TO MARCH 31st...

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Conditions, Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nA few days ago the Principal of the marginally-noted school visited this office and while here discussed with me, at considerable length, certain administrative problems confronting him at the school.\n\nThe Principal spoke very highly of the Agent's interest in the school and the co-operation extended to him by the officials of the Department, generally. He was convinced, however, or at least appeared to be, that the amount of money placed at his disposal from year to year, for the construction of additional buildings, particularly a gymnasium, and to keep the main building in a proper state of repair, was in no sense adequate. In this connection I pointed out to him that the money at our disposal for the repair and purchase of equipment at Indian residential schools, since I entered the Department, had never been sufficient at any time to meet the demands for expenditures sent in by principals from year to year. I did assure him, however, that in reviewing our estimates, the same consideration was given to the Sechelt School and to its needs that was given to our other schools.\n\nThe Principal is of the opinion that a gymnasium at this school is a matter of extreme urgency. On wet days there is no place for the youngsters to pay, with the result that when kept indoors they are exceedingly difficult to manage. In addition to this, he informed me that very few vegetables, if any, were grown at the school. This\nnecessitates the shipment of vegetables, cattle feed and indeed all the supplies required from Vancouver, which fact adds substantially to the cost of operating the institution.\n\nI am particularly anxious that we should do everything humanly possible to keep our better schools, such as Sechelt, Kuper Island, Alberni, and others that might be mentioned, from deteriorating rapidly. I have already asked you to make a survey of conditions at Alberni, and I have been wondering if you or the agent could not undertake a somewhat similar survey at Sechelt. Mr. Phelan informs me that there is a large barn at Sechelt. It would be interesting to have a report from you on the necessity of this barn, if the school farm or school lands are incapable of producing the food necessary to maintain stock. Would it be possible to turn this barn, or a portion of it, into a playground for the male pupils? It will be appreciated, of course, that this is a suggestion made by one who is wholly unfamiliar with local conditions. The suggestion, therefore, may be wholly impracticable. I am deeply interested, however, in our school buildings, and I want to state quite frankly that unless we can secure more funds for the repair and upkeep of these buildings, it will be exceedingly difficult, in the period immediately ahead of us, to maintain them in a state of efficiency. It would be deeply appreciated, therefore, if we could have from you or from the agent a very frank expression of opinion on the condition of this school, its buildings and the general administrative setup.\n\nI may add that there is available for repairs at this school during the present fiscal year the sum of $600.\n\nR.

These estimates have been made by Mr. Hoad who did all the repair work of last year. Knowing the school as you do, and the nature of the work to be done I am sure you will agree that the following estimates tendered by him are exceptionally low.\n\nExterior paint & repairs etc. ------- $27.00\nInterior \" \" \" \" ------- $95.00\nTOTAL $1522.00\n\nIn order that the department might be better acquainted with the nature and cost of the work to be done, I am giving the following itemized account.\n\nExterior Repairs:\n1. Stain barn and roofs of root house and Manual Training shop ------------------------ $185.00\n2. Board in wood shed ------------------------------------- $95.00\n3. Stain walls of above ------------------------------------ $12.00\n4. Replace \u00bd in. wire screens on sixteen windows and repair frames --------------------- $40.00\n5. Repair plumbing in boys lavatory -- renew waste line from urinal - basins -- renew sheet iron walls of showers ---------------------------------- $40.00\n6. Repair and paint boys and girls fire escapes ------------ $80.00\n7. Renew walls and insulate refrigerator ------------------- $120.00\n8. Paint 16l windows plus outside woodwork --------------- $295.00\n\nInterior Repairs:\n1. Repair cement floor approaching boys lavatory ------- $25.00\n2. Replaces two flights of steps of main stairway on boys side ---------------------------- $57.00\n3. Repair kitchen ceiling and paint ---------------------- $80.00\n4. Repair walls and paint boys class room and stage room --------------------------------- $80.00\n5. Junior Girls dormitory and corridor - paint etc. -\nand Senior Girls class rooms \" ----------------------------- $75.00\n6. Girls wash room --------------------------------------- $90.00\n7. Paint & repair plaster - boys and girls lavatories ------------------------------- $24.00\n8. Repair walls and paint shoe room ---------------------- $52.00\n9. Paint disciplinarian's room ----------------------------- $28.00\n10. Paint main entrance hall, corridor & parlor ------------ $25.00\n11. Paint Staff dining room ------------------------------- $107.00\n12. Paint Staff dining room ------------------------------- $18.00\nTOTAL $1522.00\nI wish to make a strong appeal that the amount of monies asked for be granted. As has been brought to the attention of the department, this school through lack of a sufficiently large yearly grant for upkeep in the past, has fallen into a rather poor state of repair. Unless the full amount asked for be granted we are bound to fall behind once more in this very necessary work.\n\nIt is evident that a building this size requires constant attention, not only for the protection of the health and wellbeing of the children but for economy's sake as well. For example the repairs for the kitchen ($80.00) has been brought about by a leaking roof. Again we find several boards in the fire escape completely rotted due to lack of paint. It is patent that lumber exposed to Pacific Coast weather must be repainted at regular intervals.\n\nAs this is a government building -- a taxpayers investment, entrusted to the care of the Oblate Fathers I feel a very serious obligation to see that their investment be protected. It can only be protected by constant attention to repairs and with sufficient means to meet these repairs.\n\nI wish to express my gratitude for the great amount of work we were able to accomplish through the cooperation of your office in the past year.\n\nEnclosed please find two copies of estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nMr. F. J. C. Hall,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVancouver.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of an application from the Reverend Principal at Sechelt Residential School. We have done considerable renovating and repairing during the past year but what we have already done makes the other part look bad in comparison.\n\nThe Principal has listed the various items by numbers and in pencil, I have listed them in order of importance in my estimation. All the work is needed but I realise funds are limited. Whatever amount is allowed will be used to the best advantage and judging from work done in the past, am confident we shall receive full value. We have had exceptional service from Mr. Road in the past and several companies including the Union Steamships would like to have his services.\n\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of the 23rd instant with that of the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School of the 1st instant requesting authorization of an expenditure of $1,522.00 for repairs to the school as tabulated.\n\nIt is noted that $1,500.00 was provided for this work in the current estimates and if funds are available I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to a request for repairs at the Sechelt Residential School. In the current year's appropriation an amount of $1000 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. Since April 1 we have incurred the following expenditures:\n\n1. Advance of $250 made to Indian Agent Ball in May. I understand this amount was intended to cover the balance of the cost of wages for the repairs done during the earlier part of the year.\n\n2. Payment of voucher $3, forwarded through your office, covering the cost of varnish etc. - $56.89.\n\n3. Expenditure required for repairing fire escape, as per letter of July 31 - $50.\n\n4. Additional advance for labour made to Indian Agent Ball in August - $57.44.\n\nThe above totals $414.33. This leaves a balance of approximately $586 still available. I note that on the copy of the letter forwarded by Agent Ball he has marked items in order of importance. I, therefore, suggest that the following receive attention:\n1. Repair plumbing in boys' lavatory etc. ....$ 40\n2. Repair and paint fire escapes ............. 80\n3. Renew walls and insulate refrigerator ..... 180\n4. Replace wire screens on windows .......... 40\n5. Paint 161 windows .......................... 295\n6.

An extra $50.00 was allowed when the fire escape was found to be in a dangerous condition.\n\nThis money has been expended and considerable work done which we had no means of determining in advance. For instance, in painting the window frames, it was found that the window sills on the south side of the school were mere shells, all the wood having perished, and only the painted outside of the sills remained. With the slightest pressure, these sills crumbled and we had to replace them with cement sills. This meant extra expense, which could not be foreseen.\n\nIn repairing the fire escape, some massive looking pillars holding up the 2nd and 3rd floors were out of alignment and on examination the bases were found completely rotted. These also were repaired with concrete. A heavy load on either floor might have caused a collapse of what looked like a solid structure.\n\nThese are only a few items, but many others could be mentioned. Only where such conditions rendered them unsafe were repairs made.\n\nThe amount authorized has been slightly over-expended but we have had to omit repairing the refrigerator which was included in the original estimate. The walls of this plant have been holed by rats and the fumes from the plant escape into the refrigerator. The solution is to rebuild the refrigerator itself and have it placed in the main school building instead of in a shed by itself. The machinery can remain in the shed and the pipe brought underground to the new site - a distance of only a few feet. I have asked for an estimate of this work, which I hope will be allowed.\nThe over expenditure referred to amounts to approximately $75.00 and I trust that a further advance will be forwarded as it is required for wages. I have stopped all further work on the School pending your instructions.\n\nYou will have received a report from Mr. James Coleman, Inspector of Indian Agencies, who accompanied me to Sechelt to see the work which has been done there. For the small amount allowed, we have done major repairs and renovations at low cost only because we were fortunate in having a conscientious and practical workman in the person of Mr. Henry Hoad to do the work.\n\nThe following work is only part of what he has done:\n\n- New Floors laid in boys and girls play room and in sewing room.\n- Concrete floor laid in boys' lavatory and approaches. Several toilets repaired.\n- All passage ways, dormitories, class rooms, two sick rooms, dining rooms, laundry, etc., renovated.\n- All outside wood-work painted, including several dozen windows.\n- Window sills renewed and painted.\n- New fire escape built and old fire escapes repaired.\n\nUnder some circumstances, such work might cost several thousand dollars and several different tradesmen would be required to do it. I may add that Mr. Hoad did most of the work in designing and building the new Roman Catholic Church at Sechelt, and the Church authorities want him to build another Church at Gibson's Landing. He is non-Catholic and there is no question as to his ability and integrity, otherwise he would not be employed by them.\n\nWill you kindly convey these facts to the Department, and request a further advance of, say, $100.00 so that the balance of wages can be paid for the work done so far?\n\nIndian Agent\n\nB/DH.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of January 9th with reference to further expenditures required in connection with repairs to the Sechelt Indian Residential School. Mr. Ball was provided with a copy of Mr. Phelan's letter of August 31st in this connection on September 7th and on October 2nd a purchase order was issued from this office in the amount of $150.60 covering the supply of paint, hardware, etc., but I have no knowledge of the extra $50.00 mentioned by Mr. Ball for repairs to the fire escape. It would appear, however, that an additional $100.00 will be required to complete payment of wages for the work done to date and it is recommended that this amount be forwarded to Mr. Ball.\n\nD.M.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant,\nenclosing correspondence from Indian Agent Ball, in\nconnection with repairs at the Sechelt Residential\nSchool.\n\nAs you state, an expenditure of $600.00\nwas authorized in my letter of August 31. Since that\ntime, at the request of Mr. Ball, we have forwarded\nhim two cheques for labour - one cheque for $250.00 was\nsent the end of October and a further cheque for $150.00\nearly in December. These total $400.00 and, added to\nthe amount of your purchase order of $150.60, would\nmean a total expenditure of $550.60. Consequently, there\nwould be a balance of approximately $50.00 unexpended.\nPossibly this is the amount to which Mr. Ball referred.\nHowever, in view of your recommendation, we are forwarding\nanother cheque for $100.00 to Mr. Ball, and he should\nbe definitely informed that this is all that we can\nallow for repairs and improvements and the purchase of\nnew equipment at this school during the current fiscal\nyear.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM TO:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom the Inspector of Indian Agencies\n\nRe: Skehalt Indian Residential School\n\nIn accordance with your instructions pursuant to the Department's request of July 10th, 1944 (File 167-16-5) I proceeded to Skehalt Indian Residential School on September 19th, 1944, to Mr. Indian Agent Bell, returning the following day, to make a survey of conditions at the school and report on the necessity of a school gymnasium and farm operations. It is apparent that routine annual maintenance was not kept up and as a result deterioration of the school proceeded to the point where its restoration became imperative and costly. Some of this work has been overtaken during the past two years.\n\nGymnasium: As this is what apparently gave rise to the request for a report I will deal with it first. The reason given for building is that weather conditions necessitate keeping the children under cover most of the time. With this I do not entirely agree. Weather conditions are about the same as Alert Bay, North Vancouver, Mission and other Residential schools on the Coast. However, there is no doubt that a gymnasium is very desirable if funds can be provided.\n\nAn attempt was made to convert the hay mow of the school barn into a gymnasium without much success as it can never be entirely cleared of old hay dust and the gambrel roof trusses present a hazard. There is no access for light and the electric lights are inadequate. There appears to be very little equipment. About all that can be said of it is that it is better than nothing for this purpose but on the other hand, the school stock are still housed in the lower part of the barn and the hay mow is essential to their needs.\n\nA photograph of the barn is attached and also one of the combined manual training shop and laundry drying and ironing room, housed in a very old building that is practically falling apart. The laundry is on the ground floor. The stairway entrance to the manual training shop is shown on the photograph and as it was the only escape the laundry operations underneath created a dangerous fire risk. I advised the acting principal, Father Murray, in the absence of Father Dunlop, to install a ladder escape from one of the windows but the use of the building should be discontinued and it should be torn down to prevent its use for some other purpose equally hazardous to the children.\n\nApart from a gymnasium, the school needs an auditorium which is now provided for by the conversion of two of the class rooms for this purpose which, consequently, are not available for educational work. Projection of motion pictures has been arranged for by cutting a hole in one of the class room walls and setting up the projector in an adjoining room. A stage has also been set up in one of the class rooms, which open into each other by a large sliding or folding door.\nThe manual training shop, gymnasium and auditorium could all be combined under one roof. Basketball and badminton would be desirable exercises and the minimum floor space requirements would be 55' x 75' or 55' x 65' if a stage at one end were included. Probably in the interests of safety and speedy evacuation the ground floor would be preferable for the auditorium and the manual training and boat building shop located on the first floor, with a ramp for taking out large boats. Lumber and material could be stored in the attic. The cost would probably run to at least $17,500 depending on finish, labour arrangements, etc., if and when that amount of building material could be made available, as the priority would not be very high, although Indian Agent Hall advises that he can secure it. I would recommend provision of this building when funds are available and subject to prior needs at this school.\n\nI am not in favour of extensive farming operations at Indian Residential schools for the reason that sooner or later a Principal will be tempted to exploit the pool of child labour available in the institution. If the schools offered a definite course on agriculture to the pupils, the farms would be of great value, but from my observations the training is largely confined to hoeing, pitching hay and milking, etc., with no class room work or discussion of the principles of farming. I consider the problem in general is one that calls for careful investigation, review and direction by the Department.\n\nThe stock and implements at this date consist of:\n\n- 5 milk cows\n- 3 beef cattle\n- 2 sows\n- 1 boar\n- 1 horse (no harness)\n- 75 hens (estimated)\n- 1 disc harrow\n- 1 harrow\n- 1 plough\n- 1 cultivator\n- 1 wagon\n\nThe school site and grounds cover a lot of 4.4 acres, with 10.6 acres of partly cleared pasture at the back of the school, all being within the boundaries of Seehelt Indian Reserve No. 1. It is reported that the school was given the use of the 10.6 parcel by the Band on February 17, 1915.\n\nThe barn is in need of some minor repairs and repainting at a probable cost of about $200.00.\n\nThe poultry house shown on the photograph attached is a most ramshackle structure that should be torn down and replaced. Actually it is just outside the easterly boundary of the 4.4 acre lot, on a small lot apparently set aside by the Band for the missionary's residence, which it is stated was built in 1925 by the Band or the Department. As poultry keeping should be a training project, the old chicken house should be torn down as it is a disgrace, and a new standard type of house built on school property, complete with deep nests etc., for which the cost of material would probably amount to about $200. The construction should be carried out by the pupils, under supervision, as a project.\nThe school, or Oblate Fathers, are reported as owning or leasing a fair sized farm, formerly Japanese property, near the school, but no details could be secured. I am informed animals are not employed on it. Apart from this, I don't think the 10.6 acres could support more than two cows and then only with intensive cultivation. Probably two or three milk cows, a single horse, two sows and about one hundred hens will give the children all the training possibilities they require (they will not engage in farming after graduation) and provide the school with at least part of its milk and egg requirements. With this in view the barn would be necessary to the school farm.\n\nAn effort should be made to establish a school garden of at least an acre in order to train the children not only in cultural processes but in nutritional standards. With this in view a soil survey and soil improvement study should be made of any proposed garden site. The soils here are mostly lacking in nitrogen due to this essential requirement to growth being leached out by heavy rainfalls.\n\nI will review briefly the condition of the buildings other than those already mentioned.\n\nMain Building\n\nWindows\n\nThese have either developed a shrinkage in width of about 5/8\" or were badly fitted. Due to lack of maintenance painting the sash in many of them has rotted. There are 130 - 145 windows, all exposed to gales off the sea. The result is that the rooms facing the wind become practically untenantable and fuel costs are increased enormously. The remedy is overhauling and where possible refitting by splicing a strip on one edge of the sash as per sketch:\n\nThis could possibly be carried out on the manual training power tools by the carpenter usually employed by the school at somewhat less than anticipated by the Reverend Principal. The window panes should be properly caulked between the panes and brick work. The Principal's estimate is $650.00. Fuel savings will possibly pay for this work in two or three years.\n\nFloors\n\nThe basement floors have been treated with some bituminous substance and are not very satisfactory. Some rooms have been covered with fir flooring. I consider one of the mastic floor coverings would have been preferable, especially in the kitchen where it is proposed to use ordinary fir flooring. I cannot estimate the cost at present but would suggest that it would not be less than $1000.00.\n\nKitchen Ceiling\n\nRoof leaks need locating and repair and walls, which are glazed brick, repair and joints repainted. Probable cost, $100.00.\nCupboards\nRequire to be provided or repaired in kitchen, storeroom and sewing room. Estimated cost $500.00 by Principal.\n\nPlumbing\nA very poor job was made in roughing this in when the building was erected. The Principal would like to see it replaced by copper piping at a cost of $1000.00. It will probably come down to sundry repairs at a cost of $250.00.\n\nPlaster\nBroken plaster creates a fire hazard apart from the question of appearance. Repairs to the extent of about $100.00 required.\n\nInterior Decoration\nSome good work has been done in the past two years but there still remains the greater part to be done, which the Principal estimates will cost about $700.00.\n\nStair Treads\nOn the main stairways they are worn down to the risers. Repair costs will probably amount to $75.00.\n\nFire Escapes and Hardware\nTwo panic bolts are required for fire doors. Many door locks and knobs require repair and replacement. Estimated cost $100.00.\n\nThe wood verandah posts on fire escapes at each end of the building were rotten at the ends and collapsing. It is imperative that these be replaced as soon as possible. Will probably cost $200.00.\n\nHeating\nThe plant requires investigating as it fails to heat the junior boys' dormitory and the senior boys' class rooms. Quite possibly repairs to windows and caulking will remedy the defect.\n\nWindow Shades\nAre required for most of the windows and will cost about $45.00.\n\nFurniture and Woodwork\nPainting and revarnishing woodwork, beds and desks should be undertaken when possible at an estimated cost of $500.00.\n\nExterior\nThe brick used in construction of this building was rough and over-burnt, but well laid. The brick walls were not cleaned off on completion of construction.\n\nThere is evidence of leakage in the front wall on the left wing and requires some attention. It is difficult to estimate, but if condition is not extensive it would probably amount to about $200.00. The rain storms drive in from the sea and eventually work through weak spots in the masonry.\nExterior (Cont'd)\n\nThere is need for repainting of wood and metal work and this with other items likely to arise on closer investigation will probably run the cost up to at least $5,000.00, including replacement of eavestroughs which are badly corroded.\n\nSchool Grounds\n\nThere is considerable room for improvement in the upkeep of the lawns and flower beds in the front of the school. No cost should be estimated for this.\n\nRefrigeration\n\nThe plant is housed in an outbuilding at the rear of the school. The cooler walls are in need of reconstruction and exhaust filling replaced by more efficient insulator.\n\nAt the time of my visit the door of the building was open and there was no protection against injury to the children, the engine and compressor being without guards. I discussed this with Father Baxter and asked him to see that it was properly guarded. Cost of Reconstruction, etc., will probably amount to $150.00.\n\nBarn\n\nConstruction commenced but not completed. Estimated cost to finish by boarding and painting is $95.00.\n\nDairy\n\nAt present a room in the school is used for this, but would be more desirable to have a separate building at a cost of $250.00.\n\nSlaughter House\n\nSlaughtering was being done in the barn, which is not good practice. If enough to warrant a building it should be installed. Estimated cost for material, $100.00.\n\nFloor Coverings\n\nThe Assistant Principal suggested transferring unused linoleum from Alberni Residential School for use in this school.\n\nLand Clearing\n\nThere still remains some land clearing to be done on the ten acre block, at an estimated cost of $600.00, if and when funds ever become available.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe trouble here is very similar to conditions at Cranbrook Residential School, a residential school and staff with a day school attendance. The quota is eighty, but only sixty-nine were attending at the time of my visit. The cost of maintenance is not proportionate to the pupilage when we compare it with the three hundred pupilage of Kamloops Residential School and the result is that these small schools cannot divert funds to proper maintenance and in consequence it costs more in the long run than if this was attended to every year.\nThe staff consisted of:\n\nFather Dunlop - Principal\nFather Baxter - Assistant Principal\nBrother MacLeod\nSister Superior Anna Maria\nSister Angi - senior class teacher\nSister Josephine - junior class teacher\nSister Joseph Henry - children's cook\nSister Raphaela - staff cook\nSister Helen - sewing and laundry\nFarm hand and engineer.\n\nIt is very probable that with the advent of \"Children's Allowances\" this, and other Residential schools, will have a great deal of trouble maintaining their quota of pupils and it might be advisable to note the trend at Bechet before expanding any very large amounts on repairs. A twenty percent decrease in school population would probably make it impossible to finance.\n\nThe children appeared to be receiving excellent physical care. I made no attempt to assess the academic work of the school.\n\nI would recapitulate the cost of repairs, etc., as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Gymnasium             | $7,500.00 |\n| Windows               | $500.00 |\n| Floors                | $1,000.00 |\n| Kitchen               | $100.00 |\n| Cupboards             | $50.00 |\n| Exterior              | $2,000.00 |\n| Plumbing              | $250.00 |\n| Chicken house         | $200.00 |\n| Dairy                 | $200.00 |\n| Barn                  | $200.00 |\n| Interior decoration   | $700.00 |\n| Plaster               | $100.00 |\n| Stair treads          | $75.00 |\n| Varnish & paint furniture | $350.00 |\n| Hardware              | $100.00 |\n| Window shades         | $45.00 |\n| Woodshed              | $95.00 |\n| Land clearing         | $600.00 |\n| Fire escape           | $200.00 |\n| Slaughter house       | $100.00 |\n| Refrigerator          | $150.00 |\n\n$ 15,315.00\n\nJ. Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 167-18-5\n\nI have to refer to your letter of July 10, 1944, regarding the Sechelt Indian Residential School. Following receipt of your letter arrangements were made for Inspector Coleman to inspect the school buildings and look into the question of the provision of a gymnasium. A copy of Inspector Coleman's memorandum dealing with these matters is attached.\n\nIt is true that with but a few exceptions our Residential School buildings have not been maintained in a proper state of repair. This is particularly evident with respect to the Kootenay, St. George's and Sechelt Schools on which substantial outlays will have to be made to meet existing needs. In preparing the list of worthwhile works that might be undertaken in this Province immediately following the close of the war, this matter was kept in mind and an amount of $7,500.00 included for each of these schools. No provision, however, was made therein for a gymnasium. It is only recently that this question has arisen. Father Dunlop's predecessors and those who have inspected the school in the past ten years either overlooked the matter or were satisfied that the existing facilities for sports and amusements were sufficient for the time being.\n\nThe barn at the school is needed for stock and the storage of grain and hay, and is, therefore, not available for conversion into a gymnasium. In any case, it is highly doubtful if it could be made suitable for such purpose without a large expenditure which could be used to better advantage towards the cost of an entirely new structure.\nI am satisfied that the most pressing need is to carry out the necessary repairs and improvements to the main building and funds should first be provided for this purpose. I agree that a gymnasium is desirable and would recommend that an item providing for a suitable building be included in the post war programme of new construction. Accommodation for a gymnasium, manual training shop and also a laundry if the present accommodation isn't suitable might be provided in one building. The ground floor could be used for a gymnasium and auditorium and the basement for the manual training division and a laundry or other service. A building of the dimensions suggested by Mr. Coleman would at present costs of labour and material cost much more than his estimate of $7,500.00. I should say that $15,000.00 would be much nearer the amount required.\n\nThe construction of a suitable poultry house, also a dairy building and a slaughterhouse could be undertaken as manual training projects and should be proceeded with as soon as funds can be secured.\n\nThe administration of the school by Reverend Father Dunlop is reported to be satisfactory.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, February 14, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, reporting on the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Hoey your recommendations regarding future improvements at this school, and in our post-war program we are including an amount to cover the expenditure that would be necessary. However, our proposed expenditures on post-war work have not yet been definitely decided.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Sechelt Residential School\n\nI have received the enclosed letter from the Rev. Principal of the above school.\n\nSince Father Dunlop took over the principalship here he has rented a former Japanese dairy farm and has supplied the school with beef and pork from stock kept on this farm. He also keeps several milk cows and the pupils all receive milk with their meals.\n\nThey have hitherto done the slaughtering in the barn which was unsanitary and unsatisfactory in every way. Recently they were compelled by health authorities to erect a proper slaughterhouse. This will cost about $125.00 as it has to have a concrete floor and proper drainage, and the Principal asks that we pay something towards the cost. The amount of $50.00 would supply the lumber while the cement and other material and the labour would be paid from their grant.\n\nWill you please advise if this request can be entertained.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent\n\nFB/C Enc.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nJan 30, 1945\n\nMr. F.

We have begun work on the construction on a building suitable for slaughtering. Would you kindly place before the department a request for $50.00 to assist in erection of same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nF. P.

It is considered that these expenditures will be a legitimate charge against the B.C. Special Vote as the buildings will be used in providing instruction to the pupils in the care and housing of poultry.\n\nThere are at the present time outstanding accounts totaling approximately $80.00 which should be charged to the technical education division of the B.C. Special Vote, but it is doubtful if accounts will be received in time for payment from 1944-45 fiscal year funds as in most cases the material and equipment is unavailable.\n\nFor D.M.

To hardware and paint supplied Sechelt Indian Residential School, as per accounts attached | 97.20 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada. This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 1785, July 30/45.\n\nFORM No. I.A.508\n\nVoucher No. 191\n\nDATE August 29, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to report that the refrigeration at Sechelt Indian Residential School has broken down completely and needs renewal. It is an old ammonia system, I believe it was put in the original school over 25 years ago. The pressure caused an explosion and they were fortunate that there was no fatality as the man who handled it was standing over the plant when it happened. This break was welded but immediately broke again in several places. There has been leakage from half a dozen places in the plant and the operator resigned as the ammonia fumes could not be controlled.\n\nWhen the break-down occurred, the school had just killed and they lost half a beef before it could be taken care of. I visited the school on Monday, the 10th instant, and made temporary arrangements with the Union S.S. Store to give us refrigerator storage until Sept. 30th. The Union S.S. hotel closes for the month of October and they will let us use their refrigerator until October 30, although it is rather small for school purposes.\n\nOn the 11th a man was sent from Vancouver to look over the system to see what could be done. He sent the engine to Vancouver and they advise me this morning that there is absolutely no hope of repairing it and similar engines are not to be found now, as it is so much out of date.\n\nI have contacted some local firms and the General Refrigeration Engineering Co., Ltd., of 83 Alexander St., Vancouver a subsidiary of Fleck Bros., Ltd., which supplies logging outfits, etc. appear to be the best available source, but they cannot guarantee delivery until mid-October at the earliest. Other firms are in even worse position.\n\nThe refrigerator box is in bad shape and should be renewed and placed in another situation altogether. It is at present in an old building which used to be the boys' dormitory in the original school, and is too exposed.\n\n(over)\nThe figures I have obtained are as follows:\n\nFor a fully automatic water cooled 1 H.P. engine, completely installed with coils, etc. ........... $875.00\n\nA new door for the refrigerator $75.00\n\nBuilding a new refrigerator $250.00\n\nThis makes a total of $1200.00. The present system has a 2 HP engine in good condition and also fairly new coils which could be credited against this cost. A water-cooled 1 HP motor would be more economical and more satisfactory and the automatic system would save much labour time.\n\nThis company installed the Union S.S. store and hotel refrigerators and for that reason would be a convenience as they make regular inspections of both plants there, saving expense of bringing a man from Vancouver for inspection, etc.\n\nThe new refrigerator box costs $375.00 complete, in Vancouver, but we could save $75.00 on this by having the carpenter at Sechelt build it there, the only part which should be bought is the door.\n\nThis matter is an emergency as the food situation at the school is critical and after October 30th I do not know where we can find storage.\n\nPresumably this is a problem for the Reverend Principal to solve, but he is completely at a loss as to what should be done.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 19th September, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Indian Agent Ball with reference to the refrigeration system at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nAs I presume this matter was not previously referred to you I would like to have your comments and recommendations before submitting the matter to the Minister's Office.\n\nThe expenditure suggested by Mr. Ball appears high but possibly it may be necessary to incur the expenditure mentioned in his communication.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File: 167-18-5\n\nPending submission to the Minister's office of the matter of replacement of the refrigeration unit at Sechelt Indian Residential School at an estimated cost of $1200, possibly the Department could ascertain if the Department of National Defence have one surplus to requirements with the current closing of R.C.A.F. and Army camps in this and adjoining Provinces.

It will be necessary to extend the vault somehow and also to change the doors.\n\nRev. H.F. Dunlop has asked for Mr. Hoad to be instructed to do this work. I cannot say what the cost will be, but if Mr. Hoad does the work, I can assure you that it will be done at the lowest possible price.\n\nThe work must be done immediately, as the School has the use of the hotel refrigerator only while the hotel is closed, but as it re-opens on November 1st, they will have no refrigerator after that date.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nB/DH.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI would refer to your telegram of the 17th instant approving of the purchase of a refrigerator from the War Assets Corporation for the Sechelt Indian Residential School, at a cost of $400.00, and would advise that this has now been transferred to the school.\n\nIn this connection I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of the 26th instant advising that in order to make the best possible use of the refrigerator it will be necessary to have it installed by the construction man, Mr. Hoad, who has been doing most of the work of this nature around the school and is considered by Agent Ball to be very competent. The installation will necessitate some minor alterations to doors, etc., of the school and some expense in enlarging the refrigerator itself which, Agent Ball informed me verbally, should not cost more than $200.00, but could give no exact details.\n\nAs the Union Estates will be taking over, on the 1st proximo, the refrigerator which the school is using temporarily, I would recommend that approval be given by airmail if possible, particularly as the total cost of the unit and installation will only amount to half of the amount estimated in Agent Ball's letter of the 13th ultimo. It is considered that the alterations to the building will not in any way affect its structural stability.\n\nD. M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour letter of the 29th ultimo reached me this morning. Approval is granted for an expenditure of $200.00 in order to install the new refrigerator in the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nThe enclosed account has been referred to me for payment, and I am writing to enquire whether the Department or the School should pay it.\n\nThe expense was incurred in September when the refrigerator system at Sechelt Indian Residential School exploded, fortunately without serious injury to anyone, although the janitor suffered somewhat from ammonia fumes. As these fumes were escaping, the Principal telephoned for assistance, and a man was sent up from Vancouver by the first boat to see what could be done about repairs. Upon his return he reported that the engine was worthless and beyond repair, and since that time a refrigerator has been obtained from the War Assets Corporation. The account enclosed is for the services of this man in dismantling the old system and stopping further leakage of ammonia, travelling expenses and time. It was incurred as a matter of extreme urgency and could not be avoided without endangering the health of the pupils and staff.\n\nWill you please advise whether the account should be paid by the School or forwarded to you? The Reverend Principal considers that it should not be a charge against the school grant and I have no authority for the expense.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nB/DH.\nEncls.\nOttawa, November 7, 1945.\n\nMr. F.J.C.

J. C. Ball,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nWood has been used exclusively in this school both for heating and cooking since its erection. This wood has been obtained from the reserve lands. All the accessible wood has been cut down and it has become increasingly difficult and increasingly expensive to swamp out the year's fuel. Roads have to be made over rough terrain, equipment is continually breaking, and finally a horse has to be kept the year round for the hauling. In the beginning the wood was near the school and accessible, now it is distant from the school and hard to get at. It would lighten the expenses of the school and relieve us of a great deal of trouble and worry if coal were to be used. Evidently an automatic stoker is necessary if coal heating is to be economical.\n\nAn automatic stoker can be had from St. Augustine's Church in Vancouver for $200. This stoker cost $650.00 three years ago when wartime emergency required that institution to change from oil to coal heating. It is an excellent buy. Would the department consider purchasing it for the school?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Commissioner, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School with regard to changing from wood to coal for heating the school.\n\nThe facts are as stated by him in his letter; suitable wood is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. The automatic stoker referred to is no doubt a bargain but whether the Department has funds available, I do not know. The letter is sent for your consideration.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nB/DH.\nIndian Commissioner, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nre: File No. 215-14-2769\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th instant, I have gone carefully into the matter of changing the fuel at Sechelt Residential School from wood to coal.\n\nThe Reverend Principal gave several reasons for the change, viz., the increasing difficulty of obtaining suitable wood; the necessity of keeping a horse 12 months when it is used only 3 months of the year for hauling wood; the making of roads to new timber, etc., but in my opinion the strongest argument is that timber is being burned which is much more valuable for lumber. This should be conserved wherever it grows and of course the tendency is to cut it where it is more easily available.\n\nWe have an offer of an automatic stoker in perfect condition for $200.00. Coal could be sent up by scow and taken to the school by their truck. The steady heat of coal would be considerably better than wood, and I believe it would be a big saving of expense to the school.\n\nB/DH.\n\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letters of November 5th and 21st and enclosure referred to therein, in connection with the proposed use of coal for heating the Sechelt Indian Residential School and the purchase of an automatic stoker.\n\nThe information supplied by the Agent would indicate that the use of coal is desirable and I would recommend that, if funds are available, authority be granted for the purchase of the automatic stoker referred to at a cost of $200.00 from the St. Augustine's Church. It will be noted from Mr. Ball's letter of November 21st that the automatic stoker is said to be in perfect condition.\n\nD. M.

Ball,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVancouver,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nESTIMATES 1946-7.\n\n1- GYMNASIUM: In submitting these estimates for 1946, I should like to bring to the attention of the department once more our dire need for a gymnasium in connection with the school. The long rainy periods of Coastal B.C. makes such an undertaking essential. For example, the past three days of the Christmas holidays have been days of continuous rain. Picture if you will, a large group of children cooped up in small play rooms for such a length of time with little or no outlet for their pent-up energies. A gymnasium, as all the inspectors who have been here in my time have recommended is not a luxury but an absolute necessity. Approximate cost ---------------- $12,000.00\n\n2- WINDOWS: As pointed out last year the windows throughout the school are ill-fitting. This occasions a great deal of draughts and loss of heat. We have done what we could to tighten them up this year, but they need to be refitted and caulked. Cost ------------ $ 650.00\n\n3- KITCHEN: The ceiling of the kitchen has been destroyed by a leaking roof. The masonry needs to be fixed ----- $ 90.00\n\n4- CUPBOARDS: We need cupboards in the kitchen, the store room and the sewing room. The lack of same makes work difficult and gives the place an untidy appearance -- $ 600.00\n\n5- EXTERIOR OF BLDG: The roof needs staining, the rain pipes are rusted away, allowing the water to seep under the foundation of the building, the outside walls need weather proofing as the moisture has been penetrating the walls on the weather side and has destroyed a good deal of the interior decorating we did a year ago. Cost ----------------------------- $ 2000.00\n\n6- PLUMBING: The plumbing is more than twenty years old, as little has ever been done to it in the past it is in very bad shape. We are having continual trouble with it. The plumber is of the opinion that anything other than a complete renewal of all supply lines and fixtures would be a waste of time and money ------- $ 1000.00\n\n7- BARN REPAIRS: The barn is in a very bad state of repair. This is understandable as nothing has been done on it for years. As pointed out in last years estimates this building, which is relatively a new building should be attended to right away, otherwise permanent damage will be done to it. Staining and repairs to shingles ---- $ 190.00\n\n(Over) $16,530.00\nCarried forward ------ $16,530.00\n\n8- INTERIOR DECORATING: To complete the interior decorating, i.e., painting, varnishing wood which is very badly in need of same, repairing plaster and stairs on boy's side, varnishing desks and beds the following amount is needed ------------ $ 1,150.00\n\n9- HARDWARE: The hardware throughout the building, as locks and door knobs and panic locks need replacing. ---------------------------------------- $ 100.00\n\n10- DAIRY: At present we are using a room in the school proper which is next to the kitchen.

School, B.C.\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nReverend Father Dunlop of the above school, has had during the last twelve months, a larger number of pupils than he is authorized to accept and it is desired that the pupilage be increased by 20. This latter number will take care of at least part of those children who are now clamoring to be admitted.\n\nThis school, as well as all the B.C. schools, due to war conditions, has been neglected in the matter of general repairs and I suggest that the sum of $2,000.00 be placed to its credit in the coming estimates, for such purpose and that the principal be so advised through the Commissioner, so that he may plan for next summer vacation, for such work as he will deem most necessary for the good upkeep of his school.\n\nThe school library should receive some attention as it is very small and does not contain a sufficient variety of books to interest the children and to develop in them a taste for reading.\n\nAll B.C. schools situated on Vancouver Island and the Western shore of the province, have very wet climate and the recreation facilities provided in the basement of the schools are certainly not sufficient. The Sechelt School should have an outside gymnasium where the children, both boys and girls, could take their recreation on wet days and receive such physical training as is so essential for the\n\nover.....\nhealth of boarding school children. I do not know how much such a building would cost but a frame structure would be sufficient for the purpose and I think that the sum of $5,000.00 would be enough to erect it.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 13 September 1946.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Father Plourde:-\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nWe have noted your recommendation that $2,000 be included in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 and we will also reconsider the suggestion for providing an outside gymnasium.\n\nFor your information, we may say that in the current year's appropriation, we have provided an amount of $750.00 for repairs and improvements to this school but we have not received any request from the Principal in regard to any requirements he may have.\n\nIf there are any urgent repairs required, Father Dunlop should communicate with his Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ult., regarding the request of Sechelt Indian Residential School for assistance in purchasing a new sound projector, I beg to advise that the matter was again taken up with the Reverend Principal who advises as follows:\n\n1. The School already has a film strip machine for visual education purposes.\n2. The sound projector now in use and the new one required are only 16 mm. and the Reverend Principal and others on the staff are competent to operate this type of machine.\n3. Repairs are not expensive and the cost of such is borne by the School.\n4. Film rentals are paid for by the school.\n5. The film used is non-inflammable and no fire hazard is involved.\n6. A film strip machine cannot replace the much needed entertainment value of a sound projector for a school so isolated as is Sechelt, where there is nothing to relieve the monotony. Climatic conditions allow for no variety in summer and winter sports, and there are no picture shows in the vicinity. The children have been given a show every two weeks and the films shown are selected for both educational and entertainment value.\n\nIf a grant of $150.00 could be obtained from the Branch, the School will provide the remainder needed after a trade-in has been arranged.\n\n(H. E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 167-19-5 (W T)\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Neary's letter of September 19th in connection with the question of visual education, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of October 10th outlining his views and those of the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School with respect to this matter. It is my intention to discuss this subject with the new School Inspector, when appointed, with a view to securing his opinions and recommendation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 167-18-5 (W T)\n\nI have your letter of October 21st advising that arrangements have been made for the purchase of a 35 mm. film strip projecting machine for use at the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my letter of October 16th and Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of October 10th enclosed therewith wherein he advised that the school already has such a machine for visual education purposes. Mr. Taylor has today confirmed that the machine they have is suitable for their requirements. I would therefore suggest that if it is not too late the order referred to in your letter be cancelled.\n\nD. M.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nD. M. Mackay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nWith reference to Agency Estimates 1946-47 and to provision therein for buildings and repairs for Sechelt Indian Residential School, I would ask to be advised if funds are available to provide for any of the following, listed in order of preference:\n\n1. Repairs to kitchen ceiling, badly damaged by leaking roof. $90.00.\n2. Shingle repairs and staining for roof of barn. $190.00.\n3. New roof, foundation and walls for woodshed, now used for coal storage. $250.00.\n4. Replacing derelict fencing around School grounds. $650.00.\n5. Re-fitting and caulking of all window frames to prevent present draughts and loss of heat. $650.00.\n6. Renewal of plumbing supply lines and fixtures, over 20 years old. $1000.00.\n\nThe sum of $12,000.00 was also inserted to provide a new gymnasium, which has long been recommended by school inspectors and other officials as a definite necessity. Unless the total amount required is available at one time, I would not recommend that any portion of the funds available for any of the above listed purposes be diverted towards the cost of the gymnasium.\n\n(Over) --\nDetailed requisitions will be forwarded for any of the above, following advice that they are authorised.\n\n(H.

The majority of sports are held out of doors with the exception of a limited amount of basketball which is played in a very unsuitable gymnasium located in the top half of the school barn. It is not possible to play games in this auditorium and at the same time have the pupils watch the progress of the game.\n\nIn order to occupy the time of the pupils it is necessary to provide them with equipment which may be used outside. The school has laid out a badminton court in the grounds and has space which can be used for lacrosse if they are supplied with the necessary equipment. It would seem that the amount of time that the pupils could devote to badminton on an outside court with the amount of wind that prevails at Sechelt would be very limited and if the Department considers that the requisition should be reduced it is recommended that the badminton supplies be deleted from the list.\n\nRegarding the request for lacrosse sticks, these are more practical than the badminton equipment as the wind will not affect the playing of this game as it would in the case of badminton and it is believed that this sport would assist greatly in providing recreational activities which are needed at this school.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 167-18-5 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 2nd I am returning herewith Vancouver Agency requisition dated April 15th covering the supply of sports equipment for the Sechelt School. I may say that this requisition was discussed with School Inspector Davey prior to its submission to the Department and he was in agreement with my recommendation for the supply of the items asked for.\n\nInspector Davey recently visited the Sechelt School, however, and looked into the matter further, his memorandum dated May 17th being attached hereto for your information. I concur in his recommendation that the items requested be provided and that if the Department considers any reduction necessary the badminton supplies be deleted.\n\nD. M.

M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver.\n\nReference yours of June 10th, regarding funds allotted in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements to the Sechelt Indian Residential School, I note that the sum of $1103.65 is available after deducting $396.35 ear-marked for plumbing, and boiler repairs. Authority is requested to expend this balance as follows:\n\n1. Labour and material for cupboards in kitchen, store-room, scullery and sewing room. Contract price of Mr. H. Hoard $875.00. There is a great scarcity of cupboard space which seriously affects the efficient operating of the school's internal economy. In the sewing room, articles are piled upon open shelves, and there are no facilities in the kitchen, scullery, and store room, for storage of food supplies.\n\n2. Electric food chopper - $225.00. This will eliminate much repetitive labour and will aid sanitary preparation of food. Where 300 meals are served daily, a machine is necessary, taking some of the drudgery out of kitchen work, and rendering it more attractive to the girl pupils assigned to such work. There is no housekeeping education in daily manual recurring tasks in kitchen work, and efficient administration is greatly enhanced with power equipment.\n\n(H. E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 167-18-5 (WT1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of June 2nd advising that $1,500 have been provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, it is noted that $96.35 has already been spent for re-tubing boiler No. 44069 and an amount of $300 has been authorized for plumbing at the school, which will reduce the amount available to approximately $1,100.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Taylor, reference his letter of June 24th, has now requested authority for an expenditure of $875.00 for labour and material for the construction of cupboards, and $225 for the purchase of an electric food chopper which, if approved, will exhaust the funds provided. In addition to these expenditures application has been made for authority to purchase fire hose and fire reel at a cost of $450, reference Mr. Neary's letter of June 23rd. I understand from Mr. Taylor that the Rev. Principal would prefer that if the cost of the firehose and reel can only be met from the amount appropriated for the school the matter be dropped this year and priority given to the construction of cupboards and the purchase of an electric food chopper. I am unable to agree with the Rev. Principal in this respect as it seems that fire protection should receive first priority. It has occurred to me, however, that approval may not be given to the purchase of the food chopper as I understand it is against the policy of the Department to provide such equipment in which case the cost could be applied toward the purchase of a fire hose and possibly the Department may be able to make up the difference. I would therefore recommend that:\n\n(1) An expenditure of $875.00 be approved for the construction of cupboards.\nThat arrangements be made to purchase the fire hose and reel. In this connection I am enclosing quotations received from Gordon Belyea Ltd., covering the supply of fire hose reel at a cost of $125.32; Marshall-Wellis B.C. Ltd., covering the supply of fire hose at a cost of $168.20; and McLennan, McFelly and Prior Ltd., covering the supply of ten fire extinguishers, 5-gallon, hand pump style, at a cost of $139.50.\n\nI am prepared to ask the Rev. Principal to provide a sample hose coupling but it is thought that the following information with respect to the couplings should enable the wholesalers to identify the type:\n\n(a) The couplings for 1\u00bd\" hose are 1\u00bd\" standard pipe thread.\n\n(b) The couplings for the 2\u00bd\" hose have an outside diameter of 2 15/16\" with eight threads to the inch.\n\nI should like to suggest that the supply of an electric food chopper be given favourable consideration once funds can be provided for the purpose.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, July 5th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th ultimo\nwith reference to the Sechelt Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nThe following expenditures are approved:\n\n$875.00 for labour and materials for the con-\nstruction of new cupboards.\n\n$125.32 to purchase fire hose reel.\n\n$168.20 to purchase fire hose.\n\n$139.50 to purchase fire extinguishers.\n\nIt has not been our practice to supply\nequipment such as an electric food chopper. In any\ncase, the expenditure already authorized at this\nschool will exceed the amount specifically provided\nin the current year's appropriation.\n\nBernard F.

Taylor,\n416 Federal Building,\nVANCOUVER.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor: Re. Fire Escape - workshop.\n\nUpon recommendation by Mr. Coleman in September 1944 a ladder was placed by the window at the rear of the manual training shop. Later a storage for the oil drums was built by the side of the garage. As the garage roof is only a couple of feet below the rear window of the manual training shop, the construction of storage for the oil drums made a fairly easy means of escape from the manual training shop proper. Because this new means of escape seemed adequate to us and because one of the young men from the village was discovered in the act of entering the shop during the summer holidays obviously for reasons of theft, the ladder was taken down.\n\nHowever, upon receipt of your letter, June 25th, a landing has been built beneath one of the windows with an easy means of descent from same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"H. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\"\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nJuly 7th 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nCommissioner for Indian Affairs,\nVancouver, B.

If the original investment is to be protected, the Department must be prepared to make a substantial outlay without delay.

E. Taylor,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nNow that building materials and labour are again available, may I suggest that you bring to the attention of the Department the following very necessary undertakings in connection with the school:\n\nOur first and greatest need is a gymnasium for the school. That a gymnasium should be placed at the top of the list should not be surprising to one familiar with the weather conditions of coastal B. C., and far less surprising to one familiar with the construction of this school. The architect who constructed this building was either unaware of the need young bodies have for exercise, or, was labouring under the delusion that all future pupils would be invalids. The result was that two very small and poorly ventilated rooms were set aside for recreational purposes. No games involving running can be undertaken in these small rooms. We must therefore depend entirely on outdoor sports for healthful recreation.\n\nThe rainfall in Vancouver district averages 50\" per annum. Practically this whole amount falls between the month of November and the month of April. Sometimes there are long periods when it is impossible to undertake games outdoors. Picture, then, a group of active boys and girls penned up in small recreation rooms for days on end. The moral and physical effect on the children need no description.\n\nWere we able to indulge in winter sports like APR 17th 1948 and skiing, our need of a gymnasium would not be\nso imperative. Here we are committed entirely to field games, weather permitting.\n\nThe gymnasium, were it built, should contain in the basement a Manual Training shop, a drying room and a machine shop. At present the above is housed in what was left of the old school. The building is a fire hazard, is virtually beyond repair and should be demolished.\n\nI have no figures on the cost of a building approximately seventy-five feet by fifty and containing the above. It probably would be well in excess of $14,000.\n\nRepairs to the school on a large scale should be undertaken immediately. The present building has been standing for twenty-five years. For years no money whatsoever was granted for repairs. Of late years, the average has been under $1,000. Last year when $1,500 was granted, we congratulated ourselves that at least things were moving in the right direction. A few weeks later, $400 was deducted for fire equipment! The result has been that with such paltry amounts we have been unable to make any repairs of a substantial nature and have been obliged to content ourselves with building cupboards, doing a little decorating while the building itself continues to deteriorate.\n\nFor example, the brick on the weather side of the school should have been waterproofed years ago. Because money was not granted for this purpose it is impossible for me to estimate the extent of the damage done. We know what damage has been done on the surface in the way of rotted baseboard, destroyed plaster and decoration. Just what has taken place underneath I do not know. This seepage of water through the brick has been greatly facilitated by the fact that drain pipes are completely rotted away and have been for years. For renewal of drain pipes and waterproofing of walls a grant, certainly, of $4,000 would be necessary.\n\nThe plumbing throughout the entire building needs replacing. It has been installed for twenty-five years and because our water supply is not filtered it is almost completely blocked. There is little or no pressure on the third\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School and I concur fully in his observations regarding the inadequacy of funds provided annually to maintain this government-owned building in repair.\n\nThe continual deterioration will eventually result in a major expenditure being necessary.\n\nA reasonable percentage of the estimated value of the building must be made available annually if the pupils are to be maintained in a condition in accordance with health and welfare requirements.\n\nI sense great discouragement and a feeling of frustration on the part of the Principal and staff in having to carry on their most estimable work under such adverse conditions.\n\nThe school is very efficiently operated and I know all possible is done for the pupils. Wages allotted for the staff are not drawn, but turned back to meet deficits in operating costs.\n\nI would ask that every possible consideration be given to meeting the needs of this school.\n\n(H.E.

We received somewhat similar letters from practically every other residential school.\n\nFor a matter of record, we have reviewed the expenditures at the Sechelt Residential School for the fiscal year just closed and approximately $1,400.00 was spent in making repairs and $500.00 for equipment, for a total expenditure of approximately $1,900.00. I think you will agree that this is a reasonable amount for a school with the enrollment of Sechelt.\n\nFor the fiscal year 1948-49 we have provided an amount of $2,150.00 for repairs to plumbing and for interior decorating, also an amount of $250.00 for equipment. The items mentioned were included in the estimates submitted from the Indian Agent's office.\n\nWe are prepared to expend the amount mentioned above in any manner that Indian Agent Taylor and yourself consider would be in the best interests of the school and you might let me have your recommendations at your convenience.\n\nBernard F.

A floor will be laid and roof trusses etc. built in to allow removal of the present floor of the hay loft.\n\nA balcony and doors and a fire escape will be built and the resultant building will provide accommodation for athletics until such time as another structure can be provided.\n\nWill you kindly advise me at your earliest\n\nF.T.O.\nconvenience if this expenditure is approved.\n\nIn view of the unremitting efforts of the Principal to provide for the educational and social needs of the pupils I feel that the expenditure of the funds for this purpose will achieve valuable results.\n\n(H.

Taylor, reference his letter of October 16th, has recommended that the $2,150 available for repairs to the plumbing be used to convert the school barn now unused into a gymnasium and basketball hall.\n\nYou will note that the amount available is insufficient to meet the cost of repairs to the plumbing which can easily be deferred for another year. I have visited the residential school with Mr. Taylor and fully agree that the most pressing need is for indoor play space for the children. Of the total amount appropriated for this school, $2400, apparently $335 has been spent, and it is thought that the balance remaining will be sufficient to meet the cost of converting the barn. I would recommend that the Department approve the use of the available funds for this purpose.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nNovember 1, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. W.S.

We sent you an Army Signal regarding the matter on the 27th but as you have not replied to that Signal, it is presumed that you still favour making the repairs to the barn as outlined in your letter of October 23rd.\n\nIt is noted that the material and freight will cost approximately $927.00. Please forward a requisition for the material required and if it can be purchased locally, you should state the name of the firm and the cost.\n\nIt is understood that the total amount that the Department will supply for material and labour is $2,150.00.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nNovember 4, 1948\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn all the years I have been at Sechelt I have never written a letter of criticism to the Department. Since I have shown considerable restraint in this regard I trust that this letter will be given very serious consideration. I am writing because I feel that the accumulated actions and decisions of the Department in the past seem to indicate a policy of discrimination toward this school, and an attitude toward me, its Principal, which is belittling if not outright insulting.\n\nIt seems logical that if the Department feels a man is competent and capable of running one of their schools, the Department should put some trust in his judgments, at least in small matters. On the other hand, if the Department judges a man to be unworthy of trust the Department should obviously ask for his resignation. The Department has followed neither of these courses but continues to make decisions in the most minute matters in opposition to wishes of the Principal and the Agent whose advice is sought in all matters relating to the school. The implication is that the Department regards the Principal as though he possessed\nno more intelligence than that of a school boy. I want you to know that I resent this type of treatment most vehemently.\n\nTo quote an example from among many, this year we were granted $250. for equipment. I requested among other things that out of this sum one electric motor be provided for the manual training shop. The motor was to cost $45. As my duties as Principal require my presence in the school twenty four hours daily, I feel, that at least geographically, I am in a better position to state what things are most useful in the school than one, let us say, who lives 3000 miles away, and has never even seen the inside of the school! Yet, this request was flatly refused although this motor was to be used for the operation of equipment already supplied by the Department. What utter nonsense is this!!\n\nAgain this year we were granted $2000 for plumbing. When the contractors were called in to look over the work it was found that a complete job would require almost double the amount. It was therefore unwise to proceed with this work. As the Department absolutely refused to build a gymnasium for the school I looked into the question of converting the barn, not in use, into a gym and found that a good job could be made of it for approximately $1800. I then discussed the proposition with Mr. Arneil and Mr. Taylor. These men are well acquainted with conditions pertinent to this school. Mr. Arneil has already spent two days here, while Mr. Taylor visits the school regularly many times each year. Both these men were keenly in favor of the proposition. At this time of writing\nthe requisite permission is still being withheld while the proposition is still being suspiciously examined as though it were the brain child of a moronic mind instead of the joint proposition of three men whom you should be able to trust. In the meantime the fall rains have set in and the children are denied the pleasure and healthful recreation of a good gym floor.\n\nThis is the kind of treatment that gives one a feeling of utter frustration in work of this nature. And the above are by no means to be considered as isolated cases. It is the kind of treatment that makes one wonder just what kind of men the Department is looking for. It is most assuredly the kind of treat that I deeply resent. This tightfisted policy of the Department in making grants for the upkeep of the place which are entirely inadequate and then quibbling for months over the expenditure of same is most stultifying to a man's initiative, and would cause a man not obligated in other ways to resign.\n\nAs regards discrimination, why was this school given an increase, retroactive to March quarter mind you, of only $300 when at least one other school more favorably situated than this one received double the amount per child? Why is the per capita grant for this school so much lower than other schools whose water freight rates are very little higher than our own and who like us are not in a farming district and have little or nor gardening\nfacilities? Surely, you have not based the increase on the auditors report, which even the Auditors themselves agree cannot begin to give a true picture of conditions.\n\nIf this school kept out of the red during the past year it was largely due to the fact that four Oblates, working here full time, received in salaries from Jan 1947 to Jan 1948 the grand total of $1800. This works out to $35 per month for each man and this includes my salary as Principal. Surely your office boy receives doubly that amount. It would seem, then, for the crime of making the school books balance at considerable expense to the Oblate Fathers we have been penalized.\n\nI am asking, therefore, that compensation be made for the Department's failure to grant this school a reasonable increase in the per capita grant. And secondly, that our requests be treated with understanding and respect. We are not morons, despite all evidence to the contrary, and we are not, believe me sir, trying to fleece the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. F. Dunlop,\nPrincipal.\nDear Father Dunlop:\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nNo doubt you have already been advised by Mr. Arneil that the Department is prepared to allow an amount of $2150 towards the cost of converting the barn so that it can be used as a gymnasium.\n\nThe electric motor was not authorized due to the fact that we do not consider favourably the use of power tools for manual training shops at Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50, it is hoped to provide funds to repair the plumbing.\n\nI can assure you that we do not feel towards you the way that you think we do but we have many difficulties as well as yourself and we are endeavouring to treat all the schools as fairly as funds permit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nRev.

Dunlop, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSechelt Residential School,\nSechelt, B.C.,\n\nPP/IIIM.\n**RETURN OF LABOUR** on the **Sage Creek** on **Grosset** Reserve\n\nfor week ending\n\n| NAMES       | Nature of Employment or Trade | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | TOTAL | PRICE PER E.R. | AMOUNT OF WAGES | WORK PERFORMED | RECEIVED PAYMENT | WITNESS |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|\n| James Beaver | Cleaning of Sage Creek        |      |       |      |        |      |      |       |                |                 |                |                 |         |\n| James Beaver |                               |      |       |      |        |      |      |       |                |                 |                |                 |         |\n\nWork of cleaning creek only partially completed - cement covering needs to be cut away in order to complete work - work done not yet satisfactory.\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed, materials supplied, and prices are fair and just.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| September  | To labour cleaning out septic tank at Sechelt Indian Residential School, as per labour return attached. | $21.00 |\n\n**Indian Affairs Branch**\n\n**B.C.

S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nThe enclosed Voucher No. 917 for $21.00 in favour of Mr. J. Stewart is an emergency expenditure from the amount made available this year for building repairs and maintenance of Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe clogging of the large septic tank has been a source of trouble for some time and many complaints were received from adjacent residents and passers by.\n\nConsiderable labour was involved in digging out the congested accumulation, and burying it in an excavation.\n\nIt was not work which the School Principal felt he could ask school pupils to do, and it was necessary to have it done during school vacation period.\n\nTo properly complete the cleaning out, a portion of the cement cover of the tank requires chopping out, to provide access to the central part of the tank.\n\nWhen this has been done a further sum of $29.00 will be needed to finish the emptying.\n\nI would ask authority for completion.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nH.

A further expenditure of $30.00 was recently authorized by this Office, but an additional $30.00 will be required to complete the work.\n\nIt is thought that there may be insufficient funds from the appropriation for the School this year, but I would recommend that Mr. Taylor be authorized to have the work completed, even though payment must be left in abeyance until after April 1st.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: No. 15-11-3\n\nI would refer to your letter of December 9th last authorizing an expenditure of $30.00 to complete the cleaning out of the septic tank at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nI now enclose copy of a letter received from the Reverend Principal advising that the above amount is insufficient for the work.\n\nIt had been estimated that one man could complete the work but apparently more labour is entailed.\n\nCondition of the tank has long been a source of complaint and offense.\n\nCan an additional $30.00 be authorized for this?\n\n(H. E. Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nHET/FR\nEncl.\nMr. H. E. Taylor,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nI have been in touch with Mr. Stuart regarding the septic tank. Mr. Stuart says that he will need a man to help him. Thirty dollars won't go very far with two men on the job plus their transportation expenses. I have no one free here as both our men are engaged with the carpenters on the building of the stage.\n\nAnd yet the work is imperative. The Forestry will certainly lodge a complaint this spring as their new buildings are only a few hundred feet from the septic tank outlet.\n\nAs you know the gym has gone over the money allotted. Frankly, I cannot make any further inroads on school funds this year. What are we going to do?\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\n24th February, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $60.00 for properly cleaning and repairing the septic tank at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, 23rd February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Sechelt Indian Residential School, Vancouver Indian Agency,\nProvince of British Columbia\n\nIt is our understanding that one of your engineers expects to make an inspection trip to Western Canada.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50, we have included an amount of $3,500.00 for renewing the plumbing system at this school.\n\nIf possible, your engineer should visit this school and on his return report to us what work is required.\n\nPP/ST Director.\n7th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of Vancouver Agency Voucher No. 198 issued in favour of Messrs. H. Temple and M. Morley for converting the barn at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe authority quoted is our letter of 1st November, 1948, but if you review that letter you will note that no authority was given to enter into a contract, as you are aware that any contract in excess of $500.00 has to receive the Minister's approval. In the present case, no such permission was obtained, because the Principal evidently went ahead with the work following receipt of our letter of 1st November, 1948.\n\nPayment might be handled more expeditiously if it is possible to provide us with labour return forms to attach to the Voucher. These forms should show the names of the persons employed, the number of hours or days they worked, and the rate either per hour or per day. Please let me hear further from you in regard to this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division\nJanuary 19, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Sechelt Residential School - Repairs\nConversion of School Barn into\nGymnasium\n\nUnder date of November 4th last you advised\nthat approval was given for use of funds available from\nappropriation for the above school for conversion of the\nbarn into a gymnasium.\n\nPurchase orders totalling $811.93 were\nissued and hardware to $12.51 was ordered, but there will\nbe a refund for this latter item as the iron bolts etc.\nwere not needed when new trusses were decided upon.\nBoat freight totalled $92.70. In addition to the above\nthere was a contract price of $865.00 for all labour\ninvolved, a total of $1770.68.\n\nOf the sum of $2150.00 appropriated there\nis thus an unexpended balance of $379.32 which you intimated\nto me in conversation would be available for assisting the\ncost of erecting a stage addition on one end of the converted\nbarn.\n\nThe Burns and Jackson Logging Company at\nSechelt are prepared to supply all needed lumber for the\nstage addition for $400.00. I attach herewith their list\nof material. They have not raised and extended the items\nas their quotation is considerably below market price and\nwas offered as a special concession to Reverend Father Dunlop\nwho will use the school's own funds to complete the work.\n\nLocal city quotation for the same material\nis $432.00 plus freight of approximately $50.00.\n\nFor this reason I would ask that a Purchase\nOrder be made out to Reverend H.F. Dunlop as purveyor\nof the lumber to us, to a total of $379.32 and the balance\nof the cost of the lumber, also roofing, doors etc. for\nthe stage addition, will be paid by the school.\n\nThe stage is very necessary and eliminates\na crowded one, with view blocked by pillars, now used in\nthe school building. As the gymnasium will also be used\nas an auditorium, school gatherings will be held there and\nthe present space in the school used for other necessary\naccommodation.\n\n(sgd) H.E. Taylor\n(H.E.

To date, I have not received a refund. Could you please find time to look into the matter.\n\nI discovered accidently that the Department makes a small grant for children resident in the schools who are attending the local High School. I feel it is rather unfair of the Department not to notify us of these extras. However, I would like to know if it will be possible for me to collect for the children who were attending the local High School last year as well as for those who are attending this year.\n\nMr. Hargreaves inspected the plumbing last week. He is totally in agreement with the recommendation I made to you that all existing plumbing be replaced. It is most important that something be done this year. We cannot face another year with the plumbing in such a deplorable state.\n\nAs you know, nothing has been done in the way of repairs since 1939 when the roofing was renewed. It is true that we have\nreceived small amounts for repairs, but these grants have never been sufficiently large to undertake the essential repairs.\n\nThis building is owned by the Department and I suppose it is no concern of mine if the Department wishes to see it go to pieces. Nevertheless it is very disheartening to watch a good building disintegrating. Frankly, that is what is happening here. During storms blowing in from the South East I have seen water actually running down the walls on the inside. I do not need to mention what damage this is doing to plaster, woodwork and decorations. There is also question of the tower which is rusted right through. One day it will fall down and I hope it will not do as much damage as I anticipate it will do.\n\nThe above are some of the essential repairs to be done and which cannot be undertaken with the size of grants we have been receiving. However, plumbing is still our first consideration. I have mentioned the other repairs simply to impress upon you the necessity of getting something done this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMemorandum:\n\nMISS SMITH - RECORDS BRANCH\n\nIn a letter dated June 16, 1949 from Reverend H.F. Dunlop, O.M.I., Principal of the Sechelt Residential School, he states in part as follows:\n\n\"On April the 30th I sent a bill to the Department to the amount of $114.98 which amount represented the cost of transporting the children to Vancouver for tonsillectomies. To date, I have not received a refund. Could you please find time to look into the matter.\"\n\nI presume this account was forwarded to the Medical Branch as we have no record of having received it here.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 23, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWe have received a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Sechelt School in connection with Mr. Hargreaves' visit.\n\nFor the information of the Principal and yourself, I may say that Mr. Hargreaves has returned recently to Ottawa, and is at present preparing plans and specifications for the work that he considers required at the Sechelt school. When these are ready we will be calling for prices.\n\nConsequently, it will likely be some weeks before any actual work is commenced. However, you can be assured that the matter will receive as prompt attention as possible.\n\nThe following is a quotation from the Principal's letter:\n\n\"As you know, nothing has been done in the way of repairs since 1939 when the roofing was renewed. It is true that we have received small amounts for repairs, but these grants have never been sufficiently large to undertake the essential repairs.\n\nThis building is owned by the Department and I suppose it is no concern of mine if the Department wishes to see it go to pieces. Nevertheless it is very disheartening to watch a good building disintegrate. Frankly, that is what is happening here. During storms...\"\nblowing in from the South East I have seen water actually running down the walls on the inside. I do not need to mention what damage this is doing to plaster, woodwork and decorations. There is also question of the tower which is rusted right through. One day it will fall down and I hope it will not do as much damage as I anticipate it will do.\n\nWe feel that the attitude of the Principal is unfair.\n\nBernard F.

The potato peeler is required to replace the\npresent worn out machine. The elimination of laborious\nmanual work in food preparation means more time for useful\ninstruction and tends to make school residence much more\nattractive for the older pupils, many of whom wish to return\nafter the age for compulsory attendance is reached. There\nis certainly no educational value in heavy kitchen chores,\nwhich are only repellent time wasters.\n\n2. The school laundry is not well equipped and in a\nrainy climate the drying of laundry is a vexed problem.\nFacilities for quicker drying are very necessary.\n\n3. The allotment of only $200.00 for repairs and\nequipment for the Sechelt School in the current fiscal year\nis absurdly inadequate. It is hopeless to attempt to main-\ntain such a large building in proper repair and equipment\nit efficiently, unless more funds are made available each\nyear.\n\nThe cost of the equipment requisitioned herewith\nexceeds the allotment by $178.10. If the Department cannot\nprovide the total cost of $978.10 the school authorities will\npossibly find means to pay the difference, as the equipment\nis very necessary.\n\n(H. E.

The main source of trouble in this institute is caused by the domestic hot and cold water distribution system together with inadequate storage and heater capacity.\n\nCold water is brought into the school from a property main in the village which is fed from an elevated tank, which in turn is supplied from a dam; both tank and dam owned and operated by the Union Steamship Company, of Vancouver, B.C.\n\nA two inch cold water line enters the school in the girls toilet section of the basement and the two inch continues and is connected to a system of standpipes for fire protection. From this line in the basement a 1\u00bd inch connection is taken off for distribution to the domestic requirements. Both the hot and cold domestic hot water lines are greatly undersized and what is more, they are badly clogged with deposits of fine silt.\n\nNo means of straining silt out of the main entering the school was provided and this has resulted in the blockages throughout the system and has also been the indirect cause of burning out jacket heaters. The fire line has about 70 to 75 lbs. pressure at the point of entry to the building and a hose test did not indicate blockage in the standpipes. Since the standpipes are all two inch and the pressure is constant, any silt is rapidly blown out of the hose when put to use. Also these standpipes are not used except on rare occasions so that additional silt is not brought into these lines.\n\nThe faucets on all the fixtures are in a bad state of repair and are of poor quality and design. Higher than normal water pressures, the lack of air chambers or a pressure reducing valve, together with quantities of silt have combined to ruin these faucets over a period of time. It would be cheaper to install new faucets throughout than to attempt repairs.\n\nThe domestic hot water tank has a capacity of approximately 250 Imperial gallons of water and it is now being served by a broken down burnt out and vastly undersized jacket heater.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe heating system though of a more or less obsolete design works fairly well. It is a two pipe gravity vapour system without traps at the ends of the mains and on account of this building being smaller than an average residential school, its operation has been more or less satisfactory in the past. The system is served by two square sectional cast iron low pressure steam boilers rated at 31 horsepower each. One of these boilers is stoker fired and the other one is seldom used.\n\nThe stoker was bought second hand by the school authorities and appears to be in fairly good operating condition as far as could be determined. There are no controls and as a result, the stoker is started and stopped manually, which is not a desirable method. In addition, the pressure gauge on the boiler is broken, and there is no means of knowing when a dangerous level has been reached. The safety valve on the boiler could be expected to release at about 10 lbs but in the meantime if such a pressure was reached on this heating system, it could result in damage to the radiators and the piping before the boiler safety valve would pop. Since the fireman exercises great care to make sure that excessive pressures are not reached, there is a tendency to operate the system at very low or atmospheric pressures which results in the farthest rooms being cold part of the time.\n\nWhile the principal did not specifically complain about the heating system, it is felt that the pressure gauge on the boiler must be replaced and essential controls installed, so that the stoker may be safely operated and better efficiencies obtained.\n\nThe domestic hot and cold water piping is in such a bad state that it must be replaced in its entirety. No patch work job could be made to improve the condition.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that in order to correct the mechanical services in this school, the following operations should be carried out as soon as possible,\n\n(a) Provide new faucets on all basin sinks and slop sinks throughout the building.\n\n(b) Remove all existing hot and cold water piping and replace with new and properly sizes lines.\n\n(c) Provide suitable strainer of a type easily cleaned and locate same at point of entry inside the building.\n\n(d) Provide and install new domestic hot water storage tank of approximately 800 gallon capacity together with indirect steam fed heater and self contained regulating valve.\n\n(e) Provide at point of entry on cold water lines to fixtures, pressure gauge and pressure regulating valve to reduce water pressures to a maximum of 50 lbs. per square inch, which will give protection to the fixtures and faucets.\n\n(f) Remove existing boiler return trap and replace with suitable condensation pump.\n\n(g) Provide float and thermostatic traps at ends of steam mains and branch mains.\nIf funds are available three additional W.C. should be installed in the girls toilet in the basement and two new W.C. on the boys side. The present facilities are below the number required for the personnel.\n\nUntil the detailed layout can be prepared, it cannot be accurately estimated what this work will cost, but it may be safely estimated that a sum of about $7,000.00 would be required.\n\nWhen approval is given, we will proceed with the design and specifications covering the aforementioned points, as soon as possible.\n\nChas.

Our records show no means of access to the boiler room except a small door and since this door will have to be enlarged to get the tank in, it must be made large and built up in accordance with the structural detail on the contract drawings.\n\nWe do not approve of the suggestion to use an immersion type tank heater as suggested by the contractor. We have found that this type of heater is more difficult to clean and in many cases, no attempt is made to properly clean or service the element. In order to clean the element, it is necessary to empty the entire tank, an operation requiring an extra effort on the part of the operating engineer.\n\nWith the indirect heater, it is possible to withdraw this element and clean the tubes of scale without draining the tank and this has proven to be much more advantageous.\n\nTherefore if the contractor is willing to place the tank in the boiler room at no extra expense, taking into consideration that a suitable access door will be necessary, we will approve of the change. We do not approve of changing the heater and consider that the heater specified and shown should be supplied and connected in accordance with the detail on the drawing.\n\nC. Victor F.

The work as outlined and undertaken by the Department is eminently satisfactory and our sincere thanks are due to the members of the Department who have expended time and attention to our local problems.\n\nIt is our earnest hope that the attention shown Sechelt School in the past year will not wither away and be forgotten since there is much left to be done even in a remedial way as regards material sustenance of this establishment.\n\nI wish you could be on hand to see the rubble and hear the comments of the men who know their work and plumbing necessities, as they remove what has passed these many years for an adequate plumbing system.\n\nAgain may I say thank you in the name of the children and staff for these first steps taken to improve the material conditions at the Sechelt School.\n\nAs the estimates are being considered in the near future for the forthcoming year, I am enclosing herewith a list of the requirements towards continuing the essential repairs begun recently.\n\nThough bearing seems to be a prerequisite accomplishment of Indian School Principals, I personally feel confident that you and other members of your staff are certainly aware of our common interests and efforts for the schools and doing your utmost to foster them.\n\nI am looking forward to sending you a more detailed commentary on the improvements being attended to at this school when they are completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

For confirmation of their report with regard to the condition of these fixtures we referred the matter to Supt. Taylor and enclosed is his letter of November 3rd from which you will note that this matter was the subject of correspondence in July, 1948.\n\nIt is apparent that further deterioration has taken place in the interval and it is felt that if at all possible the replacements suggested by Mitchell Brothers should be supplied and installed. Their quotation in the amount of $986.75 is based on acceptance while their crew is at Sechelt in connection with the heating system and I would recommend that if at all possible the Department endeavour to make the necessary funds available.\n\n(sgd;)\n\nW.S.

Veitch of Gibson's Landing was obtained.\n\nIn the list of required material which he attached to his tender, the following were listed:\n\n60 replacements of self-closing basin faucets\n22 ditto to be repaired\n8 closet tanks for repair and possible replacement of one.\n10 new closet seats and repairs to balance.\n18 compression stops.\n\nI am informed by the School Principal today that there has been further considerable deterioration during the past year of closet tanks and basin faucets and there should seem to be no doubt that the requested replacements are very necessary.\n\n(sgd.)\nH.E.

Beeching to Mr. Webb with regard to improvements required to the plumbing at Sechelt Residential School additional to those presently being carried out by Mitchell Brothers Limited under contract. This matter has been the subject of previous correspondence with you, reference my letter of November 8th, and it is felt that if funds required can be made available the improvements necessary should be carried out at this time.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Domestic Hot and Cold Water and Heating System, Indian Residential School, Sechelt, B.C.\n\nAt the request of Mr. N.P. Robinson of this office I made a progress inspection of the alterations and revisions to the domestic hot and cold water and heating systems at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and found the work being carried out satisfactorily and in general in accordance with the drawings supplied by the office of the Chief of this Department.\n\nI have, therefore, signed the first progress payment form to the amount of $4,500., supplied to us by Mitchell Bros. who are doing this contract.\n\nDuring my visit to the school, I noticed a few extra items outside of the present contract which I feel you should know about and I am, therefore, drawing them to your attention.\n\nADDITIONAL WORK SUGGESTED\n\n1. Basement Radiators\n\nFourteen only basement radiators should be fitted with steam traps and, if possible, braced to the walls since they are at present hanging from the ceiling by rods and can be rocked quite easily as they are not firmly supported.\n\n2. Plumbing - Basement\n\nGirls Lavatory\n\nFire line leaking at intake valve situated here since fittings originally black iron and have rusted through. This could be repaired and would run to approximately $5.00.\n\nTwenty-four new reclosing wash basin taps should be fitted since the present ones are practically worn out. One complete new W.C. assembly is required as bowl is broken and tank and seat damaged beyond repair.\n\nTwo W.C. seats required for other units in this room. Lavatory actually needs repainting and some plastering work done.\n\nBoys Lavatory\n\nTwenty-two new reclosing taps should be installed for the wash basins since the ones presently installed are worn out.\n\nTwo W.C. seats required. Lavatory needs painting and some plastering over the entrance needs repair.\n\nUrinal flushing tank requires adjusting and new outfall pipe.\nPantry\n\nDish washing sink consists of two laundry tubs which have no grease traps fitted and cause drainage stoppage frequently. These tubs should actually be replaced with a proper dish washing sink since all the dishes for the school are washed here.\n\nThe main steam line which passes through this room has practically no insulation on it now since the moisture has deteriorated the insulation material. This should be fixed up.\n\nLaundry\n\nThree taps required for laundry tubs.\n\nBakery\n\nOne new tap required for sink.\n\n3. Plumbing - Main Floor\n\nStaff Lavatory\n\nWood tank for W.C. should be replaced with new unit since it is practically beyond repair.\n\n4. Plumbing - Top Floor\n\nGirls Bathroom\n\nTwo complete W.C. tanks required. Two W.C. seats required.\n\nWash basin taps in this room appear to be alright at present but it would probably be better to renew them.\n\nStaff Lavatory\n\nOne W.C. seat required\n\nBoys' Sick Bay\n\nNew trap for sink required.\n\nBoys' Washroom\n\nTwo W.C. seats required. Present urinal has no flushing tank. It would be better if a 5\" trough was installed with a flushing tank as the present facilities are inadequate. It would probably be advisable to fit new wash basin taps here too.\n\nBrother Supervisor's Room\n\nNew trap required for wash basin.\n\n5. General\n\nWells\n\nOutside walls should be waterproofed\n\nGutters\n\nGutters are rusted through and leaking badly.\nElectrical System\n\nIn general lighting in classrooms is poor and modifications are required to bring the system up to code. The new 12kw 230v 36 clothes dryer, delivered on September 15, is not connected yet.\n\n\"Thomas A.G. Beeching\"\n\nT.A.G. Beeching\n5 December, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nSechelt Residential School.\n\nReference your 15-11-3 (167) of November 25 -\n\nI presume that the repairs referred to in your above letter are the same as those mentioned in your previous letter of November 8.\n\nAs you are aware from our army message of November 30, this additional work has been approved.\n\nHowever, the account for the $986.75 is to be handled by this Branch and not by the Lands and Development Services Branch. Therefore, advise Mitchell Brothers that this extra to contract of $986.75 is to be billed separately and through your office rather than through the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nBernard F.

In view of this Mitchell Brothers were requested to submit a new quotation for all the work detailed in Mr. Beeching's memorandum and their quotations dated December 16th and 19th are attached.\n\nYou will note that complete plumbing repairs are quoted on at $2,776.00, and that repairs to the gutters and downpipe, using 16 oz. copper, are quoted on at $2,608.00. It is thought that the Department will not likely have funds to these amounts available in which case I would suggest that repairs to the gutters and downpipe be left in abeyance until the next fiscal year and that complete repairs to the plumbing be carried out, or if funds to even this extent are not available that Mitchell Brothers be permitted to continue with the work which they first quoted on at a cost of $986.75.\n\nW.S.

D. M. MacKay,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nRe: Repair Work on Sechelt Indian School.\n\nI am enclosing a self-explanatory letter from the owner of the hardware store at Gibsons Landing, complaining that after having been asked to submit a bid for repairs on the Sechelt Indian School he did not get the work.\n\nThere is very little industry in the Sechelt Peninsula and I am always very anxious to see that they get what local contracts are available. I would, therefore, be glad to know why this work was not placed locally but, apparently, given to a Vancouver firm.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames Sinclair,\n(Coast-Capilano).\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6460, file 887-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSunset Hardware\n\nGibsons, B.C.\n\nJanuary 3/50\n\nMr. James Sinclair, M.P.\nHouse of Parliament,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 19/1948, at the request of Mr. H.F. Taylor, Indian Agent at Vancouver and Mr. H. Hoad also of the Indian department, we were asked and submitted a bid for the repairs to \"The Sechelt Indian School\" this was mainly to renew old work. Our bid at the time was for $2570.49. At the time Mr. Taylor replied and assured us that when the work was to start that we would be advised as to same.\n\nFor your information we have Registered Plumbers who are qualified to do this work and also have a large investment in the business at Gibsons B.C. We find out now that the work is being done by Mitchell Bros. Ltd of Vancouver B.C. and to date we have not been notified regarding same. The point I would like very much to bring to your attention is that this Peninsula and business being conducted here, does at this time particularly need every bit of work possible, especially so if our work, and prices for same are in line.\n\nMay I also add it hurts especially when the Contractors in question are phoning us for supplies for the job.\n\nI would appreciate very much, your kind attention to the above as Member for this riding, and would also appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience. Thanking you in anticipation I remain\n\nYours very truly:\nSunset Hardware (Gibsons)\n\nJ.P. Veitch.\nThe only reference to Veitch of Gibson's Landing is in a letter from Mr. Taylor to Mr. Arneil dated November 3, 1949, in which he mentions a list of articles or items required as attached to a tender submitted by J. P. Veitch of Gibson's Landing.\n\nSee report of Chief, Engineering and Construction Division, Lands & Development Services Branch, dated Aug. 31, 1949. In this report he lists the tenders received, the lowest of which is from Mitchell Brothers.\nOctober 7, 1919.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Arthur Neighen,\n\nThe attention of the Department has recently been drawn upon several occasions to the fact that the water-works supplying the Indian village and the Sechelt boarding school, in the New Westminster agency is defective and inadequate, and that the latter institution is frequently without any water, either for domestic purposes or fire-protection. This school was burned down and is at present being conducted in temporary quarters.\n\nA fine natural water-supply could be provided at a cost of about $850. Our engineer, Mr. Chene, recommends the authorization of this expenditure, and states that in his opinion it should be undertaken without delay. There are ample funds available for this purpose.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, 12 January, 1950.\n\nRE: SECHELT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nREPAIRS TO PLUMBING, etc.\n\nThere is nothing on file to show that Sunset Hardware (Gibsons) or J. P. Veitch submitted a quotation on plumbing or repairs at the Sechelt School.\n\nIn a letter dated April 16, 1948, addressed to H. E. Trylor, Rev. Father Dunlop, Principal of Sechelt School, states that the greatest need is a gymnasium. Copy of this letter was forwarded to Mr. Arneil by Mr. H. E. Taylor, under cover of his communication of April 17, 1948. Mr. Arneil submitted this correspondence to Ottawa on April 24, 1948. Official reply dated May 1, 1948 advises Mr. Arneil that $2,150.00 was provided in Estimates for 1948-49 for repairs to plumbing and for interior decorating and an amount of $250.00 for equipment, and that this amount will be expended in any manner which Mr. Taylor and Mr. Arneil consider in the best interests of the school.\n\nOn October 16, 1948, Mr. Taylor advises Mr. Arneil that the plumbing repairs and replacements will cost considerably more than the amount provided ($2150). He advises in that letter that it would be inadvisable to do part of the work only.\n\nIn the same letter Mr. Taylor mentions the long-felt need for a recreation building. It is suggested that the school barn, (unused) be converted into a gymnasium and basketball hall. Mr. Arneil writes to the Department on October 23rd concurring in Mr. Taylor's recommendation.\n\nOn November 1, 1948, Mr. Arneil was asked to forward a requisition for the material required and he was advised that the total amount the Department would supply for material and labour was $4,150.\n\nIn memorandum to Lands & Development Services, dated 23 February, 1949, they were requested to have one of their engineers, who, it was understood, would be visiting Western Canada, to go to the Sechelt School.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n16th Jan. 1950\n\nCol.

Veitch of Gibson's Landing apparently tendered on improvements to the plumbing in the above-mentioned school in July, 1948, but the Department was unable to secure the necessary funds. Reviewing our file in connection with the plumbing and heating repairs presently being carried out by Mitchell Brothers it is noted that we were advised by you on July 28th that the Lands and Development Services Branch would obtain quotations on the work recommended by Mr. Hargreaves, but on July 29th Mr. Hargreaves wrote us asking that we obtain competitive prices on the basis of a firm tender from reliable firms in the area for the execution of the work and three firms in Vancouver, Barr and Anderson, Murray Plumbing and Heating and Mitchell Brothers Limited were requested to tender. The first two firms mentioned are on the approved list and the third was requested to tender in view of the satisfactory work they had done for us at the Anaham Indian Day School and the Pemberton Indian Day School. We were not aware that there was any firm in the vicinity of Sechelt capable of undertaking the work recommended by Mr. Hargreaves.\n\nAs you know, Mitchell Brothers' tender was accepted and while the work was being carried out the Reverend Principal brought to their attention the condition of the basin taps, etc., and Mitchell Brothers, reference their letter of October 30th, a copy of which was forwarded to you on November 8th, quoted a price of $966.75 for replacement of the faulty plumbing on the understanding that the replacements would be installed while their men were at Sechelt in connection with the heating...\ninstallation. In view of the large expenditure being made in connection with the heating installation we were doubtful that the Department would be able to make additional funds available for improvements to the plumbing but in view of the obvious advantages of having this extra work carried out by Mitchell Brothers in conjunction with their heating contract felt that the Department should be given a chance to take advantage of the opportunity. It was unfortunate that Mr. Veitch was not given an opportunity to tender on this work but as intimated above we were not aware that there was a firm in the vicinity capable of undertaking such a large contract.\n\nW.

In any case, we would not have had the funds at that particular period for the revision of the plumbing system which was subsequently found required.\n\nIn the spring of 1949 an engineer from the Lands & Development Services Branch visited British Columbia, and on his return prepared plans and specifications for the necessary improvements to the plumbing and heating systems at the school.\n\nOn July 29th, 1949, the Lands & Development Services Branch wrote to Indian Commissioner Arnell, requesting him to obtain competitive prices on the basis of a firm tender from reliable firms.

The first two\nfirms mentioned are on our approved list, and the third firm was requested to tender in view of the satisfactory work they had done for us at the Anaham Indian Day School and the Pemberton Indian Day School.

Such a unit could be easily installed and would match in capacity and efficiency the new tumbler dryer supplied last year through the same company.\n\nMitchell Bros. of Vancouver have just now completed their contract for repairs to the heating and water system. Final inspection by the Engineers Dept. was made today and except for two or three details to be cleared up the work seems satisfactory. The transformation wrought by the new installations is a great boon to us.\n\nIncidentally, I suppose the report on the general inspection made by Mr. Beeching is confidential so I can hardly expect a copy for our files. However I do believe his inspection and report was comprehensive and factual as well as official and could serve well as a guide for any future mechanical installations or repairs to the Sechelt School. It occurs to me that there would be evident advantages to having periodic inspection of our buildings by some official of the Engineers Branch. Such men are best equipped to observe and remark on the buildings and equipment we must maintain.\n\nIn closing I must express our thanks for two other concessions made by the Department recently, namely the allotment of a heating system for our gym and the increase in our per capita grant. For your information the retroactive increase given Sechelt will just about take care of our extra fuel bill this winter. It has been a tough year but we certainly are not unthankful for even small blessings.\n\nShould you have occasion Mr. Phelan to travel westward again this summer, we would like you to visit Sechelt officially, or better still for holiday purposes. We boldly promise you that you would have no cause to regret it despite the fact that \"The Playground of the Pacific\" has been anything but pacific this winter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nL.

No doubt you will have heard from him by the time this letter reaches you.\n\nThe all-metal machines are rather expensive, and machines with a wooden cylinder last for a considerable length of time. As a consequence, we have not been purchasing any of the all-metal machines.\n\nI infer from your letter that everything at Sechelt is fairly satisfactory, and trust that this condition continues.

This is a move long desired both by yourselves and by us. The Principal of the School at Sechelt is most anxious, as are all our School Principals, to co-operate with the Mother Provincial in this plan but it brings up a problem of replacements by Lay-teachers which can be solved I hope, with the co-operation of the Department. The plan is to withdraw Sister Antoinette and send her to Normal School but the Provincial has no Sister to replace her. Consequently it will mean the hiring of another Lay-teacher. I will now quote for you from a letter written by the Principal, Rev. Father Viney and dated June 28th. \"Therefore, dear Father Provincial, I must employ one teacher to replace Miss Janestin who intends to remain at home in Saskatchewan next year and this will require a higher salary, ($1050.00 last year), perhaps $1500.00 for a qualified teacher this year. Our light or electricity, water and fuel costs have increased a lot along with smaller increases and so we face running in the red as well as not being able to improve staff and general resulting conditions of the School for another year. Do you think that through Major Mackay or Col. Neary you could get one or two of our teachers on the Ottawa payroll directly? Otherwise shortage of staff keeps having its effect and we face the possibility of not being able to pay our bills or of paying salaries.\"\n\nTherefore dear Major Mackay, I ask you to give the payment of these two Lay-teachers at Sechelt your very kind and serious consideration. You know how much confidence I have in you and I am certain a priori that you will do your utmost to help us solve this situation.\n\n2) RE CONSTRUCTION AT WILLIAMS LAKE - B.C. - It is with a very heavy heart indeed that I note that nothing concrete has been done yet with regard to the construction at Williams Lake and I am very upset indeed at the thought that another winter will have to be passed\nunder the conditions that have endured for so long. Furthermore I am very upset by a passage in the letter from Father Viney reporting on the teacher question, in which he quotes a statement of Sister M. Dorothy, the above-mentioned Provincial, - \"That conditions at Williams Lake have been exceptionally hard this year and she would welcome the closing of that School thus releasing four Sisters to be sent to Normal School.\" We, the Oblate Fathers are very much opposed to the closing of the Williams Lake School even for a period of one year, and I must say conscientiously that we could not allow it to be done without protest on our part. To close a School of that kind for a period of one year would be to set back the work of education in that territory for a period of at least ten years. I am sure that you and Colonel Neary with your experience in Indian education realize the truth of my statement.\n\nI know that your Department as such is not to blame for the undue delay in the construction of the unit at Williams Lake, but I must say that the lack of action is a cause both of very keen disappointment and alarming discontent. May I therefore ask you, dear Major Mackay, to use the influence which your position affords, to investigate the cause of this delay at Williams Lake and to do whatever lies within your power to see that the actual work of construction is begun within the very near future so that the outside work will be completed by the time the Caribou Winter comes. I feel that in addressing myself to you, dear Major Mackay, and begging your help and co-operation in this matter that I am appealing to one who is very sympathetic and who understands the terrible conditions up there. You know what splendid ammunition this delay would make to enemies of the Department and the present regime. I beg to assure you that I am not in any sense laying any of the blame at your door, dear Major Mackay; on the contrary I know that you must be as keenly disappointed as we are. I am taking the liberty of speaking to Colonel Fortier the Deputy Minister regarding this matter within a day or so. Perhaps he can get some action.\n\nTrusting that you had an enjoyable holiday and that you are enjoying good health and that the Lord will keep you with the Department for many years to come, I am, dear Major Mackay,\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n(Very Rev.)

Under these circumstances, we cannot understand why arrangements were not made with the Indian parents to come for their children and save any expense, either to the Department or the school management. In connection with travelling expenses of children at this school, I would refer you to official letter of July 5, 1933. I would also point out that no authority has been given since the first of the fiscal year for travelling expenses at the Sechelt School. Under the above circumstances, the account is not being paid at the present time, but, when your reply to this letter is received, stating the necessity for incurring this expenditure, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nOur funds are so limited, that it is only possible to consider payment of expenditure that has been previously authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo regarding Voucher No.7019 for $35.50 for transportation of Sechelt school children.\n\nI must admit that I have no very clear understanding about this matter. About three years ago I refused to send in a voucher for the Reverend Principal, and he took up the matter with you and it was paid and he claimed that the Department advised him then that such expenses would be paid for children going home for the summer vacation.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Father E.Maillard, is in France and not expected back until the late Fall so I am unable to consult him or find out whether he has any authority on file.\n\nMany parents of the Sechelt School children call for them on their way to the fishing grounds but others claim they have no money to pay fares. I do not think the Reverend Principal has made any strenuous effort to collect the fares from the parents and I feel quite sure that if he advised them the children would be kept at school until sent for, they would all either fetch them or send their fares. They all manage to pay the fares when the pupils return to school after the vacation.\n\nPersonally I consider it should be paid by the school out of their grant. The Reverend Principal has never asked for authority to incur this expense, and if payment of the account is definitely refused, both to this and other schools, I have no doubt the pupils would be sent home just the same.\n\nReverend Father Maillard said he would call upon you on his return from France and you would then have an opportunity of discussing it with him. Of course if the practice is to pay other schools, Sechelt will expect the same treatment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/HM.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6461, file 887-10 part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nAugust, 1934\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sechelt Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: ____________________________\n\nEnglish name: Alfred Wilson\n\nAge: 7 years\n\nName of Band: Church House\n\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: ____________________________\n\nFather's full name and No.: Albert Wilson\n\nMother's full name and No.: Celia Galliace\n\nParents living or dead: Living\n\nState of child's health: good\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nMoral character: good\n\nDoes applicant speak English?: a little\n\nPreviously attended: no school for _______ years\n\n(Signature of Father)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band\", \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

In cases where the parents are unable to pay the full cost, or, at least, part of the cost, the Department will favourably consider payment, but it is first expected that the Principal will inform the Department, through your office, of the number of pupils who will be granted holidays, whether or not the parents will pay the cost of their transportation, and what amount the Department will be called upon to provide. Our Appropriation for transportation expenses is limited, and we have to be careful in apportioning the amount among the various residential schools in Canada.\n\nIf you will forward a voucher, in triplicate, covering the cost of the transportation of the 48 pupils from the Sechelt School, with receipts attached for all payments, the Department will favourably consider payment of the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C.\n\nAER/O'M.\nSir:\n\nre: Your File No.167-18-10\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo re September quarterly return at Sedahlt Indian Residential School, the Reverend Principal advises me with regard to No.0164, Minnie Wilson, as follows:\n\n\"I regret having overlooked 0164 Minnie Wilson in the Sept. Quarter; she is temporarily absent with Louisa, and her record should read as follows:\n0164 Minnie Wilson, 11 years, Gr.2, 32 hrs. at Dom.So. 52 days in residence,16 days in the Classroom.\"\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter regarding No.178 Willard Joseph, the Reverend Principal writes as follows:\n\n\"As for young Willard Joseph, he had not quite completed his 7th year, so I recorded him as 6 yrs old. He has had his 7th birthday since, however and is now in his 8th year. At the time his parents applied for his admission together with that of his brother, I suggested that they had as well wait another year with Willards entrance, but they claimed that the boys had always been together at play and everywhere, ever since they were able to walk and they felt that they could not separate the two boys.\"\n\nRegarding the last paragraph, the Reverend Principal's remarks are incorrect. Willard Joseph was born October 13, 1929, and is thus 6 years and 22 days old today, and not in his 8th year. His father is earning a minimum of $150.00 per month, longshoring at North Vancouver, and is well able to support the boy.\n\nWill you please advise whether he is to be kept at School or not?\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\n/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that you should inform the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School that when preparing his return for the December quarter he should request grant for Minnie Wilson, No. 0164, for the period she was in residence during the September quarter, as well as the period she is in residence during the December quarter. A note should appear opposite her name on the return giving the date and file number of this letter.\n\nIn view of your statement that Willard Joseph is only six years and twenty-two days' old, you should inform both the Principal and the child's father that the Department is not prepared to approve his admission as a grant earning pupil at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J. G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Dominion Public Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report in reference to the four truants from Sechelt School, as per instructions contained in your wire of the 17th instant.\n\nThe children were missed on Wednesday evening, the 14th instant, after 6 p.m. The principal, Father Fahlman, tried to get in touch with me, but I was up coast in the launch. On Thursday morning he phoned the office, and Miss Heelas asked the Daily Province News radio news reporter to include in his 8.30 p.m. newscast a message to me to contact the School. I was some distance from Sechelt, but left at once and on arrival at Fender Harbour, the Provincial Police advised me that they had received word of the runaways and were watching for them. We kept a sharp lookout along the Squamish, but a southeast gale was blowing with heavy seas, and I hoped the boys had been too much afraid to go by canoe. There were no other launches or fishboats at sea, but I notified those tied up out of the weather to watch for the boys, and all promised their help.\n\nNear Sechelt, the Provincial Forestry Department lent me a light delivery truck, and Constable McAllister, of the R.C.M.P., and I drove through the whole length of the road over which the boys might have passed. On Saturday afternoon I reached the School to find out further particulars. Two of the boys were from Homalco Band in the extreme northern part of the Agency; and the other two were Squamish Reserve No.1 (North Vancouver). I was surprised when I reached the school to find that although there are five men, including two priests, at the School, none was out searching for the boys. Father Fahlman said the janitor, Andrew Fahlman, had been looking around the district, but without success. I concluded that all four boys would instinctively head for the nearest Squamish Reserve, which was either Chekwelp No.26 or Kaikahlun No.25, the only way to reach the latter being by foot. By good fortune, a Provincial policeman searching for a wanted Chinaman near Kaikalahun Reserve, found the two Homalco boys, but the other two were hiding in the bush. They later boarded a tug and arrived home in North Vancouver Sunday. The weather was very wet, but not cold; they had food, and found shelter at night. Two are in school again and the other two are leaving on the Sechelt boat tomorrow (Tuesday).\n\nI was afraid they had tried to escape by sea, which would have been fatal in a canoe, as we experienced heavy weather and had an uncomfortable trip even on a launch. We had full cooperation on every hand, and I notified roadworkers, forestry camps, truck drivers, fishermen, and police. Const. McAllister, of the R.C.M.P., who is attached to this office for duty, gave valuable assistance; we searched day and night from...\nthe launch, by truck and on foot, but I think if the people at the School had gone out immediately the boys were missed. On Wednesday, they would have caught up with them. Of course, there was not the same danger as in the LeJac case, because the weather was not severe.\n\nI am glad to report successful conclusion of this case, and Father Pahiman has suggested that the boys lose their summer holidays, and be kept at the School as a punishment, with which I have concurred.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOn the 15th at 8.30 P.M. I received a message over the news broadcast that I was wanted at Sechelt Residential School, and left for that place arriving next day, where I found four boys had left without leave and could not be found. Two rainy days and nights were spent searching for them and the first sight of them was by a Provincial Policeman who was searching for a Chinaman. All four were eventually found and returned to school. The Provincial Forestry and Police services gave valuable assistance by lending a truck, and also in searching and Constable MacAlister, of the R.C.M.P. who accompanied me on the trip to the reserves was indefatigable also. I returned to Vancouver on Sunday the 18th.\n\nF. J. C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-10.\n\nLast year the Department authorized $40.00 towards fares of Indian children travelling to and from Sechelt Residential School for the summer holidays, and the Principal has requested a similar grant this year. The total amount of the fares is generally about $60.00.\n\nAs Mr. Ball left today on his annual vacation, I am writing this letter on his behalf.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDoreen Neelus\n\nClerk to (F.J.C.

Paul,\nIndian Agent,\n418 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAgent's report on Vancouver Agency for March 1940.\n\nOn Saturday night, the 2nd, I received an urgent phone call from Snelt Residential school that two young Indian boys had left and were heading towards Vancouver. This means crossing the sea for five miles at its narrowest, and I had no doubt they were on their way home to North Vancouver. On account of quite heavy storms, I was afraid they might get into difficulties, and commenced a search of the shore line after notifying every person who might see them, such as steamship officers, look-outs, and lighthouses, but it was not until the 7th that the Union Steamship officials found them. They had broken into a number of summer camps and had stolen a row boat, crossing to Bowen Island in calm weather at night. They were returned to school none the worse for their adventure. This incident raised a question with the school as to responsibility for truants. The school made no effort to locate them outside the reserve, as they said their responsibility ceased the moment the pupils left the school grounds. However, we have straightened out that misunderstanding.\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the March quarter return of the Sechelt Residential School you may inform the Principal that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 131 Ralph George\n\" 147 William P.

Hall,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs there has been a drastic reduction in our appropriation for the current fiscal year it is necessary that every possible effort be made to reduce expenditure. It will, therefore, be advisable to inform the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School accordingly and you should direct his special attention to the item of transportation of children. We will only be able to allow a percentage of the amount previously provided.

Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School has forwarded me accounts amounting to $69.65 for transportation of Indian pupils at the school.\n\nIn your letter of November 20th, 1940, File No. 167-18-10, you advised me that authority should be obtained each year for this expense. Father McGrath has not been at the School very long, and, although I wrote him on November 25th 1940 advising him of the contents of your letter, it was evidently overlooked that authority should be obtained.\n\nLast year an amount of $50.00 was granted, and I respectfully recommend that if possible the school receive the same consideration this year.\n\nMay I add that the school has never been operated so successfully in the past as it has under Father McGrath and this is remarkably reflected in the attitude of both the pupils and parents to the School. When one remembers the troubles and trials which occurred there in the past, I am thankful that Father McGrath and his staff have completely changed that situation. I believe it is due to two things, viz., the food, and the keen interest of the pupils in the many efforts made to keep them occupied out of school hours. Sports are well organized and necessary work is not made laborious. The cheerfulness of the children speaks highly of their well-being.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo the Department will allow an amount of $50.00 toward the cost of transportation of children to the Sechelt Indian Residential School.

Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nPupil No. 158 was shown on the March quarter return as 15 years of age. The same age has been shown opposite his name since September 1, 1940. If this age was correct at that time he must be considerably older by now. The same applies to No. 0159 who has been shown as 16 years of age since December, 1940. Please let me know the correct ages of these two pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Hall,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-10\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant regarding certain pupils of Sechelt Indian Residential School, I beg to advise as follows:\n\nEdna Johnnie, No.0213, not shown on March return, died on December 17th 1941.\n\nCharlie Louie Johnnie, No.158, is 16, having been born on November 27th 1925. He is being discharged at the end of this term.\n\nAlice Saunders, No.0159, is 17, her birthdate being May 30, 1925. This girl belongs to the New Westminster Agency, and the Principal advises that he believes Mr. Daunt recommended to the Department that she be kept in School for another year, as she has no one to look after her if she returns to the Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Mrs. Joe T. Wilson, No. 37 of the Homalco Band, called at Sechelt Indian Residential School on Friday last and demanded that her daughter Mary, aged 12, be allowed to return home to Homalco Reserve. There is no reason for the girl to leave school and the Reverend Principal refused to allow her to leave until the end of the term.\n\nOn the 27th, the Principal received a telephone call from Mr. T.T. Taylor, barrister, etc. of Powell River, demanding that the girl be sent home, and upon refusing, Mr. Taylor advised the Reverend Principal that he \"would take proceedings to compel him\". Reverend McGrath telephoned me asking what should be done, and I advised him to keep the girl in school.\n\nI have reported several times on the activities of this lawyer, and most of the trouble at Sliammon Reserve is caused by his success in obtaining the dismissal of Indians on technical grounds when they are brought before the local Courts. If he is permitted to dictate to our Schools also we shall have a steady procession of pupils being taken out on various pretences.\n\nI do not quite understand what legal points are involved in such a matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C. Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to Mary Wilson, pupil No. 0220 of the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe application for the admission of this girl was forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of December 21, 1939. The application was signed by the mother and reads:\n\n\"I hereby make application for the admission of the under-mentioned child to the Sechelt Residential School to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines & Resources may deem proper.\"\n\nThe Department has always taken the stand that once a child is properly admitted to a school, as was the case in regard to this girl, we can hold such pupil until the age stated in the Indian Act.\n\nHowever, if the mother is insistent on obtaining her discharge she is likely going to cause the Principal considerable inconvenience. Possibly you should get in touch with Indian Agent Daunt with a view to ascertaining the home conditions of the mother and, if the latter is in a position to support the child and send her regularly to the day school on the Homalco Reserve, it might be well to apply for her discharge at the end of June. However, at the present time I see no reason for discharging her at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-10\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, you have advised me in the last paragraph thereof to get in touch with Indian Agent Daunt to ascertain the home conditions of the mother.\n\nDo you really wish Mr. Daunt to do this work in my Agency, and is the inference that I am incapable of doing it? Am afraid it leaves me in rather a predicament and I would appreciate enlightenment.\n\nSechelt Residential School and Homalco Reserve are in the Vancouver Agency and Mr. and Mrs. Joe T.
