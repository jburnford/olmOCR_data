The amount of compensation awarded to the heirs of the victims was \u00a315,000. The amount to be paid to the relatives of those who were killed or injured is fixed by the Lord Lieutenant and is rated at \u00a3200 per case, although the family of the deceased in which the injury is done. It will be seen therefore, that Ireland does not get all her amends for nothing.\n\nSpain seems to have a better mode of putting her discontented criminals to death than have some other countries. In Spain, the prisoners are executed by firing squad, and the bullets used are specially designed for this purpose. They are made of lead, and are pointed at both ends. When the prisoner is shot, the bullets pass through his body and explode inside, causing instant death.\n\nThe Woman Physician.\n\nThere is a great medical work for women doctors.
