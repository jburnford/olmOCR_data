P. R. LANDS.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF AGENCIES AND OFFICES.\n\nTo facilitate settlers who are desirous of purchasing lands from the Railway Company, the Main Line Belt has been divided into Agencies, within the limits of which, land can be purchased from the Agents of the Company at the stations hereinafter indicated.\n\nAGENCIES.\n\nCARBERRY\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 11 to 15 (inclusive) west of first meridian.\n\nBRANDON\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 16 to 23 (inclusive) west of first meridian.\n\nVIRDEN\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 24 to 28 (inclusive) excepting townships 14, 15, 16, west of first meridian.\n\nMOOSOMIN\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 28 (part of) to 33 (inclusive) west of first meridian.\n\nBROADVIEW\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 1 to 7 (inclusive) west of second meridian.\n\nWOLSELEY\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 8 to 13 (inclusive) west of second meridian.\n\nREGINA\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 14 to 23 (inclusive) west of second meridian.\n\nMOOSEJAW\u2014All lands in main line belt, ranges 24 to 30, west of second meridian.\n\nLAND OFFICES.\n\nThe land offices for the agencies in the order in which they are given, together with their distances from Winnipeg are: Carberry,\n106 miles; Brandon 133 miles; Virden, 180 miles; Moosomin, 219 miles; Broadview, 264 miles; Wolseley, 295 miles; Regina, 357 miles; Moosejaw, 398 miles; the first three being in the Province of Manitoba, the remainder in the Province of Assiniboia, Northwest Territory.\n\nThe agents at the land offices will have for free distribution maps showing the lands open for sale, and those already disposed of, plans of the Town Plots and pamphlets, giving descriptive notes of the lands within their agencies; these notes are compiled from the field notes of land examiners, employed by the company during the past season.\n\nThe notes in detail of any particular section can be seen at the head land office of the company in Winnipeg, and at the office for the district in which the section lies. These notes have been collected with the greatest care, and every precaution was taken by the officers of the company to see that the work was accurately done. Whilst referring to the examiner's notes in these high terms, it is to be distinctly understood that the company does not guarantee their exactness, and it is their wish that all intending purchasers should, if possible, see the lands for themselves before buying.\n\nFor the assistance of those who are not conversant with the country, guides will be stationed at the main land offices, for the purpose of directing intending purchasers to such lands as they may desire to see for themselves.\n\nTo further facilitate the settlers in making a selection, a short outline of the system adopted in the survey of public lands, and the manner in which the land examinations for the company are conducted, is given.\nSYSTEM OF SURVEY.\n\nThe Dominion lands are laid off in quadrilateral figures, called Townships, containing 36 sections of 640 acres, or one square mile in each.\n\nTOWNSHIPS AND SECTIONS\u2014HOW NUMBERED.\n\nTownships are numbered in regular order, northerly from the International boundary, or 49th parallel of latitude, and lie in ranges numbered west of certain meridian lines.\n\nThe First or Principal Meridian lies about twelve miles west of Winnipeg. The Second Initial Meridian forms the boundary line between Moosomin and Broadview Agencies. The Third Initial Meridian forms the western boundary of the Moosejaw Agency.\n\nThe Sub-division Surveys are of two classes: those made under the old and those under the new system. The difference consists chiefly in having the road allowances in the new system reduced in width from 99 feet to 66 feet; and the striking out of each alternate road leading east and west.\n\nSurveys in the Carberry, Brandon, Virden, and Moosomin agencies were made under the old system. Each section has therefore bounding it a road allowance of 99 feet in width.\n\nWith the exception of townships north of township 18 and west of the 2nd Meridian to range 13, the lands in the Broadview, Wolseley, Regina and Moosejaw Agencies are divided under the new system, and have therefore road allowances of 66 feet on every section line running north and south, but only on every alternate section line running east and west.\n\nEach section is divided into quarter sections of 160 acres, or a half mile square; but the lines quartering the sections are not surveyed in the field, the points only from which they start on the section lines being indicated by a post or mound.\n\nBefore proceeding with the work of sub-division, the area to be surveyed is blocked out into townships. These are laid out the precise width of 489 chains under the old system of survey, and 483 chains under the new, on what are known as base lines. Such base lines are formed at the distance of four townships apart. The International boundary being taken as the first base, the second is\nbetween townships 4 and 5, the third between townships 8 and 9, and so on northerly in regular succession. Section posts are planted on these lines, giving to each section its width of one mile. These become the governing points for the after subdivision of the townships.\n\nThe meridians are drawn from the base lines north and south, to the depth of two townships; but owing to their not being parallel, they do not meet, that is to say, the meridian drawn north from the first base line to the depth of two townships would not meet the meridian line drawn south from the second base, thus creating the jogs between the township and section outlines, noticeable on all maps of Manitoba and the North-west Territory. It will therefore be seen that the jogs occur on the township lines running east and west, which are equidistant from the bases, or twelve miles therefrom. These are termed correction lines.\n\nA reference to the Index Map will bring this out clearly.\n\n**Bearings of Township and Section Lines.**\n\nIt will be of sufficient accuracy for the purposes of this work to say that the boundaries of the sections are true North and South and East and West lines.\n\nSettlers should bear in mind that the lines are astronomical, and not magnetic, the variation of the compass needle from the true north in the Territories is east, varying from $14^\\circ$ at Winnipeg to $20^\\circ$ at Regina.\n\nAs an illustration\u2014Should the settler desire to run a north and south section line, say at Regina, with the pocket compass, the needle should point $20^\\circ$ East of the arrow head on the dial marking the north point, the arrow and not the needle will then indicate the true direction of the line.\n\nThe following table shows the approximate variation at the Land Offices, and is sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes:\n\n| Location    | Variation |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| Carberry    | $15^\\circ$|\n| Brandon     | $15^\\circ$|\n| Virden      | $16^\\circ$|\n| Moosomin    | $17^\\circ$|\n| Broadview   | $18^\\circ$|\n| Wolseley    | $19^\\circ$|\n| Regina      | $20^\\circ$|\n| Moosejaw    | $21^\\circ$|\n\n**Posts and Mounds.**\n\nSurveyed lines on the prairie are marked by posts with mounds of earth built around them.\nExcept in the case of correction lines section posts and mounds are so placed that lines connecting the cardinal points of the compass will pass through their angles. (See diagram.)\n\nOn correction lines they are placed square with the line.\n\nSections surveyed under the old system have their corners indicated by wooden posts, but owing in a great measure to these being destroyed by prairie fires, it was considered advisable in changing the system of survey to use posts made of iron (gas pipes being used for this purpose). These are generally therefore found in surveyed land west of the 2nd meridian.\n\nIn a timbered country the mounds are dispensed with, and the lines marked by blazing the trees on the side next the line, and the direction in which it is run, the corners being established by wooden posts, the position of which are defined by bearing trees.\n\nOnly a single row of posts to indicate the corners of the townships or sections (except on correction lines) is placed on any surveyed line. These posts are placed in the west limit of road allowances leading north and south, and in the south limit of roads leading east and west.\n\nOn correction lines posts are planted on each side of the road allowance, and marked independently for the townships on either side.\n\nIt frequently occurs that a section corner falls into a lake, slough, or stream. In this case the surveyor builds a circular witness mound on the shore at the point nearest to the true position of the section corner, the post standing in the mound being marked W. M., the bearing and distance to the site of the true corner being written thereon.\n\nPOST MARKINGS.\n\nWooden posts are marked with Roman numerals cut into their faces.\n\nWhere iron posts are used, the figures are punched on a square plate of tin, which rests on the top of the mound, the post passing through its centre. In addition to the section numbers, the plates are marked with the letters N. S. E. and W., and it is necessary, in ascertaining the number of a section, to see that the plate is turned so that these letters correspond with the cardinal points, which they are intended to indicate.\n\nQuarter section corners are designated by wooden posts, flattened\non two sides. They are marked with the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$, and stand with their flattened sides facing the direction in which the section line is run.\n\nThe position in which the mounds and posts stand with reference to the section lines, and the manner in which they are marked, is shown in the annexed diagrams.\nDIAGRAMS showing the road allowance, and the manner in which the sections are numbered.\n\n| Township as surveyed under Old System |\n|--------------------------------------|\n| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 |\n| 30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 |\n| 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |\n| 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 |\n| 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n| 6  | 5  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  |\n\n| Township as surveyed under New System |\n|---------------------------------------|\n| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 |\n| 30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 |\n| 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |\n| 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 |\n| 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n| 6  | 5  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  |\nDiagram shewing manner in which posts are marked\nSURFACE.\u2014Broken by the valley of the Souris River. The valley is full of scrub and patches of timber. North bank of river 50 feet high, south bank from 15 to 40 feet. That part of sec. west of river lies in the valley. Strips of high land at north is gently undulating. That S. and E. of river forms two plateaus 'descending' to the valley.\n\nSOIL.\u2014Sandy loam from 10 to 18 inches deep with sandy subsoil. Rates No. 2.\n\nTIMBER.\u2014The timber along the Souris will cut about 1000 cords of wood. A good deal of it consists of black poplar and cotton wood, which does not burn well. The best of the elm is cut by settlers.\n\nWATER.\u2014Abundance of water in river and coulee. There is an excellent spring in fenced field, as shown on diagram.\n\nGRASS.\u2014A fair growth of prairie grass. No meadows.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS.\u2014The S. E. \u00bc is claimed by J. McCauley, who bought it from the C. P. R. in August, 1881. Has about 45 acres broken and backset, twelve of which were under crop this year. He has a good frame house 15x20 and stable.\n\nCAPABILITIES.\u2014A fair section for general farming.\nC. P. R. LAND EXAMINATIONS.\n\nThe examination of the Company's lands is carried on by parties consisting of a chief, three assistant examiners, a cook and teamster. Before commencing the season's work the parties are brought together and formed into one camp, for the purpose of working together on standard sections, to insure uniformity of rating throughout the staff.\n\nFor convenience of description, every section is divided into square forty acre lots, and each of these is to be examined by running accurate lines across the same, or at least one boundary line thereof, and in broken or wooded country at least two boundary lines; but in all cases enough lines are to be run over the section to acquire a thorough knowledge of it.\n\nExaminers are instructed to represent on the diagram the position, form and exact location of every lake, pond, marsh, meadow, swamp, bluff, hill or valley, timber, brush and open land, the position and course of every stream of water or drain, indicating in the case of a rapid current the possible water power and fall of the stream.\n\nFollowing the diagram, notes are written as to surface, soil, timber, water, grass, stone, minerals, improvements, area of arable land, and the general adaptability of the section for farming purposes.\n\nIt will be observed that each forty-acre lot is marked with a number expressing its relative value, judged by the following rule: No. 1, best obtainable; No. 2, good; No. 3, fair; No. 4, poor; No. 5, worthless; the fractional parts $1\\frac{1}{2}$, $2\\frac{1}{2}$, etc., being used where doubt exists as to which division the tract properly belongs.\n\nThe relative value is not what each of the forty-acre lots bear to each other, but when placed in contrast with land A No. 1 in every respect.\n\nA standard No. 1 consists of a tract in which the soil, surface, location, and adaptability for farming purposes is of the best rating obtainable in the territory. In addition to this, a forty-acre lot must in its natural state be such as will permit the whole of it being brought under cultivation.\n\nIf through the presence of alkali, swamps, marshes, sloughs, ponds, stone, gravel, or thick willow brush, only thirty-five acres can be cultivated, this would reduce the rating one half: per example\u2014a first-\nclass forty-acre lot in every respect would rate No. 1; a first-class tract, with five acres of swamp, stone, etc., would rate No. $1\\frac{1}{2}$; one with ten acres of swamp, stone, etc., No. 2; and so on.\n\nThe rating of the soil is given in the written notes, under its proper heading. Heavy clay or sandy loam, with clay subsoil, is rated No. 1; light clay or sandy loam, with a small percentage of gravel and clay subsoil, No. $1\\frac{1}{2}$; Shallow clay or sandy loam, with or without a small percentage of gravel and a subsoil of sand, No. 2. Pure sand or gravel will not be rated, it being sufficient to state in the notes that the soil is one or the other of these.\n\nIn taking the topography, every feature is shown exactly as it is found at the date of examination. Ponds and marshes of less area than one acre are omitted, but these are taken into account in striking the relative value, and are computed in summing up the acreage of arable land.\n\nAs ponds and marshes are represented as found, the opinion of the examiners is given as to whether these can be readily removed by drainage, or whether at a later date, owing to evaporation and natural drainage, they will disappear and give place to hay meadows. If the latter conclusion be arrived at, the rating is not lowered, provided the section is in a district where there is not a superabundance of hay.\nREPORTS ON TOWNSHIPS.\n\nCOMPILED FROM C. P. R. LAND DEPARTMENT FIELD NOTES.\n\nCARBERRY AGENCY.\n\nRange 11 West of 1st Meridian.\n\nTp. 7. Surface is almost level with a soil of sand and clay loam, and a clay subsoil. It is fairly well watered, but wood is rather scarce. The land throughout may be classed as medium farming.\n\nTp. 8. Is well watered by the Assiniboine flowing east, and the Cypress, one of its tributaries, flowing in a north-easterly direction, joining the former in section 21. The north half is considerably broken by the banks of Assiniboine Valley and sand hills. The south half is undulating with a soil of sandy loam. A limited quantity of scrub oak, poplar and spruce may also be found in this part of the township; some bush may also be found in the vicinity of the rivers. South and east of the two rivers is the only part of the township fit for settlement.\n\nTp. 9. Is badly broken by sand hills ten to sixty feet high. A small quantity of oak, spruce and poplar scattered over the face of township. Soil is altogether too light (being chiefly sand) to admit of successful farming, and can scarcely be recommended as grazing lands.\n\nTp. 10. The surface is broken with sand hills, with numerous marshes lying between, some of them yielding a fair growth of hay. Sections 21 and 27 are densely wooded with small poplar, suitable for fence rails; and several quarter sections are suitable for farming. On the whole, however, this township cannot be recommended for farming, but is well suited for grazing purposes.\n\nTp. 11. The line of the C. P. R. crosses the northern portion of this township, bringing the land within easy reach of the settler and\nR. 11.\n\nmaking it available for settlement. Notwithstanding its somewhat low classification by the examiners, there are a number of good farms to be disposed of; 15, 25 and 35 are sections which may be converted into good farms.\n\nTp. 14. The P. W. and N. W. R. crosses the township in a north-westerly direction. Gladstone, a county town, is located on section 32.\n\nThe C. P. R. Company have only fractional sections 23 and 25 and all of 35 to offer for sale. Surface of these is somewhat low, and consists chiefly of hay land. The soil is a black loam on a clay subsoil. Rates 1.\n\nTp. 15. The lands in this township are being drained by Government, and will soon be amongst the most valuable in the Province.\n\nR. 12.\n\nTp. 7. The Cypress River, flowing north-easterly to the Assiniboine, drains the township. Surface is broken by sand hills, with patches of small tamarac, spruce and poplar. Soil is much too light to be of value for farming purposes. A portion of 35 might possibly answer the purpose, but no other section need be thought of.\n\nTp. 8. Is drained in the north by Assiniboine, and in the south-east by the Cypress River. The township is badly broken by sand hills and is altogether unfit for cultivation, and would be worthless were it not for a number of wood lots, about which settlers might do well to enquire. Sections 27 (S. \u00a7), 31 and 33, will cut in the order named\u2014500, 1,800 and 1,100 cords of wood. Remainder of township can only show a few scrub oak, spruce and poplar.\n\nTp. 9. The Assiniboine intersects the township in the south-east corner. Sand hills (in some places 60 feet high) render it useless as a farming district. Wood is scattered over the face of the township.\n\nTp. 10. This township is badly broken by sand hills, with intervening swamps and muskegs. The only sections suitable for farming purposes are E. half 13, whole of 23 and W. half 27, and these require to be cleared of a dense growth of brush. Occasional patches of small poplar and oak are to be found on sections 23 and 27.\nR. 12.\n\nTp. 11. The surface varies from gently undulating in the north to hilly in the south. The soil is of fairly good quality, being chiefly a sandy loam, with clay subsoil. Good natural drainage throughout; an abundance of good water, and a sufficient quantity of wood for domestic purposes.\n\nThe line of the C. P. R. crosses from north-east to south-west, no part of the township being more than four miles from Sidney Station. Sections 25, 31 and 35, when cleared, will make good farms. Several other sections, 1, 7, 9, 17 and 33 are also suitable for agricultural purposes.\n\nTp. 14. This township, on account of the shelter afforded to cattle by the numerous patches of bush, excellent grass and water, is better adapted for stock than general farming.\n\nTp. 15. The surface is gently rolling. The greater portion of the township has been disposed of by the Government to actual settlers. South-west quarter of section 3 and three-quarters of section 5 are the only remaining lots to be disposed of; but these are not all that can be desired for general farming purposes.\n\nR. 13.\n\nTp. 7. Is chiefly undulating, with occasional patches of poplar and willow scrub in the south, and medium-sized bush in the north-half. The north-east corner is broken by sand hills. The soil is a good sandy loam, with sandy clay subsoil. Sections 1, 3, 9, 13, 15, 21 and 23 are well adapted for general farming purposes, while the remainder of the township is good grazing land. Soil rates $1\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTp. 8. Is traversed in the north by the Assiniboine River, with high and rugged banks. The soil is principally sand, in many places drifted into hills seventy feet high. Only that portion of the township lying in the valley of the river is fit for cultivation. Section 25 will cut 900 cords of wood; the remainder of the township bears only a sprinkling of spruce and poplar, too scattered to be valuable.\n\nTp. 9. The surface is considerably broken by sand hills, ponds and marshes. A limited quantity of spruce, tamarack and poplar, large\nR. 13.\n\nenough for domestic uses, scattered throughout the township. Altogether unfit for farming.\n\nTp. 10, Melbourne Station, on the line of the C. P. R., which cuts off the north-west corner of the township, is situate on section 33, making a convenient market for settlers in any portion of the township. Although sand hills and marshes are too numerous to make it really good, yet 9, south half of 13, whole 17, 19 and 31 are sections fairly well adapted for general farming purposes. A sufficient quantity of oak and poplar for settlement purposes may be found throughout the township.\n\nTp. 14. Is chiefly rolling, and consists of sandy loam, with clay subsoil. On west half of 23, 25, 27, 33 and 35 may be found a sufficient quantity of timber to supply settlers' wants. These are also the only sections which can be utilized for general farming purposes. The line of the P. W. and N. W. R. runs along the north boundary of the township.\n\nTp. 15. Only a few sections, 1, 3, 5 and 9 are in the market. The surface is gently rolling, dotted here and there with bluffs of medium-sized poplar, suitable for fencing and fuel. The soil is a sandy loam, on a sandy clay subsoil. Excellent hay and good water on all the sections. Better adapted for stock than general farming purposes.\n\nR. 14.\n\nTp. 6. Only the north tier of sections included in railroad belt. North half of 31 can be utilized for mixed farming; remainder is open marsh. North half of 33 and 35 is good farming land; remainder suitable for grazing. Soil is a black sandy loam, with sandy clay subsoil.\n\nTp. 7. The Assiniboine River, 250 feet wide and 8 feet deep, drains the north-westerly portion of township. The surface is generally rolling, broken in some places by sand hills and marsh. Although, as a whole, the township is a poor one, yet the south half of section 1, composed of rich black mould, 14 to 20 inches deep, north half of 3 and part of 31 are lots which will make good farms.\nR. 14.\n\nTp. 8. The surface is broken by sand hills. The Assiniboine traverses the township diagonally. Fuel in considerable quantities may be had in almost any part of it, while the river offers every facility for transporting it to market. Parties desiring wood lots will find it to their advantage to inspect the \"Field Notes.\"\n\nTp. 9.
