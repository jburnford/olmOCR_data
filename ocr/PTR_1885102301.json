Some of these local forces entered into their respective duties under the Militia Act 1862, some others, as in the case of the volunteers in the town, were enlisted by the authorities here for the defence of Prince Albert and the North West Territories. The volunteers had their duty to do, and looking at it from a service point of view, did it thoroughly and well. Besides which they were actually engaged in the actual fighting, the development of which battle was only a few miles distant from this town. Why volunteers who were doing the same duty, though enlisted under other Acts, should not have privileges of such and others, we fail to see any justice. We advocate their claims as much as it is our power, and we sincerely trust that the matter will not be overlooked here, and that other authorities may accept our just support that we think it deserves. We have so far urged the claims of the volunteers, particularly those who visited Prince Albert, Carlton, and other Headquarters of the Royal Navy during the recent troubles. They took an active part in the late fighting, and this matter by their presence was to delay the advance of the enemy to the tune of many weeks. Actually it will be seen that they are entitled to great credit, as most of them who are now in the North West, men and women, a great many of whom are entitled to the same or better service than any volunteer who has been engaged there.\n\nOUR RECENT GUEST.\n\nThe visit of the Hon. Mr. White must have been a pleasing and instructive visit as far as us, the residents of Prince Albert and the surrounding district. In the first place he actually saw and had opportunity of personally experiencing and understanding the difficulties and perils that the different settlers and parties in Prince Albert and its neighborhood wished to bring under his notice. Mr. Vigne, on his part, did all a Government officer could do, and although his time was limited, he felt perfectly content (quite right) that he did all he can towards promoting the interests of the town of Prince Albert, in the right direction. While Mr. White was visiting the town he brought with him a large number of officers who visited this town for the purpose of conferring upon this town, and we cannot express our opinion that the manner of itself brought more good to South West Canada. But there is no doubt, as far as we can judge, that the officers should get certain privileges and not only, not one for one which does not apply to those under whose care these regulations ought to have been carried out. Had these officers visited this town at an earlier date, we feel sure that much more would have been done for the advancement of the town in general and persons in particular.\n\nBATTERIES.\n\nOn Monday, the 18th inst., about a clock past 9 B Batteries pulled up stakes and commenced their march towards the plains for Qu'Appelle. A detachment of the regiment was ordered out to join them from here. Before starting the P.A.C Band played the town homeward. The Guard left behind me. The manner in which the town was decorated was excellent, the bands playing as the troops marched through the town towards the east side, they are the North West officers and men, a great many of whom are entitled to the same or better service than any volunteer who has been engaged there.\n\nNotice of Dissolution.\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership existing between us the undersigned as \"STEWART BROTHERS,\" in Prince Albert, in the North West Territories, is dissolved.\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership existing between us the undersigned as \"STEWART BROTHERS,\" in Prince Albert, in the North West Territories, is dissolved.\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership existing between us the undersigned as \"STEWART BROTHERS,\" in Prince Albert, in the North West Territories, is dissolved.\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership existing between us the undersigned as \"STEWART BROTHERS,\" in Prince Albert, in the North West Territories, is dissolved.\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nPlaning Mill and Saw and Door Factory\n\nNO. 1087 PRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nA.
