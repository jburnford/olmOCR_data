But this is not all we still desire, that we all should share. How comparatively few, however, contemplate the vast and varied Christian promises of the world, attached only to Christmas to which it is entitled, considering the circumstances that gave rise to it. We are too apt to think what we want, let us suppose that Christmas had never come to pass; that we were in the same case as Jews prior to the coming of Christ, who were looking for the promise to be fulfilled. How helplessly would we be at a loss in comparison to our present state! If, as the Jews had hoped, that a Redeemer would come \u2014 but had first fixed their expectations, they lived to hope, to wait, to see the promise sit out to realize, the benefits arising from the fulfillment of the promise. But do we? We have the promises, but what boastful Christians, no matter what particular creed we belong to, who ever came to a time when they could say, \"We celebrate the day as it should be.\" We look back at a time for amusement \u2014 not for the spirit of the thing. It is to be pitied that so many of us look upon the day as an occasion for a general display, for much the same in the spirit as the bad boy does the ascent of a circus or a midnight party. Instead of this, the majority of us celebrate Christmas with the way the early Jews celebrated the Feast of the Passover. We have made it black. Contrast our celebration of it with that of the early Christians, who, instead of calling for vengeance, our boasted Christian perfection, the light of faith would soon to burn dimly. Our hearts would soon grow cold, but a few years within the collection of living men, we will not fail to see that Christmas is being used up, that sacred season is passing away, unnoticed by. How many Christians \u2014 and they would be glad to be called anything else \u2014 do we hear say, \"Christmas? What may day is no more so to me than any other day. It would make no difference to me if I did not celebrate it.\" This is not the reflection \u2014 the Christian man, we mean, will see that it makes, or should make, a great difference. For this reason we stand to the contrary. Yes, it makes great difference, else many, very many of us would be sadly disappointed. We do not think that Christmas is more than any other day. It is to diminish the importance, little by little, of the Sabbath. In this way the whole of the week is diminished, and the members of the household of miracles. It is to help the unbeliever to propagate his doctrinal dabbling. We see the children of the faithful, the man who believes that after death comes darkness. To just avoid such a belief is more important to many Christians than its great necessity. The spread of infidelity. Too many of us are willing to believe that infidelity and the faithful is not slow to take advantage of it, his natural conclusion being, \"I must protest and Christians I am not, and so on. If it is a Christmas I am not, at least, not a hypocrite.\"\n\nIn saying this much, we do not stand alone, but we see and believe through the spectacles of any particular creed, nor do we wish it understood that we are preaching against or to a particular system, we are only dealing with a gentler admonition than we are. We are only putting into words the feelings that are in our own souls. We do not say, of course, that all Christians, or any, for that matter, should want a face as hard as Job's, or a Christus triumphans \u2014 that there should be no joy among the children of Adam; but we simply refer to the feeling that is felt in disdaining Christmas with something like that sneeriness that it was intended we should do, and that it would be a great pity by example that we believe that but for Christmas we would still be living in hope of salvation, but if we believe in God at all we desire, all the benefits to be derived from the birth and labours of the God-man.\n\nLet it not appearance to know that not withholding the apparent indifference of many, there are others again who look upon Christmas with the same feelings as the early Christians, and that in many a household the simple and affecting tale is told of how.\n\nIn the family of Bethlehem stood Joseph, and Mary his wife, and his mother, and Joseph took form at God's command. And Eve was given him for his bride, and Adam took form before God's throne. That they would take him also, God's command. And Adam and Eve knew no day. But that they aimed before God's eyes, Adam and Eve knew no day. Until the portal of the skies opened, and they knew no day. Of how for many hundreds of years, From Adam until Hezekiah's time, They knew no day. Until the portals of the skies opened, God's promises offered to their ears.\n\nIn these days, the pledge Divine said, That a savour would come of length \u2014 A comforter, a gift from God's hand. Of how an humble virgin was \u2014 A woman, a virgin, in the days of Joseph. She was the mother of His ancient Son. The sound of the Lord's voice came on the night Kent watch they heard the noise of the Lord's voice. When, let us a ring of heavenly bright Announcement, then the old silence was broken, The Lord's voice came in the wilderness of Bethel, and joyful, they rejoiced, As they beheld the brightness of the Lord, And to that city went their way. That the Lord's voice came on them, Guided by its wonderful light. On this the days of happier days. Until the Lord's voice came on them, And entering the ancient city, They found not him on a throne; But the sun shone on them as a glory. And they followed them down the valley below, And they knew the feet of the stranger, As they journeyed on their way.\n\nHow the Wise Men met the way, And the star of the wonderful star They had seen by night, rising high, And following from lands afar, Guided by its wonderful light.\n\nLo, it vanished from their sight, And approaching Herod's palace They heard the voices of the kings, Of this Jews, for we see now his star.\n\nHow Herod, who was filled with fear, Lest from his crown he should be thrown, Said, \"Bring me the child, that I may worship him.\"\n\nAnd they knew the stable where He dwelt, In which the Saviour was in the horn,\n\nThat he also might show them, A star of light, a guiding star, Though he had covered within his heart The knowledge of the Lord.\n\nHow when the Wise Men journeyed, They knew the place where he was born, And led them to the stable where He dwelt, Mary ever after this child held.\n\nAll kings have heard of Him, As the King the Prophets foretold, And rising high in the Horn Of frankincense and gold, And filled with joy, they hastened toward the place where He was in the horn.\n\nFor they from angel lips had learned Of Herod's jealousy and wrath, Of how he would put them to death, Would send his soldiers to slaughter all.\n\nThat thus the new birth King might fall, But, vain are the schemes of kings And false the boasts of earthly kings, And slaughtered are His enemies' hales.\n\nAnd when they knew the place where He dwelt, In Nazareth city He dwells,\n\nWhen Herod had passed away, They knew the Horn of the Lord's birth, In wisdom increased each day.\n\nHow Herod sent the soldiers of his force, And searched the Horn of Herod's height, How Herod from the grave and pool of death did send his soldiers forth, And many eyes are filled with tears, As they learn of the death of them That had been slain by the sword Of the hate of Bethlehem.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.\n\nFirst Door East Telegraph Office.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS.\n\nWHOLESALE & RETAIL\n\nButcherS.\n\nBeef, Pork, Mutton, Sausages, Bacon, Ham and\n\nGAME IN SEASON.\n\nBruch Stalls\u2014QuAppelle Station, Fort QuAppelle, and Prince Albert.\n\nRUSSELL & DAVIS.\n\nBROWNS BRICK STORE.\n\nTERRITORIAL NEWS.\n\nEDMONTON.\n\nThe Bulletin, Nov. 27th, says\u2014\n\nA public school has been organized at Victoria under the direction of Mr. Hardisty and Judge Roulston.\n\nThe candidates of Mr. Hardisty for the Committee is being favorably received in Victoria.\n\nDr. Whelan, M.N.W.C., and ladies arrived from Regina on Thursday evening.\n\nF.
