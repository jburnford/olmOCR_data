The river has been getting steadily lower for the last few years with the result that the schools now run a great risk of getting a serious epidemic in the summer from the exposed sewage which the river does not carry away.\n\nThe estimated cost for both schools would be if metal tanks are used about:\n\nMetal Tanks (2) $595.00\nTiling 450.00\nPiping 300.00\nTransport & setting up 250.00\n\nTotal $1595.00\nThis does not include the cost of the labour which would be nearly all supplied by ourselves.\n\nMr. Jacoby, who would be in charge of this work, prefers cement. I am writing to the Lyons Fuel & Supply Co. Ltd., at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., by this post to ascertain the cost. Mr. Jacoby thinks the cost would be less and the results better than with the metal tanks. I shall let you know the estimates as soon as I have them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPaul Meyer\nOttawa, May 3, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the proposed new septic tanks for the Spanish Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you are securing an estimate of the cost of cement and, as soon as you obtain this, you should advise the Department and a decision will then be made regarding what amount the Department can allow.\n\nIn preparing the plans for the septic tanks, do you feel assured that you are building them large enough, not only for present requirements, but also to provide for any increase that may occur in the future?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. Mary, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nIndian Residential Schools\nSpanish\nOntario\nMay 1st 1933\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe Singer Sewing Machines.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThey to make application to the Department for two Singer sewing machines for use in the tailoring shop in the Boys school here. The ones we have now need replacement as they are so old and used up as to be nearly unserviceable.\n\nCan you please let me have one Singer sewing machine No. 15-88 for general use and another to make caps and mitts?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPaul Myers\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, requesting that two sewing machines be supplied for use in the boys' school at the Spanish Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will not be in a position to decide whether funds are available to supply these machines until we are definitely aware as to the cost of installing the sewage system. Certain funds were provided in our Estimates, and, if the amount is not all required in installing the sewage system, it may be possible to provide the sewing machines. The matter of supplying the machines will, therefore, have to stand over for the present. I would request that you renew your application for these machines at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P.

The work is now finished with the exception of the connections which has to be made when the new toilets are completed. Each school has now a separate septic tank of a measurement as under:\n\nTotal volume..................2' x 3' x 8' x 6'........1308 cu ft\nTotal volume in gl.............8195 gl\nVolume of sludge vat...........15' x 24' x 6' x 8'........1154 cu ft\nVolume of sludge vat in gallons........7295 gl\nVolume of water vat............3' x 6' x 8'..............144 cu ft\n\nPeople in the neighborhood are very pleased that the river water which has become so shallow for the last years will not be contaminated any more. To complete the sanitary equipment I have had at the request of the medical inspector of the District, a cement box made for the spring which supplies our drinking water. Besides I have had new toilets built with which the Department will be very pleased for they were warmly commended by the doctors. I have also fitted the dormitories of the boys' school with new supplies. These two last costly items are not included in the septic tanks bills I am sending you. Considering that I have had to build a large cistern for each school with the many necessary works connected therewith, I trust that the total for both of $1570.75 will seem very reasonable to the Department.\n\nI beg to express to the Department my thanks for their kind assistance and sympathy in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing statement regarding the cost of the septic tanks recently installed at the Spanish Indian Residential School.\n\nOwing to the requirements of our Accounting Branch, it has been found necessary to return the following accounts which are included in your statement:\n\nG.

Such accounts should show the number of men employed, the number of days and the rate per day.\n\nWith special reference to the G. H. Riellay account of $49.00, it should also be itemised, and if Mr. Riellay gave you his quotation before starting work, you should forward this quotation.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will forward the accounts in the manner we require, and, as soon as you do so, arrangements will be made to issue cheque in full payment of the expenditure incurred in connection with the septic tanks.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

You will note that, while the account is marked \"Paid\", the words \"Credit Note\" are written on it. In the summary of accounts from the Evans Lumber Company, you included the amount of $15.90. If, on the other hand, this was intended for a credit note the amount of $15.90 should have been deducted from their account.\n\nIf the words \"Credit Note\" were printed on the account in error, it will be necessary for you to obtain and forward a new account from the Evans Lumber Company. This account should be receipted and should not contain the words \"Credit Note\".\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention and let me have your reply in order that cheque can be issued.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

We are asking them to express to you this reservoir and we are making no charge for the coil fitted. We are very sorry indeed that this error was made but we do trust that this will not cause you any great inconvenience.\n\nYours very truly,\nTHE GURNEY FOUNDRY CO., LIMITED\n\nSales Manager\n\nP.S.

PETER CLAVER SCHOOL,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nAttention Rev. Father Mery.\n\nDear Father:\n\nIn further reference to the six galvanized steel Tanks supplied to you some time ago, we were very much surprised indeed at your sending us the entire bill of the tinsmith for the work of assembling and soldering the six Tanks.\n\nIn the first place you requested a price on these Tanks \"to be made in two sections\" and we quoted accordingly, but certainly did not include the cost of assembly at Spanish in the price which we quoted.\n\nIn your letter of September 14th you made certain complaints as to the very poor condition in which these Tanks were received. We hold a receipt from the Railway Co. for the shipment as being received by them in good order. You should not have taken delivery of the shipment in a damaged condition without having the particulars of any such damage noted on the freight bill. This also applies to the solder and rivets, as sufficient quantity of these materials were included to complete the Tanks.\n\nIn our letter of September 18th we covered your objections pointing out that the Tanks did not require the extra rings around top from a standpoint of strength.\n\nThe complaint which you made that \"the outlet flange connections were not properly soldered\" was the only one for which we thought we might be in any way responsible, and in the last paragraph of our letter we stated that we would stand the expense of having these outlet connections made right. This could not have taken more than an ounce or two of solder per flange - say two pounds altogether and we are quite willing to pay for this, also for four or five hours time of a tinsmith to go over these flanges, but we certainly cannot consider paying for assembling the Tanks and putting around the extra supports which you have put on.\nST. PETER CLAVER SCHOOL.\n\nAs you would have had to bring in a Tinsmith anyway to assemble your Tanks we do not see why we should pay for even one of his trips let alone both of them.\n\nWe note the first item on your bill of expenses is 20 pounds of solder at 42\u00a2 per pound. We buy the best here at 14\u00a2 per pound. Possibly some of the other items are equally overcharged.\n\nWe are willing to pay for a couple of pounds of solder and five hours time of a Tinsmith, and even for one of his trips, although we do not think we are in fairness bound to do this, but further than that our responsibility ends.\n\nWe are enclosing credit note for this amount which you can attach to our invoice when sending it to the Department at Ottawa. We also return Mr. Brathwaite's bill herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE ONTARIO WIND ENGINE & PUMP CO.LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Sales Manager,\nINDUSTRIAL BRANCH.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs suggested in yours of the 18th inst., we secured the nearest local man to do the necessary work stated in our letter of the 14th inst.\n\nOn our part we had an expert, active man on the job with three boys to work with him.\n\nWe riveted and soldered a rim at the top and a band around the middle. We had to solder and rivet the tank connections as they had been poorly made. All this work was considered absolutely necessary by both men.\n\nEnclosed the bill sent by Mr. Th. W. Prichard, for the expenses incurred. Kindly send me a cheque of $49.90 as soon as I shall receive your shipper. I shall forward yours to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 3)\nTORONTO 2, September 18th 194.\n\nST. PETER CLAVER SCHOOL,\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nAttention The Principal.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of the 14th we are sorry to note that the steel Water Tanks shipped to you were not satisfactory.\n\nFirst of all, it was difficult indeed to ship these Tanks in two parts for assembly on the job, as the top section especially was of necessity very flexible, and we were forced to crate them which we did not figure on doing.\n\nWe believe the upper and lower sections were all punched from a pattern or template, so they should all be alike. However, the writer is not positive on this point, and the man who made these tanks is out of the city today.\n\nThe top rim is made just like all open top Tanks of this class, and we believe would appear much stiffer when rivetted and soldered to the lower section. However, it would not be a bad idea to use the reinforcing rings of your old tanks if they are the same size, but this should not be necessary from a point of strength.\n\nSufficient solder and rivets were included in the box of fittings to assemble the tanks, but possibly you had not opened the box before writing your letter.\n\nWhen you asked for the tanks to be shipped in two sections, we certainly concluded that you had a tinsmith available to assemble them or we would not have accepted the order.\n\nWe want to be absolutely fair, and if there is anything faulty in the way the outlet flanges are attached we will stand any expense which it costs to have these made right. A local tinsmith could do this work just as well as any man whom we could send, and we would suggest that you secure the\nST. PETER CLAVER SCHOOL.\n\nnearest local man to do the necessary work, and we will stand whatever portion of the expense that is rightfully ours.\n\nWe will await with interest a further report from you in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE ONTARIO WIND ENGINE & PUMP CO. LIMITED.\n\nCWG/T.\n\nAssistant Sales Manager,\nINDUSTRIAL BRANCH.\nIndian Residential School\nSPANISH O.School\nSt Peter Claver School\nSpanish, Ont., Sept. 14th/34\n\nOntario Wind Engine & Pump Co.\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe are sorry to note that the water tanks delivered lately were received in very poor condition. All the connections need to be riveted and soldered, for they leak.\n\nIt is also stated that there is no number or indication whatever to allow you to find out the make etc.\n\nBesides the top rim is extremely weak. It would be preferable in this case, to use the top rim of our old tanks, to correct this condition.\n\nAs matters stand it is impossible for us to sign your bill when it comes to us and to return it to the Indian Department OK.\n\nWe suggest that you supply rivets, solder and any material necessary, and also send a man at your expense, to have this work properly done.\n\nHoping to hear from you in the near future,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPRINCIPAL\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose the letter I sent to the Ontario Wind Turbine Co. stating what was wrong with the turbine and the Company's answer.\n\nAs suggested by the Company, I had a local man from F.W.Y. Brethwaite, Mind River to do the necessary work with one of our men very efficient and boys.\n\nThis work completed to our satisfaction. I sent the bill of Mr. F.W.Y. Brethwaite amounting to $49.40 to the Company. They refused to pay it but sent a credit note of $7.09.\n\nMr. Brethwaite does not think that the Company has given me fair treatment nor that he has overcharged his work. Enclose also his letter.\n\nThe two men and the boys worked readily and rapidly for as you will be found my letter of Sept 14th to the Company, much work had to be done. Mr. Brethwaite from the Department who saw the turbine could bear witness to it.\n\nT.D.\nI enclose:\n1) Account of the Ontario Wind Engine Co. with Credit Note\n2) The freight receipt I have paid to the C.P.R.\n3) The account of Mr. F. V. W. Prallwalt that the Ontario Wind Engine Co. refused to pay.\nI trust that the Department may be able to adjust the matter without undue difficulty.\n\nYours Truly,\nPaul M\u00e9nard\n\nRev. Paul Mezy S.T.\nOttawa, October 15, 1934.\n\nRev.

It appears that the machine is not working satisfactorily, possibly owing to some minor adjustments being required. Due to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to accept the offer made in your telegram to the Principal of the 29th ultimo, with reference to sending an expert to Spanish.\n\nThe Electrician at the school has written the Department as follows:\n\n\"The governor does not work; cannot be set. The voltage is too high from the generator and therefore harms the batteries. The automatic switch operates at 125 volts and should close at 117 volts maximum. I suggest a rheostat to regulate voltage.\"\n\nThe Principal further states in his letter that, while your telegram indicates that gasoline should be used, there is an inscription on the machine, stating that crude oil should be used.\n\nThe Department knows that your firm is anxious to have this machine operating properly, and I am directing the Principal of the Spanish School to communicate with you. I trust that you will give his correspondence your careful consideration and make any suggestions which you believe advisable. If you agree with the electrician at the school, that a rheostat would overcome the difficulty which he is apparently having, you may forward a suitable rheostat.\n\nI will keep in touch with the School, and, as soon as the necessary adjustments have been made, cheque in payment of your account will go forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

From the information given in your letter of August 11th, the Department considered that the lighting plant which we ordered from Mumford Medland, Limited, would be very suitable, and I regret that it is not working satisfactorily.\n\nNo doubt, your electrician can write the Mumford Medland Company and tell them what is the trouble. An official letter is being directed today to Mumford Medland, Limited, requesting them to give any correspondence from you their immediate attention, and I hope that, as a result of this interchange of correspondence, the machine will operate satisfactorily in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Y. W. Brathwaite.\n\nA cheque for $49.90 was sent to Mr. Brathwaite but he has sent it back, stating that we have made a mistake as we do not owe him this amount.\n\nI am inclined to feel that the mistake has been made by Mr. Brathwaite, as he probably has this amount charged against your school and not against the Department.\n\nOn receipt of this letter, I would appreciate your forwarding, at once, to the Department, a letter stating whether or not you have paid this amount to Mr. Brathwaite. If you have not paid Mr. Brathwaite's account, the Department will return the cheque to him and explain the transaction to him.\n\nIf, however, you have paid the account, you should forward to the Department the receipt which you have obtained from Mr. Brathwaite, in order that the amount can be refunded to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

If, after receipt of these instructions there is difficulty, the only thing we can suggest is our sending one of our men, and as we have supplied you with equipment which would sell in the regular way for approximately $1,200.00, we hardly feel that this expense is chargeable to us.

Rebuilding an extension to Spanish, so thinking the extension could be made to pay under conditions I will explain later, we put on a small canvass of the Towns also the farms and dwellings along the supposed extension which met with encouraging results.\n\nNow Sir to make this a paying proposition and enable us to make satisfactory financial arrangements we would have to get contracts and to find the most feasible & lasting contract would be a contract with the College at Spanish.\n\nWe opened up negotiations with the Rev. Father Miry, S.J., principal of the college and explained to him the advantages which could be obtained by discarding the present system of Delco Power and tying in with us. We also submitted for his approval data as to costs, etc., comparing both systems financially & otherwise.\n\nFather Miry on our last visit which was within the last two weeks explained they had bought a new Delco Plant, but there is no doubt this plant could be used under similar circumstances where power was not available.\n\nSir our reason for writing you is, during our conversation with Father Miry he mentioned the fact he would submit our data to the Rep. of the Dept. Of Indian Affairs.\n\nThis was the first knowledge we had the Dept might be interested. We took the matter up with Mr. William Darby, of Massey who suggested we should correspond with you.\n\nSir our correspondence with you is not a means by us of trying to supersede any authority of Rev. Father Miry.\n\nWe feel benefits could be derived by all concerned if the extension could at all be made possible.\n\nThanking you for any effort you might put forward to see if the suggestion could at all be made possible again thanking you we remain\n\nRespect Yours, Lloyd Deagle & Co.\n\nMassey, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nAcknowledged\nTake up with Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nMindemoya Ont.

We also assist the school from time to time, as funds will permit, in securing the necessary equipment, etc.\n\nAt the present time they have their own lighting plant, and the cost of the operation of this is borne by the school from the funds they receive from the per capita grant or other receipts. Any decision regarding the change in their method of securing electric power rests with the school management, and Messrs. Lloyd Eagle & Co. will have to deal with the Principal, who, no doubt, will decide the matter on the basis of cost to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThos.

Phelan, Eng.\nOttawa\n\nJuly 26th, 56\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nMany thanks for your kind remembrance.\n\nPlease find enclosed the measures of the additional structure.\n\nAt my last visit at Ottawa, if you remember, I asked Mrs. Sutherland in your presence if she would help me in building better sanitary equipment to replace the poor one which causes so much trouble in the dormitory. Mrs. Sutherland then told me kindly: \"You never refused the children we sent you. I shall do it for you.\"\n\nNow it is a real problem to do it at a minimum expense and in a satisfactory way. I came to the conclusion that I shall do better to accommodate rooms inside than to raise a lower annexed to the building. To give an exact estimate would be difficult. These accommodations will consist in a better toilet room in the dormitory, better heating downstairs with a washing room and shower. Is it too much to ask a grant of $500? If it costs more, I will probably pay the balance from the per capita grant.\n\nAll are well at Spanish. I hope that the heat wave does not hit too hard at Ottawa.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. P. Mery S.J.\nOttawa, August 24, 1936.\n\nRev.

As our books for the current fiscal year will be closed shortly after the end of the present month, I would request that you forward the accounts at the earliest possible date, in order that payment can be made from our Appropriation for the current fiscal year.

The work would have been satisfactory only at a great cost. I had the plans made and it would have cost at least three thousand dollars.\n\nMy superior whose approval and help I needed was unable to come last autumn and I was going to submit the plans later to him. It would be too late now supposing that he would approve them.\n\nMay I then submit another proposal to the Department. Our batteries will need to be renewed next year. They will then have the exceptional record of nine years service. The complete renewal would cost $872.00 but according to an estimate from the Hart Battery Co. I could renew the positive plates this year for $405.00 and the negative...\n\nT.O.\nplates for $469.2 next year.\n\nWill you kindly take my proposal into consideration and if you approve of it, please let me have an immediate answer so that I may have the accounts ready for you at your required date i.e. the end of the month.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev.

Therefore, I put the matter before you and ask financial help.\n\nOur present will provide scarcely for current accounts and minor repairs and improvements that must be made. They include paint and cleansers; re-newal of cutlery for boys and staff; 24 new matresses, 36 feather pillows, 12 beds with still more to be ordered; repairs on the foundation of the shoe shop; and an expensive arrangement with local fishermen by which boys are to be supplied with more fish according to a Departmental recommendation sent Nov. 10th 1936, No. 150-44.\n\nThese expenses I expect to meet with our present grant, but I cannot hope to pay for essential bath and toilet installations. Showers and toilets in the boys' dormitory have been condemned. They smelled and leaked into a class-room below.\n\nThese accommodations must be installed in another part of the house; but that is enough. Toilets are not found on the third floor where eight members of the staff and help sleep.\n\nThe infirmary at present has no toilet. In case of an epidemic that circumstance might have serious consequences for the sick and those not sick whose toilets would have to be used as well as give much unnecessary work to the infirmanian.\n\nContractors ask $1250.00 for installing only the boys' showers and toilets. Please see copies of the contracts enclosed. By doing our own buying, using our own labor and hiring a plumber and one expert for cement work I think we could put in everything we need i.e., infirmary toilets etc for the sum that contractors ask for boys' showers and toilets alone.\n\nWe hope to do it for $1231.00. I would ask you therefore to kindly look over the list of catalogue prices enclosed and grant us $1200.00.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ. Howitt.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI received your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to certain plumbing repairs and installations which you desire to make at the Spanish Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that it is not possible to provide the necessary funds in the current year's appropriation.

The foundations especially are giving away.\n\nThe electric fixtures i.e., wires and piping in the barn are corroded and may cause a fire.\n\nThe dock was swept away by high water and the girls were forced to forego several trips in the boat this summer because they could not safely reach the launch which must be kept some distance from the shore.\n\nWe have a manual training workshop set up in the school where boys may do a certain amount of carpentry without going to the mill. They have mechanical drawing and make the different according to the specifications of their drawings. However there are very few tools with which to work.\n\nRefund on plumbing repairs will enable our community to pay some debts and personal expenses such as clothing which they could scarcely do last winter when our \"salaries\" were used to pay for plumbing installations necessary for the children's health.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The roof is to be covered with corrugated iron. Due to the expense involved in steel structure, the entire framework must be timber. I would be glad to know the following: Using the lightest timber possible, what should be the dimensions of the various sills and beams? How many, and of what nature should the roof trusses be? A circular roof is preferable so the building is also to be used as a gymnasium.\n\nThanking you for any trouble you shall go to in this matter.\n\nI am\nyours sincerely,\n\nF.H. Hynes.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 7, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn March last we ordered from the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company refills for fire extinguishers at the Spanish residential school. In June we were advised by the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company that they had supplied the refills but that some of them were unsatisfactory. As a result the Purchasing Agent wrote a letter to the Company on June 10 and a copy of this letter is enclosed.\n\nAs yet we have not received any account covering the cost of the articles supplied to the Spanish school by the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company. If you have this account please certify it and forward it for payment. If not please let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.

I gave up trying to get in touch with the above company. I wrote monthly for several months, but received no reply.\n\nMistakes were made in filling the order. We asked for 12 refills for foamite fire extinguisher, as in item #4 of their invoice dated March 25, 1938, Order No. 3596, File 1 7530. They sent 4 only.\n\nWe asked for 4 only recharges for 2-1/2 gal Pyr Pyter and they sent 12 of a kind we cannot use. The kind they sent is made by the Walter Kidde & Co., Bloomfield New York and the acid bottle does not fit our extinguishers. Instant Pyr-Pyter recharges (Dayton Ohio) fit the cylinders of our extinguishers.\n\nI should like the company's permission to return the 12 refills made by the Walter Kidde Company and receive 4 that fit our extinguishers.\n\nI would like 8 more refills for foamite Fire extinguishers as in #4 of the above invoice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1939.\n\nDear Father Howitt:\n\nI regret that there has been considerable delay in refunding the amount that you expended in connection with the installation of the toilets at the Spanish residential school. However, the requisite authority has now been secured and a cheque will be issued in the very immediate future. I find it necessary, however, to ask for further information with reference to the attached account for wages for the plumber. You will note that the receipt shows that he was engaged for a period of 650 hours. To satisfy our Accounting Branch it will be necessary for you to attach to this receipt a statement in triplicate showing the exact dates on which he was employed and the number of hours each day. Please let me have this at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.

This information is necessary for our Purchasing Agent when securing prices.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. Howitt, Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nSt. Joseph's Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont., May 3, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nNot having heard from you after forwarding to your office my request for material for the cooking class, I wondered several times, lately, if by any chance, my letter was lost in the mail. When Miss Laferriere told me yesterday that hers was lost I felt sure that the same happened to mine, so I am enclosing a duplicate of the order.\n\nIn a week or two there will be rhubarb to can, so you see I am getting anxious about the preserving kettles.\n\nWhen ordering equipment for the Domestic science class, a few years ago, only class work was being done. As each year more girls on leaving school go to work as domestics among white people, we are now giving more time to individual work, so as to fit them better for their positions. To do this properly more utensils are needed and I would be most grateful for the articles, a list of which is enclosed.\n\nA clock is badly needed as the teacher's watch is the only time-piece available which leads her to watch the time of cook and baking instead of the pupils.\n\nAs we have large plots of all kinds of berries and rhubarb the girls remaining during the holidays, and later all the industrial girls, canned, made preserves and pickles every day during the season, and so supplied a great amount of the food needed for the winter. To do the work we had to borrow kettles from the kitchen, which was very inconvenient as often they were needed there. Besides we wore out one of their kettles. We would need two large preserving kettles, each holding five gallons to do the work properly. If the Department feels that they cannot afford two one would be better than none but two save a lot of time and fuel as two can be used at the same time.\n\nI have made the selection from Eaton Catalogue, simply to give you an idea of what is needed. The preserving kettles and large strainers are not listed, but they have them in stock, I am sure.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply from you, and thanking you for the many favours in the past, I remain,\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lenczak.\n\nMr. P.

(RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 4)\nDear Miss Laferriere:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant you may purchase the two single white iron beds with casters which you require for the children's infirmary. The account in triplicate should be forwarded for payment. Please let me know the width of the rubber sheeting.\n\nThe only letter I have on file in connection with mattresses requests 36 mattresses 5 x 2\u00bd. Is this correct?\n\nYou may also authorize Miss Leusch to purchase the equipment that she requires for the domestic science class shown on the attached list. The account in triplicate should also be forwarded for payment.\n\nI regret that I did not receive the invitation to the silver jubilee on March 22 and 23. However, it is not too late to extend congratulations and best wishes for the next twenty-five years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss C.

Fire Extinguishers, and these did not fit our Fyr Fyter Extinguisher. I wrote the company several times explaining the matter and asking their consent to return the refills, but they never answered.\n\nThese 12 anti-refills for Standard 2\u00bd gal. Fire Extinguishers are still here in the condition in which they were received. They are no good to us.\n\nI would suppose that refills that fit Fyr-Fyter Extinguishers are made by the Fyr-Fyter Extinguisher Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Rowitt.\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1939.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I wrote to the Principal of the Spanish residential school in connection with your invoice dated March 25, 1938, amounting to $20.90, also your invoice of May 6, 1938, amounting to $80.40.\n\nIn connection with these accounts the Principal writes as follows:\n\n\"As regards the \"12 only refills for 2\u00bd gal. Pyr Fyter Extinguisher - dozen $5.70\", what was sent did not fit our Pyr Fyter Extinguisher and with the company's consent I returned the refills.\n\n\"The company then sent 12 only anti-freeze refills for standard 2\u00bd gal.

Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nOv., Ont.\n\nDear sir;\n\nWith reference to your letter of Dec. 6th, I wish to remark that our original estimate was for three buildings and at the time we had a good opportunity of buying the galvanized iron at 40% reduction. Now since your letter has informed us of the cost for the required 700 sheets of galvanized, we have made other plans and have reduced the number of sheets. Instead of three buildings we now propose to put up two, with the following dimensions and estimate for galvanized.\n\nDimensions and estimate for Store House for implements:\n60' x 25' x 10' high with 1/4 pitch, approximately 6' and 30\" between studs.\nRoofing- 100 sheets, 8' long; Siding- 68 sheets, 10' long; Peak- 10 sheets, 6' long; Ridge covering or capping, 124', single side;\n\nDimensions and estimate for Storage shed for lumber:\n35' x 20' x 9' high with 1/4 pitch, approximately 7' and 30\" between studs.\nRoofing- 36 sheets, 10' long; Siding- 44 sheets, 9' long; Peak- 15 sheets, 7' long; Ridge covering- 44' single side;\nDoors of both sheds to be covered with sheeting (Galvanized)\n\nYours truly\n\nIndian Affairs.

Howitt.\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.,\n13 Feb. 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a list of items required for the next fiscal year. While all the articles are necessary certain ones are essential and if the Department can approve of some only, I would ask that first attention be given to equipment for the new power house and cement for the fire escape or outside stairway and a root house.\n\nThis work must be done and the expense, if not borne by the Department, must come from our per capita grant. That together with the cost of a Ruston engine and generator may cripple us.\n\nDue to mishaps at sea delivery of a generator from England has been delayed and the power plant has not yet been installed. The present engine, in need of repairs, has been using an unusual amount of oil and gasoline which runs up our expenses. The Fairbanks-Morse forest fire pump is also important for protection as our present water pressure even with the pump running fails to straighten out the hose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

As painting of the eaves of the school is being held up I would like to know if it is the intention of the Department to order the ladder. If not, we shall have to buy one ourselves and a tarpaulin also.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

In view of this fact, we are asking you to consider the enclosed requisition for the year 1940.\n\nMr. F.J. McDonald, M.A., B. Paed., Ph.D., Inspector of Separate Schools, recommended improvements in our Manual Training class and later sent the enclosed list of equipment needed for such improvements. We are therefore asking you to consider the purchasing of these articles with the remainder of the $500.00 granted to your school for 1940.\n\nHoping you will be able to give request your earliest consideration, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When we have this information the requests submitted from your school will receive consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. Howitt, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ont.\nMarch 24th, 1941\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nI am proposing the following request for your consideration and assistance, if possible.\n\nOur Lister Diesel Engine which drives the water pump for both schools has been in operation for seven years, running on an average of seven hours daily; may at any time stop running due to long service. A major overhaul would put it in condition suitable for a few more years, but this would mean a long tie up. In the meantime we would be without an engine to supply water to both schools. We propose that a new one be bought to serve our needs during the tie up of the old one and then it could be used as an auxiliary engine, should a break down happen in the future. At present, when a breakdown happens to the old one, we have to work late into the night to make the repairs necessary. So far we have been fortunate enough to always finish on time for the daily consumption of water by the schools, especially the Girls school, where the laundry for boys and girls is washed. Due to the rise in prices of materials, taxes and cut in our grant this year, we can not see our way clear to spend the sum of money re-\nquired to purchase the engine we need. So we are making a request to the Dept. to purchase this engine for us.\n\nThe engine needed for our purpose is a 3 H.P. Lister Diesel Engine, tank cooled, price $396.00 F.O.B. Toronto. I am enclosing their letter to us on this engine.\n\nWe are also in need of a Tractor for our farm work. We are not asking the Dept. to purchase one, but we wish to let you know about our needs, in case you should hear of one being idle, in one or other of the Depts at Ottawa. Fr. Hawkins, told me that he knew of a new tractor, not in use, when he was there, at Heron Bay, Pic River Reserve. This tractor might be available for us and would serve our needs. Of course, we do not want to take this tractor away from Heron Bay, if it can be used up there.\n\nHoping you will be able to aid us, especially with a Diesel Engine, I remain,\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 4)\nDear Father Howitt:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant requesting the Department to purchase a Lister Diesel engine for the Spanish School.\n\nAs you are aware the current month ends the present fiscal year and there are no funds available for this purchase at the moment.\n\nHowever, in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42 we were able to provide an amount of $200.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Spanish School. There will, therefore, be sufficient available for the purchase of the engine to which you refer in your letter. In the letter of February 5, 1941, from the Lister Company and which you sent with your letter it is noted that they stated that they were forwarding you a specification sheet of this engine. I should appreciate receiving this as we have to have very definite information to place before our Purchasing Agent. Please let me have your reply immediately and as soon as funds are available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42 arrangements will be made with our Purchasing Agent to secure the engine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Lister, and included the tank in the specification.\n\nHowever in view of the contents of your letter of the 3rd instant, and since your Toronto principals have now confirmed the price as less tank, we will accept delivery of the engine as shipped, less tank, and honour your invoices accordingly.\n\nWe are securing additional information from Indian Affairs Branch regarding the tank, and will advise you in due course if it is required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nConsolidated Engines and Machinery Company Limited,\n420 Laguerri\u00e8re St. W.,\nMontreal, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 18th (File 36-0-5) in regard to the appropriation for repairs etc., I have spoken to Miss Laferriere at the Girls' School and she informs me that they could use paint to advantage, also that repairs have been necessary for the roof. For these repairs they engaged a man from Sudbury. Would the Department consider applying part of the appropriation to pay the expenses of these repairs?\n\nAs for our school here, there is no end to the repairs it needs and improvements. At present the big dormitory is 87\u00bd feet long by 42\u00bd feet wide. That is big enough for about 65 beds. Instead of 65, we have 107 beds in it, besides their sinks for washing and the corner reamed off for a prefect. It is anything but right. My intention is to take the present infirmary and adjacent room and turn it all into dormitory space. That will give us one dormitory 87\u00bd by 42\u00bd and a second one approximately 90 ft. by 18 ft. We are going to do that this summer if we can.\n\nSecondly, at present, for the 126 boys here, there are four sinks only, with four taps only each, for their washing facilities. We must make a wash-room and after much consideration have our plans made for one. It will be as it were between the two dormitories and will be convenient for both. It will accommodate approximately 68 at a time.\n\nI am enclosing a detailed list of the piping and fittings we will require for the washroom.\n\nThese alterations will necessitate some paint also. I prefer the white lead\u2014we can mix our colours. We will also need Boiled Linseed Oil and Turpentine.\n\nThe toilets are sadly in need of improvement\u2014it will suffice to say that there are no seats on them\u2014just the bowls.\nR.A. Hoey:\n\nThe springs and mattresses in the dormitories are, as the little Indian boys would say, \"very sad\" in general.\n\nIt seems to me that the Principal should have a filing cabinet for the records, etc., also a typewriter. The one I am using is a borrowed one. Have you any second hand office equipment (office desk?) on hand?\n\nI understand that Mr. Phelan has visited the school here in the past. He could then verify the statements I have made in this letter.\n\nTrusting we may be able to have some assistance in our needs,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) C.A.

Note the saw-toothed edge. That's what gives the new Rosco Flashing Hook its bulldog grip. \"It never lets go\", but costs no more than an ordinary hook. Its saw-toothed edge makes its own purchase and gives the smart job permanence.

I have been assured, however, by the Purchasing Agent that the typewriter they are sending forward will be in good condition and almost as good as new. You will note, and if possible act upon, the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of the Purchasing Agent's memorandum. It is of the utmost importance that all old typewriters be returned to the Department for reconditioning or for use in repairing other machines.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

As Mr. Philan suggested, I have allowed $300 for the Girls' School which would be used as you approved to defray the cost of labour for their repair to the roof etc., and for the fire-places requested in the enclosed requisition. Their invoices for the labour mentioned above have not yet been delivered to me but I shall forward them on receipt of the same.\n\nThe $700 which would be left for the Boys' School has already been partly used (about $150) to purchase the piping and fittings for the Boys' Wash Room. The balance, I suggest, could be best used in purchasing the Paint etc. requested on the enclosed requisition, and to pay the labour required to make the repairs, or rather some of them, needed (kitchen, etc.), and to purchase what further equipment may be suitable for the kitchens. We needed linoleum for the kitchen -- it is going off the market; that is the laid linoleum, and I had a chance to buy some that was of the pattern we wanted -- so I went ahead and bought it. It cost $126.95 less 10% discount, that is $114.25. Whether you would approve this expenditure or not, I don't know. If not, I shall pay for it myself and have you apply the amount thus left of the $700 for some other needed equipment. I know your position in regard to expenditures over $50.00, so will not be surprised if you prefer that I should not submit the linoleum.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBill to be covered by the appropriation for repairs and equipment.\n\nWith the wish that the enclosed requisition be approved,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Row) C.

They in turn passed on our order to their Toronto Office. The Toronto Office in turn have written to me to say that a high Priority Rating will be necessary. Could you assist us in obtaining this Priority Rating? Possibly the Purchasing Division could obtain the Rating for us.\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 15, may I reply as follows:\n\n(a) Item 1. White paint. This is for inside use.\n\n(b) Item 6. Wash basins. Size about 12\u00bd in. diameter. I do not think that graniteware or enamelware would be advisable as they would chip them. Perhaps I should call them rather wash bowls. They are to be used individually by the boys and will not be attached to plumbing fixtures. There is a type which I believe is called \"Monel\" that would be suitable. If not then I guess there is only tin to fall back upon.\n\n(c) Last item. Fire hose. Yes, 2-100' and 1-50' length would answer the purpose. I have consulted the Girls' School again and find that the hose is rather 2\u00bd in diameter, fitted into 2\u00be\" coupling. (two and one-quarter inch coupling, inside thread). We have cut off the coupling from one end so that you may have a sample. The hose was obtained from Wilson & Cousins, Toronto, I understand. If possible, we would appreciate the return of this coupling.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. H.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

JACKSON\n\nI am sending forward herewith File No. 36-0-24, Spanish Residential School Audit.\n\nThe Spanish School has at this date an enrolment of 250 pupils, for which we allow per capita grant of $160, paid on the basis of 92.24%. This school, the only residential school operated by the Jesuit Order in Canada, consists of two main buildings, both of stone construction - one for girls and the other for boys. In addition to the main buildings, there are the ordinary outdoor buildings - barns, stables, machine sheds, etc.\n\nThis school has been operated at a loss over a period of years, despite frequent changes in the principalship. The present Principal, Father Primeau, who was recently appointed, visited the Department twice during the summer months. He intimated at that time that the boys' building, particularly the interior, was in somewhat deplorable condition and was urgently in need of repair. It was his intention also, at that time to undertake a certain amount of reconstruction with the object of enlarging the dormitories. The small dormitories that existed at that time were, in his judgment, very insanitary. In view of the large enrolment and the fact that this is the only Catholic residential school in the eastern section of Ontario and the school to which we send a great many orphans from the province of Quebec, it was decided to allow Father Primeau $1,000 for repairs. The paint referred to by you in our telephone conversation will form part of this allowance. This is, as you have stated, a church-owned school. The expenditures on repairs at this school, however, have been very low over a long period of years. You will note, in the audit statement, that the church authorities have been spending substantial sums on the repair of these buildings from year to year.\n\nI would certainly appreciate it if a definite decision were reached in respect to the policy of the Government on the repair, operation and general upkeep of these church-owned residential schools. I am convinced, after my recent visit to Mount Elgin - a report of which will reach you in due course - that these residential schools should either be kept in a good state of repair or closed. I do not believe, however, that the purchase of paint would mean much one way or the other. If we are to work in close cooperation with these principals, there has got to be a certain amount of \"Give and Take\" on both sides.\n\nI should like to direct your attention particularly to the salaries paid to the staff at this institution. Were it not for the voluntary services of this staff to accept a nominal salary, the institution could not operate under the present financial arrangement.\n\nIt is my understanding that a delegation representing the churches will interview the Minister toward the\nend of December. It has occurred to me that the operation, repair and upkeep of our residential schools, particularly the church-owned schools, might be carefully reviewed at that time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. Hey:\n\nI discussed this matter with the Minister. He inquired what had been the practice in the past regarding the assistance granted to the churches in respect to government-owned and church-owned institutions and if the policy was different in regard to the two classes of schools. He expressed the view that it would be interesting to have a statement prepared showing - say over a period of the last five years - what money had been spent in repairs, either directly by the Government or by way of grant to both classes, showing separately the schools operated by the Roman Catholic church and those operated by the other denominations. Would there be much trouble in preparing this statement?\n\nIn so far as the particular request is concerned for the repairs to the Spanish Indian Residential School, the last audit statement showing the joint operations of both the boys and girls schools would indicate that they are not being operated at a loss. Under the circumstances, therefore, and in view of the present need for economy, it is thought that the church should be asked to look after this expense.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.W.

Of this number, 27 are church-owned. Five of these are owned by the Anglican Church, one by the United Church of Canada and 21 by the Catholic Church.\n\nThere is nothing on record here to indicate that until the year 1936 a distinction has been made throughout the years in respect to the repair and upkeep of church-owned schools on the one hand and the repair and upkeep of government-owned schools on the other. Since 1936 all grants and expenditures for repairs at church-owned schools have been authorized by Order-in-Council. There has been a tendency during the last six years, also, to spend a larger proportion of the funds available on government-owned buildings, with the result of raising the comparatively modern school from rapid deterioration. The funds at our disposal have never been adequate at any time in recent years to keep all our schools in a thorough state of repair. In this connection I may point out that $10,000.00 is provided, annually, by the New England Company for the repair and purchase of equipment at the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont., and the St. George School, Lytton, B. C. This amount, which is about double what is allowed for repairs and equipment at other schools, has always been fully expended and, in the case of the Mohawk Institute, is scarcely sufficient to keep the school and farm buildings in what one might consider a good state of repair.\n\nEstimates prepared by provincial governments indicate that at mental hospitals with farms attached and at homes for delinquent boys and girls where farms are operated, per capita allowances of between $35.00 and $25.00 per annum is granted for equipment and repairs and usually $1,000.00 per inmate allowed for the construction of new buildings.\n\nFrom the standpoint of equity, it would be exceedingly difficult to justify lower levels of expenditure on church-owned schools than on schools constructed by the Government, unless compensation was allowed the churches by way of increased per capita grants. For example, the\nFort William Residential School - a church-owned institution with an enrolment of 95 pupils has the lowest per capita allowance ($180.00) of any residential school in the province of Ontario. You will note that the repair costs at this school for the 7 year period amount to $64,234.66 per annum. It would, of course, be wholly impossible to keep an institution such as this in operation if the salaries paid to the teachers and staff of such institutions were paid to the members of the Fort William staff.\n\nThe Spanish Residential School, referred to in the memorandum of the Superintendent of Welfare and Training dated November 11, 1942, has at this date an enrolment of 250 pupils and receives a per capita allowance of $180.00 annually. It is interesting, from the standpoint of government expenditures or disbursements, to compare this church-owned school with the Qu'Appelle Residential School - a government-owned institution with an enrolment of 250 pupils. The per capita allowance at this school is $170.00 per annum. The Qu'Appelle School was rebuilt in 1924 at cost to the Government of $100,000.00. This figure includes the cost of the school itself, an addition that was made later, the cost of the land, farm buildings and the cost of equipment. The annual interest charge on this property at 2% amounts to $6,000.00 per annum. Depreciation on fireproof or semi-fireproof buildings is usually allowed at the rate of 1/2% and farm buildings at 5%. If we allow depreciation at Qu'Appelle at the rate of 2% per annum, or $4,000.00, this means an annual charge on government funds amounting to $10,000.00... This works out at $40.00 per pupil, to which we must add an additional amount of $10.00 per pupil, or $50.00 - the amount received by Qu'Appelle over and above the per capita amount received at Spanish. To complete the figure, you will note that the repair costs at Qu'Appelle for the period under review amounted to $46,121.27, or $24.86 per pupil per annum, and at Spanish, $6,302.28, or $25.21 per pupil per annum. In other words, the actual cost to the Department for each pupil now enrolled at Spanish is $163.34 and at Lebret (Qu'Appelle) $234.66, or a difference of $71.32 per pupil per annum. I have selected these two schools for the simple reason that the enrolment at this date is the same. The comparison, I am convinced, might be made with equal results if I had selected such schools as Brandon, Kamloops or Shingwauk or Edmonton. These are all modern buildings where the government outlay has been quite substantial.\n\nIn comparing costs at church and government-owned residential schools, one must keep in mind the fact that while government-owned schools and the lands attached thereto are exempt from municipal taxation, church-owned schools and lands enjoy no such exemption. Municipal taxes at such schools as Spanish, Fort William, Squamish, St. Mary's Mission and Neurville are quite substantial. The Squamish School is located in what is virtually a suburb of North Vancouver and the Fort William school in a suburb of Fort William City.\n\nI am attaching hereto a historic sketch of Indian Education prepared a few years ago by Mr. G. M. Matheson, who was for a number of years Head of our Records Branch. At the time of Confederation there were three residential schools in operation in Canada; the Mohawk Institute, built and maintained by the New England Company.\nof London, England; the Mount Elgin Institute, Canada, built by the Wesleyan Missionary Society and supported by this society and by contributions from India; some others such as Wabamun's Residential School (non-Spanish) built and maintained by the Jesuit Order.\n\nUnder the British North America Act the Dominion Government became wholly responsible for Indian education, but this responsibility was assumed very gradually and has never at any time been fully assumed. For example, it was not until 1895 that the Government established residential schools in western Canada. However, since 1867 the Government has always worked closely with the churches of Canada in promoting a worthwhile Indian educational program, but the Indian educational policy of the Government has never been clearly defined. From the outset, it appears the Government assisted the Churches in the repair and maintenance of schools and permitted the Church to become wholly responsible for the administration and operation of residential schools and, in addition, extended to the Bishop of the Catholic and Anglican Churches and to the Home Mission Board of the United and Presbyterian Churches the right, in certain cases, to nominate Indian day school teachers. This policy, or lack of policy, has never been wholly satisfactory either from the standpoint of the Government or from the standpoint of the Churches. The practice followed has created from time to time a number of somewhat delicate and difficult situations and problems. It is just possible that the time has arrived when the whole policy and practice of Indian educational effort might be very carefully reviewed.\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario,\nDecember 16, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nEnclosed please find negative requested by you, also another one that I managed to obtain.\n\nReference my letter to you under date of October 26th last\u2014may I ask if anything has been done towards obtaining the required Priority Rating for us?\n\nAlso, with reference to our requisition of September 26, may I ask if anything is being done in regard to the paint and oil and brushes?\n\nAlso, may I ask if the account of repair work on the Girls' School, sent by me to you on October 16th, is being allowed as part of the portion of the $1000 allotted us for repairs this year?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.A.

I also regret that payment of the account submitted for expenditures at the Girls' School cannot be paid. The responsible officials have very carefully considered these requests and the decision has been given in the negative.\n\nI am still endeavouring to obtain the priority rating which you requested in your letter of October 26.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Primeau, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Spanish Indian Residential School\n\nThe Principal of this school states that a cooling tank is required for the generators. He wrote to the Consolidated Engines and Machinery Company, Limited, 480 Lagauchetiere Street W., Montreal. They in turn passed on the order to their Toronto office. The Toronto office has written to the Principal to say that a high priority rating will be necessary. The Principal requests our assistance in securing this rating.\n\nAs you are aware, the Spanish Residential School has an authorized pupilage of 250. The lighting motor is failing at frequent intervals due to the fact that the cooling tank is leaking badly. It has been repaired several times and has now reached the stage where further repairs are impossible. The school management is prepared to pay for the cooling tank from their own funds but, as stated above, simply require our assistance in securing a priority rating. If it is at all possible, I would appreciate any assistance you could give them in this particular regard.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Phelan and I have reviewed the attached accounts and it is found that on the one dated July 17 there is an item of $79.80 for labour and on the one dated June 19 there is an item of $155.70 for labour.\n\nPlease have two other accounts prepared by the Laberge Lumber Company for the two items of labour mentioned above. These should show the dates on which work was actually performed, the number of hours and the rate per hour.\n\nA separate account should be forwarded for the materials supplied as shown on the two accounts which we are returning. If you do this I feel that we will be able to handle payment of all or the majority of the items mentioned. I expect to be in a position to write to you later regarding the paint which we were previously unable to secure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We need a lot of lumber for the repairs necessary. To buy the lumber necessary would run into a good deal. Our intention is to buy just logs instead. We ourselves will saw the logs. By so doing we can, we expect, get our lumber for about $18.00 (eighteen dollars) a thousand.

Would this suit the purpose for which you require it? With regard to your request for 150 gallons of red oxide roof paint, I forget what surface you said you intended to paint. Is it the roof of the barn or the sides of the barn? Some types of this particular brand of paint cannot be obtained under any circumstances, due to present conditions. In any case the price would be probably $25.00 or $30.00 a gallon, which would make a total expenditure of a considerable amount. I wish you would let me have more definite information regarding this item before we make any further move.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G.A.

We would like to have 15 gallons of a plastic black tar roofing paint. Perhaps you would prefer us to obtain some quotations?\n\nIn regard to the red oxide paint, we need it to paint the mill, barn, dryshed, etc. It is not just for roofing purposes but for the sides and all. I have looked back through the files and I see that you got us some red barn paint from Scarfe and Co., Ottawa, at $1.75 per gal. in 1941.\n\nIn regard to the roof paint, Alex Murray and Co. have a roof coating that is quoted at $4.50 per 5 gals., covering 1200 sq. ft.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

I hope that you will forgive me\u2014there has been no malice in my tardiness\u2014just a case of not getting it done, though I had asked our workman to do it several times. Today I finally went up myself and the spring which I am forwarding under separate cover is the result.\n\nYou asked for the inside measurements of the bed frame. The most common size, which can also be adapted to fit smaller ones, is 67 inches long by 32 inches wide. That is the inside measurements of the frame of the bed spring.\n\nThank you, sincerely, for all your trouble in this matter. I do hope that the spring we are sending will be what you desired.\n\nWith kindest wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) G.A. Primeau, S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. W.S.

Will you kindly answer the following questions?\n\n1. What is the length, width and height of the chapel?\n2. How many windows are there?\n3. What are the sizes of the windows?\n4. What is the distance of the air space between the outside stone wall and the inside panel?\n\nIn order to get the information for number four, it will be necessary to remove the wall panel. Usually, these panels are nailed on two by two firring strips but in this case they might be nailed on two by four, which would give us the depth and air space of three and one half inches. It is therefore, necessary to know the depth of this air space for it will greatly affect the amount of material required.\n\nI have received one estimate on material $660, f.o.b. Spanish. This was calculated on the assumption that it was a three and one half inch air space. I am awaiting estimates from two other companies.

However, we will require more complete information regarding the type of machine required. You should let me know if it is operated by gasoline engine or electrically.

I would much appreciate your advice on several counts.\n\nIn a letter in the files dated March 10th 1946 Father Primeau asks that the balance of the funds available for repairs and improvements in the school for the then closing fiscal year should be applied to the purchase of white ready mixed paint for inside painting. The paint came in April and was used. On the thirtieth of July we received a bill from the Canadian Industries Limited in which the paint is billed as... Sold to... Department of Mines and Resources Shipped to Rev C.A. Primeau Principal Indian Residential School Spanish. As there is no return letter from your office on file with the one mentioned written by Father Primeau on March 10th I thought best to ask about it. Do we simply write out a voucher and send the voucher to the company along with their bills or do we send voucher and bills to the Department? The bill amounts to $203.35. Invoices TW33270 and TW33436.\n\nYours truly,\n(Rev) John R Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa Canada\nIndian Residential School  \nSpanish Ontario  \nAugust 14th 1945\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 9th (File 36-0-5) in regard to the washing machine for the girls' school I find there is a copy of a letter to you from Father Primeau dated July 27th. This letter must have gone astray. May I quote from it:\n\n\"Miss St James went to Toronto and saw the machines upon which you had quoted us prices received from the purchasing branch. She decided in favour of the machine made by the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company Ltd. (per J.E.G.Becours Ottawa) price $1,075.00 dollars f.o.b. Spanish cylinder 36x54. There will not be any need of an electric motor for starting it or operating it. I believe that as quoted it includes such a motor. It will have to be suitable for steam operation\u2014so it will need a pulley connection.\"\n\nI hope this clears up the matter somewhat. I asked Miss St. James if there were any arrangements financially and she said they had agreed to pay half the cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa Ontario Canada\nOttawa, 13th September, 1945.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 14th ultimo with reference to the washing machine for the Girls School at Spanish.\n\nIn my letter of March 24th to Father Primeau I advised him that we had provided an amount of $1,000.00 for repairs, improvements and the purchase of new equipment at Spanish Residential School. As far as our estimates are concerned, we consider both boys and girls schools at Spanish as one activity. Consequently any amount spent at the girls school would have to be taken from the amount mentioned above.\n\nLater on June 21st we advised him of the cost of purchasing a washing machine for the girls school and now note that the Principal of that institution would like the washing machine manufactured by the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company at a cost of $1,075.00.\n\nIt was previously stated that a reply to this letter was not received until we had your communication of August 14th.\n\nIn the meantime we have accepted all vouchers submitted by Father Primeau amounting to $749.29 leaving a credit balance of $250.71. Today I received your voucher for $145.60. This account will be paid but it will only leave an amount of $105.09. In the case of a Church-owned schools such as Spanish,\n\n..............2\nyou are only allowed by the Treasury Board to spend the amount actually provided in the appropriation and as stated above, this was $1,000.00. If we purchase the washing machine for the Girls School there would only be $105.09 to apply on this cost and the management of the Girls School would have to pay us the balance namely $969.91. Please consult the Principal of the Girls School in this matter and let me know her wishes.\n\nIf the present washing machine will last until next year, it may be possible to include the cost of the machine in our appropriation for the year 1946-47 but in that event the funds would not be available until April 1, 1946.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

He has let our man go for the present time.\n\nRegarding the matter of the washing machine, Miss St. James tells me that it is a risky proposition; the old one may break down at any time. All circumstances considered however, they will wait in the hope of funds being available from the appropriation for the year 1946-47.\n\nThanking you again for your enlightening letter on the matter,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev) J.R.

Last year the funds given for repairs and equipment should, I understand, have been put to that use. Through a mis-calculuation here this was not done and I am anxious that the mistake on our part be repaired.\n\nI suppose you have all the correspondence relative to this matter. The understanding was that the ladies were going to pay half the price of a machine made by the Beaver Laundry Company and valued at $1,075.00 dollars. If it is necessary to write in further detail of this matter will you please let me know? The machine has been kept running in a crude way but is beyond repair.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Rev) J.R. Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal\n\nMr Philip Phelan\nChief Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nOttawa, March 11, 1946.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the washing machine for the Girls' School at Spanish.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my letter of September 13, 1945. In the third paragraph you were advised that the Principal had expressed a desire for the washing machine manufactured by the Denver Laundry Machinery Company, at a cost of $1,075.00, and it was understood at that time that the Girls' School was prepared to pay part of the cost.\n\nWhen preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47, which commences on April 1, we were able to include an item of $700.00 towards the cost of this machine. It would therefore be necessary for the Girls' School to pay an amount of approximately $375.00 in the event of our purchasing the washing machine. We are prepared to proceed with placing the order if the Girls' School is willing to pay, approximately, the amount mentioned above. Please let me hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish Ontario\nMarch 12th, 1946.\n\nDear Mr Phelan;\n\nI have your letter of the 11th March in reference to the washing machine for the girls department of the Indian Residential Schools here. Miss St James, the principal wishes to thank the Department and to offer her agreement to the paying of $375.00 towards the purchase of the machine.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Rev.) J.R.Oliver S.J.\n\nMr Philip Phelan\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nDear Mr Phelan;\n\nI should be glad to know if the usual grant is to be given for the repairs and equipment for the schools here.\n\nFrom your letter I judge that there has been a special appropriation made for the washing machine.\n\nAs for repairs this year, you will perhaps recall that inquiries were made last year as to the insulating of the chapel here which is used by the boys for week day services and by the girls and boys for Sunday Services. The cost was entirely beyond our means even if the Department had paid the labour. We have been advised to lower the ceiling of our chapel several feet and have a pump installed on our hot water line. Our chapel is very cold in the winter and very uncomfortable for the children. Would you advise me as to whether we may hope for any help from the Department in this matter. In which case I could give more specific details as to what is to be done.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) W.H. Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nOttawa, March 15, 1946.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant and note that the management of the Girls' school is prepared to pay the amount over and above the sum allowed by the Department. For your information I may say that the allowance of $700.00 towards the cost of the washer is a special appropriation and does not affect the usual amount provided for the Spanish School. We expect to have the regular amount of $1,000.00 in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year. I note from the last paragraph of your letter that you are considering some repairs that are required.\n\nFollowing his recent inspection of the school, Mr. Doucet reported as follows:\n\n\"There is definitely a fire trap in this building. The furnace is situated immediately below the chain of stairs. Should a fire break out, this might result in trapping a certain number of students. The fire escapes built of metal poles would be of very little help in cold weather, especially for smaller children. An outside closed in stairway could, very easily, be provided at about $200.00. This stairway should be made of cement or cement blocks and should give exit to each floor. I would recommend that a night watchman be employed.\"\n\nI feel that it is most important that Mr. Doucet's recommendation receive first consideration, as I know you will agree that everything possible should be done to protect the lives of the children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nOttawa, March 15, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nOn April 26, 1945, you were furnished a requisition for a washing machine for the Spanish School. Later, you advised me that the following quotations had been received:\n\nJ.H. Connor & Son, Ottawa - $760.00 f.o.b., Ottawa\n\nBeaver Laundry Machinery Co., Ltd., Toronto - per J.L.G. Leacock, Ottawa - $1,075.00 f.o.b., Spanish\n\nCanadian Laundry Machinery Co., Ltd., Toronto - $1,110.00 f.o.b., Factory, Toronto.\n\nHowever, we were unable to proceed with the purchase, due to the fact that funds were not available.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 we have included an item of $700.00 towards the purchase of a washing machine and the management of the Spanish School is prepared to pay the balance. They would like to secure the machine manufactured by the Beaver Laundry Company, Toronto. I would appreciate it if you would ascertain from the Beaver Laundry Machine Company if they are prepared to supply the washer immediately following the first of April and, if so, at what price.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum: MR. PHELAN.\n\nRe: Inspection of North Bay, Spanish, Manitoulin Island, Shingwauk Home and Longlac.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nSPANISH GIRLS.\n\nThe great part of the children were down with the mumps. At the time of my visit, however, the school was back to normal again.\n\nThe school is very neat and in good repair. The children appear happy, healthy and satisfied. All the children are lovely singers.\n\nThe primary room is making good progress. The children love to read and are neat in their work. They do a great deal of dramatization; this is a great help for children who are learning a strange language. They know a large number of songs and they take delight in singing them. This class is under the direction of Miss Breau.\n\nThe intermediate class is under the direction of Miss S. Michel. She is not a qualified teacher. She is, however, sympathetic to the children and very conscientious in her work.\n\nThe senior room, under the direction of Miss Whelan is doing splendid work. The integrated system of education has been tried in this room. She has integrated silk, rayon, cotton and wool with history and social reforms. The children are in general, good readers and enjoy reading from the library books.\n\nThe sewing class is obtaining experience from repair work and the cutting and sewing of their own clothing. They do a great deal of knitting. A number of machines at this school are in bad shape and should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nAs J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nThere is definitely a fire trap in this building. The furnace is situated immediately below the chain of stairs. Should a fire break out this might result in trapping a certain number of students. The fire escapes built of metal poles would be of very little help in cold weather, especially for smaller children. An outside closed in stairway could, very easily be provided at about blocks and should give exit to each floor. I would recommend that a night watchman be employed.\n\nReverend Father Oliver, Principal, is very keen and has broad views on education. I would expect the school to make definite progress under his guidance.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nMemorandum: MR. PHILAN.\n\nRe: inspection of North Bay, Spanish, Manitoulin Island, Shingwauk Home and Longlac.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nSPANISH\n\nI believe the complaints re clothing, food and cleanliness are unfounded. The children seem happy, well-clothed and appear in good physical condition. The clothing misunderstanding appears to be caused by the actions of some parents. When parents visit their children, special articles of clothing are sometimes given. This induces some of the other pupils to write to their parents in order to obtain similar clothing. This evidently creates a bad impression on some of the Reserves.\n\nThe Principal seems to think that it would be better for the school to grant the discharge of these pupils. This, however, might create a bad precedent. I would then advise that the request for the discharge of these pupils be refused and that they should complete the term. I intrusted the Principal to notify this office immediately should there be any further trouble.\n\nThe primary room in this school is overcrowded. There are over sixty pupils. Grades one, two and three are in this division along with the beginners. In General, these pupils have very little, if any knowledge of the English language. This is an impossible task.\n\nThis school should have at least four classrooms. It is rather difficult for the Principal to organize another classroom due to the necessity of engaging another teacher. As conditions are at present, the Principal is having, I believe, a difficult time making his accounts balance. It is my belief, however, that something definite should be done to remedy this situation.\n\nThe Principal is endeavouring to obtain a qualified Manual Training teacher. He has one in mind, but has not yet received a definite answer from him. This would relieve the crowded situation to some extent. The situation should be studied now in view to improve conditions for next term.\n\nA new teacher has been engaged this year, but as he was sick, I was unable to meet him.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nOttawa, April 26, 1946.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th ultimo and my reply of the 15th ultimo, our Purchasing Branch has now received quotations on the washing machine required for the Girls' School and is prepared to place the order.\n\nIn a letter received from Father Prinsen dated April 23, 1945, the following statement was made: \"The present one is a Meyer Bros. Laundry Machine and is steam operated\".\n\nBefore finally placing the order, we would like to have your definite assurance that the statement quoted is absolutely correct. If there is provision in the Girls' School for the operation of the washing machine by steam, we can secure the machine at less cost than if it had to be operated in a different manner. I would appreciate receiving your reply by return mail.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.R.

(RG 10, Volume 6218, file 471-5, part 5)\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ontario.\nApril 27th 1946\n\nDear Mr Phelan;\n\nWith reference to your letter received this morning, the following statement, as quoted from Fr Primeau's letter dated April 23rd 1945, is correct. The present one is a Mayer Bros Laundry Machine and is operated by steam.\n\nThere is provision at the girls school for the operating of the washing machine by steam.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) J.R. Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Philip Phelan\nChief Training Staff,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ont.\nApril 30th 1946\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI notice from the files that in the past years the School here has been obtaining paint through the Department at a very reasonable price. This paint was obtained from Canadian Industries Limited, Paint and Varnish Division, II35 Beaver Hall Hill, Montreal.\n\nWe plan on doing the entire boys section this summer, classes dormitories and recreation hall. Would it be possible to obtain the paint through the Department again, making our cheque payable to the General Receiver? If so we should be pleased to have an order placed now for 100 gallons white interior gloss (enamel).\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Rev) J.R. Oliver, S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. P. Phelan\nChief Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ont.\nApril 30th 1946\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn reference to your letter of March 15th regarding the special appropriation for improvements and repairs.\n\nThe girls' section have proposed the following work which is very necessary at their school:\n\n1. The labour involved in glazing and painting 194 windows of various sizes.\n2. The labour involved in painting 16 rooms and repairing the plaster in same.\n\nThese two items will without doubt from the point of view of labor only, take care of the share of the appropriation allotted to the Girls' Department. The estimated cost of the work (excluding material) being approximately $500 dollars.\n\nAt the Boys' School we realize fully the fire hazard. We had planned on putting up a cement structure outside the building, which would serve as an ordinary stairway to dormitory, study hall and recreation hall, and prove at the same time a very practical fire escape. We had planned to pay part of the labor from the appropriation and to manage the materials from our ordinary grant. With prices soaring on such very vital equipment such as brooms and glass and with the possibility of everything going higher we are best to keep within our means. We have another fire escape of the stairs type which we shall have placed at the end of the building where we had planned to build the cement one. It will be the second escape for the main dormitory and will obviate the necessity of the younger children using the pole in winter. We ourselves regret that we cannot follow out the first plan which...\nfrom every point of view would have been far more practical.\n\nLast year the camp was partially completed but the outside of the buildings was not done. We shall have this work done this year. The same holds for the cannery; either ship lap or heavy braced paper will have to be used. Our green house is practically finished. It was necessary here due to the fact that such plants as tomatoes had to have an early start they are one of the main vegetables for the children throughout the winter.\n\nIf we may we should like to use our share of the appropriation for the finishing off of the jobs mentioned above, and for the installing of the fire escape also mentioned above.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Rev) J.R. Oliver, S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. P. Zhelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ontario\nApril 30th 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nFire equipment at both schools here is in far from perfect condition. Would it be possible to purchase hose through the intermediary of the Department for the schools?\n\nThis is an expense which will have to be met this summer very definitely. If there is any way you could help us we should be grateful.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) J.R. Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. P.

You sent me cheques as follows -\n\n$57.00  $179.80  $142.50\n\nMiss St. James forwarded me two cheques amounting to -\n\n$142.00  $174.80\n\nI was checking with the Treasury this morning and find that we have already paid all the accounts for the paint. I am, therefore, returning your cheques. I am also returning the two cheques of Miss St. James. If she sends me a cheque for $115.55 we will be able to pay the full amount of the cost of the washer, which was $474.80.\n\nThis leaves unpaid the account of $491.68 for extra labour. We can handle this as soon as the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 is available.\n\nIn view of the above I trust that the principal of the girls' school will forward me a cheque for $115.55 by return mail so that we can straighten out the books. The five cheques mentioned above are attached to this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. J.R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nSpanish Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1947.\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, cheques in payment of the accounts mentioned in your letter will reach you shortly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCanadian Industries Limited,\nAttention F.W.

The first estimate given us was around three thousand dollars. We had no choice but to give it to a contractor from the Sault working on a cost plus basis. If there were any chance of getting help in this matter we would be very grateful. The increased per capita will safely look after the \"up\" in the cost of living I think and the salaries demanded by federation teachers who are qualified. We are using the mill and electric shop and our power house for shop work but must fix up, and will, an equipped shop in the basement, the other places are not suitable in winter and for other various reasons.\n\nWould you please advise us as to any possibility of our getting any financial help in the pointing business...in any case we would appreciate knowing the balances left for each of the schools, and have permission to apply these balances as mentioned above...they for the painting and glazing we for the pointing of the house.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Rev) J.R.

Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch Ottawa\nOttawa, June 16th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 11th.\n\nIn our estimates this year we have included the sum of $1,000. for general repairs and painting at the Spanish Residential School.\n\nWe are prepared to recommend that this be expended in whatever manner you would wish. Therefore, we will expect to hear further from you as to repairs required at your school.\n\nThe other item included in our estimates was for $700. for laundry equipment. In view of the fact that this item was attended to in our last year's expenditures (purchase order 10566 of May 2, 1946) we could also use this amount to assist in repairs at the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nBFR/MGD\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish Ontario\nJuly 21st 1947\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 16th June and further reference to ours of the 11th, regarding repairs.\n\nFor the Boys Section the main repair this year is the pointing of the building which is progressing well. We should like to use our share of the grant for this.\n\nWe have begun the shop for the auto mechanics and electrical courses. It is being built in the basement with considerable expense involved. New lighting, three new walls painting etc.\n\nThe third item will be the construction of a new drive shed in a more suitable spot and sufficiently large to house all the farm instruments.\n\nI name the three items because we may have to apply for reclaim on one or the other depending on the stress at the time. I understand of course that the grant total is as specified in your letter to a total of $1700 dollars for both schools.\n\nThe Girls' Section wishes to glaze all the windows in the house and paint frames of same... they have two class rooms to paint and lavatories to paint and some plumbing to be done.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your letter sanctioning these repairs so that we may make out our first vouchers for reclaim.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) J.R. Oliver, S.J.\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Residential School,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, the amount of $1,700 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Spanish School. From this we were obliged to deduct the amount of $491.68 covering labour for painting in the girls' school. It was not found possible to pay this in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47.\n\nI understand from your letter that the accounts you will forward will be for labour and consequently we will be able to handle them. If material is required a requisition should be forwarded so that purchase can be made through our Purchasing Branch. As you will note, the balance available is $1,208.32.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nSpanish Indian Res.

I found the condition of this school excellent and the girls well mannered and very willing to speak out and show what they can do. The High School class is exceptionally good and several of them are interested in nursing and teaching careers.\n\nThe Principal of the school, Miss Z. St. James has been teaching Indians for forty-six years and has a keen appreciation of what can and what cannot be done with these pupils.\n\nThis building is definitely superior to that of the boys' section and has been well maintained by Miss Z. St. James and her predecessors.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. That the boys and girls should be sent to either the Provincial School at Massey or to North Bay for their Grade eleven when they have passed Grade Ten.\n\n2. That we investigate the possibility of finding foster homes on Manitoulin Island for children of seven and eight years old so as to allow for an increase in pupilage next year. These children could attend the local day schools and thus permit a certain number of High School pupils to remain for another year.\n\n3.

I observed four of them and found the boys very willing and interested in their work. Three of the teachers are qualified. As a result of the half day system with the older boys, the Achievement tests compared only fairly well. Now what this system has been abolished, more rapid progress should be made by this section of the school.\n\nFather Oliver is keenly interested in both the classroom and the extra-curricular activities of this school and is quite willing to have the boys now in Grade ten and eleven attend the Massey High School.\n\nBernard Z.

This would be nearly a thousand dollars and any grant given will be halved since the two sections are doing work which is necessary and vital.\n\nAt the Boys School we have had a good deal of repairs done in plumbing and this is the first year we have got through without continual complaints about the recreation hall toilet system and the connections from that place to the septic tank. The work is not finished but the good part of it is over. We have an unpaid bill of $230.70, of which materials amount to $236.50 and the labour $794.20, with Jas Solomon Plumbers Sudbury. We would like very much to be able to apply whatever the grant is to the labour part of this bill which is dated in the current year since some of the work was done after Christmas. This is an incredible bill for plumbing but these are incredible times. You may be well assured that we have no other big projects on for this year! The work done has been held over for years. I see some rather urgent letters in the files from the Department about the conditions formerly existing. Hope this can be arranged as it means a good deal to us. We would pay immediately and get that settled.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr P. Phelan\nChief, Training\nIndian Affairs Ottawa...\n\n(Rev) J.R.

The rolls of wire are 3' high and 100' long and sell at $15.00 per roll.

The school is well operated and has always maintained splendid herds to supply milk for the children. It would be appreciated if we could have your comments as to whether this is a fair charge against the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Spanish School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

The Girls School have another bill but are having difficulty with the account and may not have the vouchers in time. Theirs is for $85.00. The bill came and they have sent it back to be rechecked since there was some mistake in calculating the hours. There are no other reclaimable items at the Girls School since they got no other special jobs done, chiefly due to the price of material. If the following bills could be paid through the grant we could refund $65.00 dollars to them after we have received it and thus meet every repair reclaim of theirs this year. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Girls Dept. If this should be agreeable to the Department we shall send in the vouchered reclaim for these paid bills immediately upon receipt of approval and make the payment of the Girls School bill directly from our account. It does not seem difficult since the schools run as a unit on the repaired grant. I wish you to be assured that we notified early in the year as regards the grants and will do the same as soon as we have news after April 1st so that the Girls School may again have the opportunity of planning on the work. I think I have been correct in insisting that the Department does not pay for material for plumbing and repairs nor for other material except occasionally as in the case of big equipment such as the washing machines. The bills mentioned above that we would wish to submit for reclaim are Labor involved in installing radiators for heating mechanics and electric class in basement of boys school...$12.00. Installing of new hot water system in boys school...$14.00 Totaling $26.00.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMr. P. Phelan\nChief Education and Training\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nIndian Affairs.

J.R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nSpanish Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50 there was included a total amount of $5,000.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Spanish Residential School. However, there were two accounts held over from last year amounting in all to $581.48. This leaves a balance of $4,418.52.\n\nAs you are aware, there has only been made available half of our appropriation, and the balance of the appropriation will be voted when Parliament resumes its session in September.\n\nThere have been no definite instructions to the effect that we must only spend half of the amount at each school, and as many of the schools do not require their money until later in the year, we could possibly handle in your case the total amount mentioned above at any time. I suggest that you give the matter your consideration, and decide in what manner you wish the money spent. We would appreciate it if you would communicate with us before spending any money, as it is always easier for us to have expenditures approved before they are incurred.\n\n.....2\nI hope to spend a day or two with you before the end of the current month, and will advise you definitely of the date as soon as I can.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish Ontario\nJune 3rd 1949\n\nMr. P. Phelan\nChief, Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn reference to yours of June 2nd, the following improvements are planned for the Girls Dept. of the Residential School here and we would be grateful for the approval for these expenditures and their inclusion in the grant allowed for repairs etc.\n\n1. The repairing of the barn floors and of the coal shed labor approximately $350.00\n2. The painting of the walls and ceilings of three halls and two stairways.... Labor approximately $388.80\n\nThe total coming to $738.80.......\n\nThis work will begin as soon as we have approval for the expenditure.......\n\nWe thank you for the excellent help and continued interest in the schools.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Rev.) J.R. Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal...\nMr. P. Phelan  \nChief, Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn further reference to yours of June 2nd 1949, in which there is mention of a grant balance of $4,418.58, the half of which is now available to the schools here etc...\n\nWe notice that the sum seems to include \"purchase of new equipment\" and since we know that not all new equipment expenditures would be approved, (there was the case of the milking machines)...for reasons dictated by the policy to be followed in the Department, we would like to know about the possibility of help on the buying of a hay baler. We figure the price as around $2200.00 and would like if possible to apply $1000.00 dollars of the improvement grant to that purpose.\n\nThe farm is extensive and labor is difficult to get, and when you do get men the price is exorbitant for farm work. There are never more than one or two of the bigger boys left, we have two brothers who must handle all of the farm work in the summer, and during the month's camping, when we staff the Ayrd Island Camp fully and have the boys go there, the problem is still greater. We have to buy hay each year. With the baler we could buy the fields and do a quick and efficient job all round and the baler would pay for itself in three years. With a better farm better food. We got a tractor last year and it has already proved its worth. We shall be very anxious to hear from you in this regard since we should have to order early.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev) J.R. Oliver S.J.  \nPrincipal.......\n\nP.S.

We note that you would like $1,000.00 applied towards its cost. It would be understood, of course, that the school management would pay the balance.\n\nI am not certain if I can arrange this, but in any case, you might let me know exactly what type of machine is required, giving the catalogue number, etc. As soon as I have this information I will take the matter up with the Purchasing Branch.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nJune 14th, 1949.\n\nRev.

I sent my child to Spain without any regard, he will return here without a finger that will be missing all through his future life.\n\nI have no detail yet but he must be seriously wounded and if such is the case I will hold you responsible or the community for having sent my child to work in a dangerous position who might have imperiled his life. A child of less than 15 years on a sawing machine I suppose.\n\nHoping that you will hold a strict investigation as I am anxiously awaiting your report and information as to whether the boy is seriously wounded or finger completely off.

Marshall who came to Francis every two months. I asked the doctor to be satisfied with one dollar for the amalgam filling of Lawrence Canadian and twenty-five cents for the extraction of a first tooth of Lawrence Francis.

E. Boyd, Espanola, Ont., to perform the dental work absolutely urgent at the present time. The work should be done at the school. Owing to the extremely limited funds available for dental services, the total expenditure incurred for the treatment of the Spanish School must not exceed the sum of $200. Dr. Boyd will be allowed the same rates as previously paid him, viz.: $1.00 per amalgam filling; 50\u00a2 in the case of each extraction of permanent teeth; and 25\u00a2 for each extraction of first teeth. In the case of first teeth, no dental attention with the exception of extraction can be allowed. Dr. Boyd is to supply all materials and he will be allowed his actual travelling expenses. I would request that the new pupils entering the school receive first consideration by the dentist.\n\nPlease have Dr. Boyd prepare a list, in triplicate, on a medical account form, stating the name of each pupil receiving attention and the number of fillings and extractions in each case. You should also state thereon the mileage travelled by him and the amount charged, which must not exceed 7\u00a2 per mile. This account should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYou may arrange for the carrying out of the dental work absolutely urgent at the present time.

Mr. Solomon wrote me about it and I told him I could do it when I was up to the schools this spring. Rather many of the schools tells me the children do not need attention just now so I was glad to join up. What arrangements\n\nIndian Affairs.

Spanish is thirty-five miles from here by car.\n\nThe doctor says it's best all have to come out but I do not know how many there is.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nW.E. Boyd.\nMay 12th, 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDoctor Boyd has written to the effect that Mrs. Dave Solomon of Spanish is to have her teeth removed and that you have authority for this procedure. The Department would be pleased if you would see that this is done. Having only the name of this woman it is somewhat difficult to trace up the authority you have received, or the band she may belong to in a district where the Indians from many bands are mixed together.\n\nThe Department is prepared to pay for the removal of this woman's teeth, and will, apparently be asked upon to replace them by an artificial set. It is reluctant, however, to pay her expenses to go to the dentist, and does not wish to do so unless you find that there is no way of her going there by her own means.\n\nPerhaps you would be good enough to endorse Doctor Boyd's account in this case, and to enter upon it the name of the band to which the woman belongs. It should go to her Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nH. H. Harvie, Esq., M.D.,\nEspanola,\nOntario.\n\nIM.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of May 12/34 No 36-0-15D re Mrs. Dave Solomon. I received a letter dated Dec. 9/33 from Mr. Rothera authorizing extraction of her teeth by Dr. Boyd. She belongs to the Spanish River Band.\n\nI will be pleased to see that it is carried out with the understanding that if she comes to Espanola she will have her transportation expenses to pay. Her husband does occasional work on the Government road so I think she perhaps can pay her transportation.\n\nWill do as you suggest re Dr. Boyd's account. I may say in Mr. Rothera's letter of Dec. 9/33 he stated the Department would be unwilling to pay for artificial teeth but your letter indicates that perhaps you would if necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. H.

He had been confined in bed for two weeks on account of a severe cold. I was going to call Dr. Harvey from Esquimalt but as his temperature was normal I changed my mind. During the night temperature rose suddenly very high and the boy had great pain in his chest. The physician was up all the night. In the morning he seemed better again, fell into sleep, and unexpectedly while the physician was away a few minutes he died. The coroner sent by Dr. Harvey gave the verdict here enclosed. I wished to notify this morning. This is the reason why I did not send this sad news earlier.\n\nYours Truly,\nPaulin McLeod\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may find the requisition of rubbing alcohol a little too much but Dr. Harris thought that I need at least as much.\n\nThe department's conclusion that Indians prescribe for themselves is true to this extent that Dr. Harris lives so far and so much out of reach for those across the river, that he gives sometimes e.g., some cough medicine or liquid paraffin oil to a subject we know from a doctor's previous examination, wounded with appendicitis. If the department wants us to change our policy we will do so. Anyhow I have instructed the informer to give medicines in such cases in small quantities.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

He wrote me asking if he could pay a visit to the school early in January. I shall remind the Department that every two months Dr. Marshall comes to Spanish and we need him urgent cases. However Dr. Boyd's visit may prevent much trouble and therefore I endorse his letter here annexed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. Paul Mery S.J.\nOttawa, December 27, 1904.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Dr. W. H. Boyd, Spanish, Ont., regarding dental attention required by the pupils of the Spanish Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange with Dr. Boyd to perform the dental work absolutely urgent at the present time for the pupils at the Boys' and Girls' Schools. The Department will allow Dr. Boyd remuneration at the rate of $30 per day and reasonable travel expenses. The work should be performed at the school\u2014the dentist to supply all materials. It is considered that not more than 5 days' work should be necessary at this time. The Department is now paying dentists at a per diem rate instead of, as formerly, a fee for each extraction and filling.\n\nIt is expected that the dentist will devote full time to the work while at the school, and you should assist him in having the pupils ready for treatment, in order that there will be no delay in his work.\n\nThe dentist should prepare a list, showing the name of each pupil receiving treatment and the work performed in each case. He should also prepare an account for his services at the rate mentioned. The account, with the list of work done, should be handed to you, to be certified in the usual manner and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is noted that Dr. Boyd will be able to perform the dental work early in the new year. Our funds are extremely limited, and it is considered that five days should be sufficient to carry out all the work required by the pupils at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The girls have been examined recently by one of the departmental nurses, Miss B. Cousins, who finds that something in the neighbourhood of 100 fillings are likely to be required. She did not examine the boys, but I think it likely that 3 or 4 days' work will be required. The Department now allows a rate of $50.00 per day for clinic work of this nature, plus all out of pocket expenses.\n\nIt is intended that Miss Cousins should return to Spanish at an early date, and I hope it will be possible for you to conduct the clinic when she is there to assist.\n\nAt Serpent River Reserve, which is about 8 miles north of Spanish, there are 15 or 20 children requiring dental attention. The Department is willing to authorize a one-day clinic there, with the understanding that school children shall be given the preference but that adults in urgent need of dental service should receive attention if time allows on the day set for the clinic. Miss Cousins will arrange the clinic there with the cooperation of the school teacher. I would suggest Friday, October 25th, for the work at Serpent River, and October 26th, 27th and 28th for the residential schools at Spanish.\n\nW.E. Boyd, Esq., D.D.S.,\nEspanola,\nOntario.\nMiss Cousins is at present working in the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie. I am instructing her to arrange for a clinic at Serpent River at school on Friday, as soon as she hears from you. I presume you will be able to notify her not later than October 23rd, as to whether you will be able to undertake this work or not. Her address is - c/o Mr. Indian Agent Sims, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nIf you are not able to undertake this work mentioned above, please notify the Department at Ottawa and Miss Cousins at Sault Ste. Marie, immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary\nOctober 31st, 1935\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nFrom the report of Miss Cousins, the Departmental nurse who was recently assigned for duty at Spanish, I find that many of the pupils in the girls' school require dental attention. I have requested Doctor Boyd to arrange to do this work immediately and have suggested October 28-29-30. Miss Cousins has been instructed to return to Spanish to assist at this clinic and while she is there I think it would be of considerable benefit to have her examine the pupils of the boys' school. She will know whether they require dental attention or not.\n\nDoctor Boyd's accounts for services to pupils in the Spanish Residential Schools will be submitted through you in the regular way. The rate which is now allowed for clinic work is $30.00 per day, plus out of pocket expenses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L.

Gagnon\nOctober 26th, 1935\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am requesting Doctor Harvie to examine pupils of the Girls School who were reported by the nurse as having enlarged tonsils. It may be that some of these require operation, and possibly some of the boys require similar attention.\n\nMiss Moodie has mentioned the excellent infirmary accommodation at Spanish, and if there are a number of pupils requiring tonsillectomy this would seem to be a favourable time to have the work done as the Department is willing to assign Miss Beatrice Cousins for full time duty at the school for a few days and also to authorize Doctor Harvie to engage a nurse from Espanola if a tonsil clinic can be arranged at Spanish. Our suggestion is that Doctor Harvie's time should be conserved by Miss Cousins making the general examination and referring cases to him for his decision. She is a very competent nurse and a good organizer, and I feel that the clinic can be arranged without disturbing school routine for any pupils save the patients, and every effort would be made to avoid disturbance of the staff.\n\nDoctor Harvie and Miss Cousins are being requested to hold themselves in readiness to organize the suggested clinic if you have no objection. They will consult with you and Miss St. James and the final decision as to whether the clinic will be held at the Residential School or not rests with you. The suggested arrangement is, however, the only one for which funds are available at present.\n\nI wish to make it clear that it is not necessary to consult the Department further in this connection, as the work should done immediately, if at all, in order to take advantage of the fact that Miss Cousins is in your district.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend Father Mary,\nPrincipal, Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 2)\nOctober 26th, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the report of Nurse Cousins of her examination of the girls at Spanish Residential School, 5 are mentioned as having enlarged tonsils. She did not examine the boys at the time of her first visit, but it is likely that the same report could be made about at least as many of them.\n\nWill you please arrange to go to Spanish during the coming week, with a view to planning a tonsil clinic at the School if this is found to be necessary. It is expected that Miss Cousins will be on duty there the first three or four days of the week, as a dental clinic has been planned. We are not absolutely certain of the dates, as the details of arrangement were left to Doctor Boyd and Miss Cousins. I would suggest that you ascertain from the School authorities or Doctor Boyd when the dental work is completed, as we do not wish to impose on the good nature of the Principal by disorganizing his school routine too greatly.\n\nI have written Reverend Father M\u00e9ry, telling him that we wish to conserve your time by having Miss Cousins make the general examination of pupils and referring those requiring attention to you, on the occasion of your visit at the school. I have made it clear to him that the decision as to whether a clinic should be held at the school or not rests with him. The Department is\n\nH.H. Harvie, Esq., M.D.,\nEspanola\nOnt.\nwilling to assign Miss Cousins to full time duty for a few days, and is willing also to authorize you to engage a nurse from Espanola to remain at the School with Nurse Cousins for a few days if the clinic takes place. I presume Doctor Berry would give the anaesthetics, and it is desired that he or you should remain at the School over night as a precautionary measure.\n\nYou may not find that there are a sufficient number of pupils requiring tonsillectomy to justify the proposed clinic, in which case the idea may be dropped for the present as funds are not available to carry it out under other circumstances.\n\nOn the occasion of your preliminary visit in this connection, please examine all pupils reported as having sore eyes. Miss Cousins will be able to give you their names. I should also like to have a report from you regarding goitre in the Schools and the possibility of treatment.\n\nThe Department wishes to take advantage of Miss Cousins' presence in the district, and it is desirable that as much work as possible should be done not only for the pupils of the Residential Schools but for the Indians in all Reserves under your care.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 2)\nOctober 26th, 1935\n\nDear Miss Cousins:\n\nI enclose copies of letters to Reverend Father Mery and Doctor Harvie, outlining our suggestions as to a possible tonsil clinic to be held at the Residential School within the next week or two, if this can be suitably arranged. It is not intended that pupils should be sent to Hospital at Espanola without further authority from the Department, and if you find any difficulty in connection with arrangements for a clinic do not hesitate to write or wire Doctor Stone for instruction, or if you need any special supplies they will be sent you by express.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Presumably you have such supplies, and the Department would be pleased if you would furnish the quantity required for present use. You may charge this to the Department by sending a voucher or account to the principal of the Residential School, and see that the necessary drugs are included in the next requisition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

She is capable, diplomatic and untiring in her efforts and I believe her work will stimulate further cooperation interest and resultant good in the treatment of Indians. If it could be arranged that a girl of her type could visit and inspect the Reserves and School here annually, I am sure it would meet with fruitful results.

Harvie\nEspagnola, Ont.\n\nNovember 8, 1935\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have your letter of Oct. 26/35 No. 36-0-13D and carried out your requests.\n\nI visited the Spanish Residential School on Nov. 1st, and made arrangements for a tonsil clinic the following day Nov. 2nd. On Nov. 2nd we performed ten tonsillectomies on 6 boys & 4 girls in the Girls' Infirmary. There are still remaining about 35 cases that some day would be the better for being done. I remained at the School overnight as requested. In fact, I was at the School Nov. 1st, 2nd, 3rd., 6th, and 7th, so far this month.\n\nI examined 18 cases of sore eyes Miss Cousins had picked out and I believe found 8 positive cases of trachoma amongst the boys and 10 other suspicious ones and 6 suspicious ones amongst the girls. One boy had a particularly bad eye and I thought it better to isolate him from the rest to see how he responds to treatment and to await word from the Department as to whether you wish anything further done. His eye was discharging considerably, his lids were acutely congested and he had a history of possible trachoma in the family. We have instituted treatment for all eighteen. The boys' school does not seem to have the necessary supplies so I suggested they borrow sufficient from the Girls' School until the Department have time to send some to them.\n\nThere are about 50 cases of enlarged thyroid in each school and I have suggested that each school requisition for 5000 Sodium Iodide tablets on arrival of which we will commence treatment for them. Sometime ago I had the Girls' School requisition for them but the Department at that time replied that they did not supply them but I hope you will now.\n\nI would like to pass a few remarks re Miss Cousins'.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 2)\nNovember 5th, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere has been considerable discussion of the services and compensation of Doctors Harvie and Langlois at Espanola and Blind River respectively. Doctor Harvie receives a salary of $2000 per annum for attendance on the Spanish River and Serpent River Reserves and at the Indian Residential School. It is not found that he has rendered any accounts for extra services to these people but he has rendered some accounts for work done for Indians not belonging to any of these groups. Doctor Langlois receives $600 for attendance at Blind River and he has rendered many accounts for other Indians including some for those of Serpent River.\n\nIt was, without doubt, the Department's intention that the salaries paid these two doctors should cover all professional services rendered by them to Indians and the Department means to adhere to this intention both as regards accounts which may now be unpaid and as regards the future. Kindly communicate this information to the doctors concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nC.

On this she mentioned Hypodermic needles and syringes. It is believed that between the two schools there may be sufficient supplies of this kind on hand to last until larger regular order is sent in. I must say that the requisitions from your schools are often not very carefully made up and show little sign of examination by the medical officer. Such an item, for example as \"suture sundries and forceps\" gives little indication of what is required; in fact several items were deleted because it was not clear what was wanted and others such as Bicarbonate of Soda because it was scarcely thought the Department should be asked to supply it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Doctor W. E. Boyd of Espanola has always done the work. I have to inquire whether it will be in order to employ him again if funds can be found for the clinic.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 7th, 1937.\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 17th instant, it will be in order to re-employ Dr. W.E. Boyd, of Espanola, for dental clinic work at the Spanish Indian Residential School.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nSecretary.\nMay 13, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThis will be your authority to arrange for a dental clinic at the Spanish Indian Residential School. The work is to be offered to Doctor W. E. Boyd, of Espanola, and the fee allowed is $30.00 per day, the dentist to provide his own materials for extractions and simple fillings. A maximum of six days' work is authorized by this letter. If this does not nearly cover the requirements it might be possible to have another clinic in the fall. Probably you will not wish to have more than this number of days done at the present time.\n\nDoctor Boyd may be allowed actual return railway fare from Espanola to Spanish to compensate him for his outlay in travelling. It is assumed that he will be accommodated at the school without charge.\n\nHis account should be presented in the manner usual to doctors and dentists and on the correct stationery. It is not necessary that the account should contain the names of pupils treated but the number of fillings and extractions must be given. You will wish to keep a record of the work done for each pupil.\n\nThe Department anticipates that good work will be done and, from experience in other places, has come to expect rather a long day's work at these.\n\nRev. P. Nery\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School\nSpanish, Ont.\nclinics. Every effort should be made to organize the work in advance so that Doctor Boyd's time may not be taken up by examination of pupils who obviously require his services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R.

It is not prepared to authorize the clinic without these assurances. It would be wise for you to obtain them without too much delay in view of the early close of the school year.

Some of the cases are urgent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Howitt.\nOctober 13, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 9 can you make any estimate of the number of days dental work which would be required by the pupils of your schools. You might also say whether, as I assume, a dental clinic could be carried on at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nRev. J. Howitt\nPrincipal\nSpanish Indian Residential School\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nMP\nOctober 16, 1937.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 12th, file 36-0-13 I would say that two or three days dental work would be required. I say that because the department allowed for six days last spring. Cf file 36-0-13, date May 12th. When the work was done there were 105 extractions and 89 fillings. At present approximately 30 extractions and 24 fillings are necessary.\n\nThe clinic could be held at this school as in the past.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Howitt.\nOctober 19, 1937\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThis will be your authority for a maximum of 3 days dental clinic under the terms of the authority issued in the Department's letter of May 15, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nRev. J. Howitt,\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nLM\nNovember 12, 1937.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAll children in the villages about here have been inoculated for diphtheria, scarlet fever and small-pox. It is the general opinion that the boys and girls of the Indian School ought to be treated likewise.\n\nThe opinion is emphasized now that a neighbor's child has died and a report from Toronto shows that the cause of death was diphtheria.\n\nI would urge that our children be inoculated here as we are not prepared for an epidemic.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Howitt\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 2)\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 12th, I may say that the Department wishes as you do to avoid an outbreak of diphtheria at the school under your charge. You do not say, however, whether the proposed measure is inoculation with diphtheria antitoxin as a temporary measure, or treatment by toxoid as a permanent protection. The latter is preferable, for obvious reasons, if there is no apparent immediate danger.\n\nThis is a matter to be taken up with Doctor Harvie, but not for further correspondence. He will scarcely expect an additional fee for the work, and he can procure the necessary materials. If so asked, you may accept an account from the Provincial Government or other usual source of supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend J.

The present will last only until the 1st January. It is possible that we started giving it earlier than intended by the Department, but I must say that in spite of the wet fall the children have been singularly free of colds, due, according to our infirmary, to the daily spraying of the house with disinfectants and to the use of cod liver oil.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Your registration number must be quoted on the requisition for the School drug supplies. Why the Principal should have ordered rubbing alcohol from a firm in Toronto is not clear. Presumably it was because the item was struck out of his last requisition for lack of a permit number.\n\nSo that there may be no further difficulty, the Department is quite prepared to take care of the whole matter, if you will let me know what your permit number is. If then there should be any inquiry, there will be no difficulty in our explaining to the Department of National Revenue that supplies ordered for the school have no connection with the amounts purchased by you in your own practice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Howitt.\nOttawa, August 25, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn acknowledgment of your letter of the 20th instant, reporting the gravity of the illness of Isaac Thompson, I wish to state that the suggestion to send the body home, if the boy should die, has received sympathetic consideration. I have to point out, however, that it is not the practice of the Department to send bodies of Indians by rail excepting under very exceptional circumstances. Bodies so shipped have to be properly prepared by the undertakers for transshipment under the laws of the province, and the expense of a long journey, such as this would be, would entail an expenditure which the Department does not feel warranted in authorizing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

At that time his father died, and being an orphan, on his father's and mother's side, he has more or less lived the life of trying to make his own living, which he has succeeded to the best of his ability, staying most of these years in the United States of America; consequently has done what most of the Indians don't by looking after himself without the Department's help.\n\nHe is yet a poor man at that, and married in Los Angeles, Cal., and has been a sailor aboard steamships.

In 1930 your Department sent him to St. Peter Claver Indian School at Spanish, Ont., where he resided two years, or until July 1932, where he met with an accident, losing one whole finger and joint, the index in the right hand, while working in the saw mills. After being discharged from the hospital he was sent back home to Montreal, where his father placed a complaint, intending to see for damages.\n\nAt the time I understand your Department asked the father to hold this until the boy was fully of age, meaning the twenty-one year mark.\n\nYou had his visit last week, and according to his statement, you referred him to his own agency, to take this matter up from here. This man claims he is entitled to some damages, as it has lost a number of jobs for him, and wants you to allow him a decent amount at once, so he can move back to his wife and kids. I would be obliged, if you would give this letter quick consideration, and advise of your intentions.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 3)\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe have a few girls suffering from swollen tonsils, but one of them, Lila Thompson, is really in a very poor condition. Would it be permitted to send her to the hospital to be operated? Dr. Gibbon, Dr. Harris's assistant, saw her; he thinks as we do but says he is not permitted to do it.\n\nI also took upon myself to get glasses for Rose Frank, who is discharged though she is still here as we can't find her family. While she was in school all day she could put her book a few inches from her sight, but now we put her in the vocational class and she can hardly see a cup three feet from her.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nClotilde Laferriere\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 3)\nOctober 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received a letter, copy of which is enclosed, from the Principal of the Girls' Section of the Spanish Residential School.\n\nIt will be in order for you to arrange to have Lila Simpson attended to by the doctor, and if a tonsillectomy is necessary it may be proceeded with, that is, if permission is obtained from her parents or guardians.\n\nThe Principal mentions getting glasses for Rosie Frank. We are enclosing copy of our latest circular in this regard and in future we wish the instructions set forth therein followed. Under the circumstances, it seems apparent that Rosie Frank was badly in need of glasses and, therefore, in this instance we will authorize their purchase. Is there any possibility that the parents of this child might pay part of the expense of these glasses?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFor Secretary.\n\nR. P. G.

As Dr. Boyd remarks, it will save money to have him come to the school as there are fifty cases of emergency extractions in the convent alone. About the same number of boys have teeth that ache constantly or at intervals. It will cost money to have these pupils transported to Espanola.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Howitt.\nIndian Residential School  \nSpanish, Ont.  \nOct. 17th, 1941\n\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear sir;\n\nWe are again asking for the following articles and drugs. They were requested in June, 1941, but were never received. When Doctor Faulkner made his official visit this year, we informed him of this and he intimated that we should again make a request for them. We carefully explained to him our particular need of these items, herein listed.\n\n1- Head band & Mirror  \n1- Dental probe, R & L curve  \n1- Dental mirror  \n12- Rolls adhesive tape, 2 x 10  \n4- Bolts plain gauge  \n15- Cases of Thalattol or Cod Liver oil\n\nIt might be well to state again our need for these articles. The head band and mirror is needed to make preliminary examination of patient, before phoning doctor, who is residing 35 miles from the school. In all cases the doctor always tries to find out as much information as possible before deciding what is best to done to boy. Without the head band and mirror we are often at a lost to answer his questions.\n\nConcerning the dental instruments our difficulty is much\nIt is necessary for us to make the preliminary examination of the boys' teeth before making report to Dept. for visit of Dentist and moreover, we have to treat toothaches at the school. It would be impossible as well as very costly to have to run every boy with a toothache to the dentist, who lives 35 miles from the school.\n\nOur need for adhesive tape and guaze is also very great. This year we only received two rolls of 2 x 10 tape, which has already been used up. Last year we experienced the same difficulty and as a result we had to buy an addition supply. This year we have again bought an extra two rolls, which we last us for another month or two. We have also had to sew on all dressings or else tie them with sheeting. When we explained this to the Doctor, he informs us that the Dept. could buy this material cheaper than our school. Likewise for the guaze, we have to use a lot of this material, due to the fact that Indian children are often troubled with skin disease. This year's supply is about used up.\n\nThis year's supply of cod liver oil will last us only about 3\u00bd months. Rationing out the oil to 125 boys, a case lasts us from 8 to 10 days. To get good and lasting results from the oil for the year we should start now to issue it, but if we do so, we will have used our supply before the middle of the year. We should especially give oil to the boys in the Spring as well as Fall and half the winter months. But to do this we would need at least 15 more cases. Last year we had very good results from the little supply we had on hand. But we found out we started too late and had to stop too early in the year, to enable us to obtain the very best results and less sickness.\n\nHoping you will give this request your kindest consideration we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is sixteen years of age. She has had no correspondence from parents or relatives since her arrival, and we have no records as to her parents' home address, etc.\n\nShe has always seemed to be of a very morose disposition. Since September...\nFirst, she has become more and more troublesome, until it has become necessary to remove her from contact with the other children. She has shown excessive stubbornness for about two months, refusing to move when told to do so, to take her meals, retire to bed, etc. It is apparent that this condition is caused by some nervous disorder, as she does not sleep well at night, something most unusual for a child of her age.\n\nThis condition has gradually become worse, until today, when she showed signs of definite insanity, by tearing her clothing, the bed covering, etc.\n\nWill you kindly advise me, as to the wishes of the Department regarding her.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\u00c9lise Lafontaine\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MOORE\n\nRe: Rita Maracle\n\nI should appreciate your considering the attached letter which I have just received from the Principal of the Girls' School at Spanish, Ont., regarding the above-mentioned pupil.\n\nThe information on our files indicates that this girl was born in the year 1927. She was an illegitimate child of Percilla Maracle of the Tyendinaga Reserve and was adopted by Freeman Maracle and his wife. Freeman Maracle is also a member of the Tyendinaga Band. His wife died in the spring of 1932 and he deserted the child in August of that year. At that time she was placed in St. Mary's of the Lake Orphanage, Kingston, Ont., as the Indian Agent stated that she was a Catholic.\n\nShe remained there until July of 1940 at which time she was transferred to the Spanish Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMISS C LAFERRIERE  \nSPANISH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL  \nSPANISH ONT  \n\nDOCTOR HARVEY IS AWARE OF PROVINCIAL REGULATIONS REGARDING MENTAL CASES PLEASE CARRY OUT ANY INSTRUCTIONS HE GIVES REGARDING RITA MARACLE  \n\nR A HOEY  \n\nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDept.

However, any others that you think need glasses should be checked when the optician arrives and prescriptions forwarded here to be filled. The optician's account should be forwarded to Mr. Laurence in the usual manner and this letter quoted as the authority.\n\nPlease bear in mind the question of economy and confine the examinations to the children that obviously need it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

Approximately 57 extractions and 32 fillings are required in the boys' section, and in the girls', 61 extractions and 154 fillings. A clinic of at least four days will be necessary. Doctor Boyd says that three of the girls will have to be put to sleep before extractions can be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Howitt\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 3)\nMay 11, 1942\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt will be in order to arrange with Dr. Boyd to hold a dental clinic, not to exceed four days at the Spanish school. The Department will pay the usual $50 a day, the dentist to supply his own equipment and materials.\n\nIt is thought that the regular medical attendant of the school could probably arrange to be present when Doctor Boyd is holding the clinic so that he could give the anaesthetics where patients require them. It is also thought probable that the medical attendant could carry out a number of the extractions that are necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nRev. J.

I understand he suggested Sudbury.\n\nDoctor Hamill is going to operate on the tonsils of two of the children at the Girls' School this week. He will do the operations at Blind River. The two children are No. C1106 Lillian Solomon and No. C1147 Annie Corbiere.\n\nI have received the reports of the X-rays taken by the Travelling Ghost Clinic. They recommended hospitalization of one child, Agnes Solomon, but it apparently is an error as the child is quite alright\u2014Dr. Hamill examined her yesterday evening. I believe Dr. Hamill is writing in regard to this matter. The report recommends that one of the boys be re-x-rayed in six weeks\u2014the diagnosis was probable pneumonia at left base. It is recommended that another boy be re-x-rayed in 3-4 months, and that three of the girls and two of the boys be re-x-rayed in six months. Will you kindly advise your wishes in this regard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) G.A. Primeau, S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nP.E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nFebruary 9, 1943\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA recent report on the clinic held at Spanish Indian Residential School stated that Agnes Solomon had a discharging sinus in her hip and treatment was recommended at Eaton. I wonder if you could check up on this report as the school Principal advises that Doctor Hamill of Blind River, who is the attending physician, has examined the child again and there is, apparently, nothing wrong with her.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

Shorey, Esq., M.D.,\nClinician,\nDivision of Tuberculosis Prevention,\nDepartment of Health,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nLM\nFebruary 9, 1943\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt will be in order to send this child to Sudbury for treatment by a specialist. It would be well to advise either the hospital or Dr. McCullough the date that she will arrive so that there may be no undue delay in having her given the necessary attention.\n\nI am writing to the Ontario Division of Tuberculosis Prevention regarding Agnes Soloman as there seems to be some mistake regarding the report made.\n\nArrangements should be made to have the other pupils re-x-rayed on the dates suggested.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 3)\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario,\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is discouraging enough to be denied a regular medical attendant but when we are refused even the necessary medical supplies, the situation becomes impossible. The Medical Services know full well that we have no regular medical attendant and yet they do not even acknowledge our request of March 19th for necessary medical supplies. Apparently they do not appreciate even the effort we have made to carry on without a regular doctor\u2014or the effort we have made to keep down expenses\u2014a very discouraging attitude, to say the least. Let them try to take care of 126 active boys and see how far they can go without medical supplies. If they are not concerned about first aid and medical care for them, we are. And we are quite concerned that none of the children entrusted to our care die because of their not receiving proper care or care in time. If the Medical Services prefer to pay hospital bills, we are ready to send all sick to the hospital.\n\nThe Department authorized glasses for the children last year and finally sent the glasses\u2014without cases. Anyone would know how long glasses would remain unbroken if given to live boys without cases. The Department included a note with the glasses to the effect that cases could not be procured. I took the trouble to search around until I found an optician kind enough to let me have a dozen cases. The Department then refuse to pay for them because they\u2014the Department\u2014\"obtain and maintain a stock of them .... at 6\u00a2 each\". (Dr. Letter of W.L. Falconer, M.D., File 36-0-13, April 1, 1943.) Somehow it sounds rather contradictory to me.\n\nOne of the boys broke his glasses twice and had to have them repaired. The Department\u2014in the same letter mentioned above\u2014ask if this was authorized. Perhaps they will state whether their initial authorization for the child to wear glasses meant for him to wear them only until they were broken, or did the authorization mean that they considered that the child should wear glasses until the eye condition was corrected, if possible. The lad actually had about 10% vision in one eye and 30% in the other.\n\n(over)\nIn the same letter, the writer states that medical supplies are sent out from the Department for use in the dispensary. Their disregard of our request for supplies needed does not carry out this statement.\n\nThe Department authorized a Dental Clinic last Fall. Before the Clinic began, our infirmary was obliged to go to the hospital as a patient\u2014he was 17 days in the hospital\u2014due to a blood infection contracted while treating infected cases among the pupils. The Dental Clinic was during his stay in the hospital. I myself looked after the regular infirmary treatments and the sick during those 17 days\u2014and it saved the doctor more than one call. But I could not remain with the dentist all day long during his clinic which he held during that time. Someone had to assist. I called upon a nurse. I did not call upon the Department to pay for our infirmary's hospital expenses etc., though the infection was due to his devoting himself to the work of the Department. But I did submit a claim for the fee paid to the nurse. It was not allowed. Instead the reply abruptly demanded upon whose authority a nurse was hired! The more one does apparently, the less thanks one receives.\n\nI asked that something be done in regard to one of the pupils at the Girls' School, who appears to be somewhat mental. The writer in the same letter already referred to dismissed the request with a summary reply that the school term would soon be over and on her return to the Reserve at Gaughnawaga she could be examined by your medical officer there. At the time of writing, there still remained three months of the school term. And though the child originally came from Gaughnawaga, I mentioned in my letter that the mother of the child was in a mental institution. The child has no home there now. The father, I am told, is somewhere in the States. Gaughnawaga children never go back to the Reserve for the summer holidays\u2014they remain here until they are discharged by the Department and then return to the Reserve if they have a home and a suitable one. The Medical Services might give our requests credit for having been thought upon a little bit before being made and for taking into consideration various circumstances surrounding and affecting the individual cases.\n\nOur relations with the officers of the Welfare and Training Divisions have always been so cordial and pleasant and an encouragement to cooperation. It is with deepest regret that I write this letter in respect to our relations with the Medical Services. For two months I could not bring myself to discuss their letter of April 1st. But I can no longer hesitate to write as something must be done in regard to our medical situation, and the disregard of our request for supplies that are needed if we are to carry on. I leave the matter in your hands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Rev.) G.A. Primeau, S.J.,\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-13, part 3)\nBlind River Ont.

It probably would not agree with a Dentists anyway.\n\nThere has not been a Clinic since October 1941 so with the number of children I would expect a clinic to last at least three days and if he cannot finish up then another could be arranged for the Fall term.\n\nI have extracted teeth for some on some of my visits to the school and there is quite a bit of work to be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.C.

In my letter of March 24th, I mentioned that the first item on the invoice of March 10th was for one of the teachers and so was not included in the claim. We only claimed part ($3.40) of the receipted invoice for $4.40, dated March 10th, having already been reimbursed by one of the teachers for the first item on it. You will find that our addition of the amounts claimed is correct, as far as I can see. We do not wish to accept a second reimbursement for the first item on the March 10th invoice. In fact I would prefer you drop the matter altogether rather than have it be a cause of ill-will and dissension. One war at a time is sufficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.) C.A.

These glasses were supplied to Leonard on a prescription issued in October 1941 and it is just a question whether he would require lenses of the same strength at this time. His face probably has increased in size somewhat but, if not, the frame could again be used. Leonard was being discharged on June 30th and returning to Caughnawaga and it would be advisable to have his eyes examined to determine present requirements. The prescription may be forwarded to this office for filling and the glasses will be mailed to the patient in your care.\n\nW. L. Falconer, M.D.\nA/Assist.

Cross Jr., is making at least $75.00 per week as a steelworker and is considered well able to supply his son with glasses or have the actual pair repaired.\n\nWill you kindly forward me the glasses when I will interview the boy's father and explain him that he should take him to an oculist and have the eyes of his son tested.\n\n(Frs.

A Jesuit Father from Regina, now attached to the staff of Loyola College, Montreal, has been at the school for the past two months. He is experienced in the scout movement and has organized the work. Mr. Kisel will be the scout master.\n\nI consider this activity very valuable for the youth of our wards, and the Department intends to assist, as far as possible. Would it be convenient for one of the Ontario field executives to visit the school for the purpose of assisting the local management? The school is located at Spanish, on the mainland, north of Manitoulin Island.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Russell T. Ferrier]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. C.

As this is a school Troop rather than a community Troop, there will be no Troop Committee in the ordinary sense and we will also forego the payment of registration fees as we do in the case of other schools under Government control.\n\nWhen we receive the charter application back from you the document will be issued and sent to Spanish and registration certificates will be made out for the Scoutmaster and boys.\n\nWith every good wish, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPGI/HLA.\nAssistant Provincial Commissioner.\nOttawa, September 26, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Irwin:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with enclosure, concerning the formation of a new scout troop at the Spanish Indian Residential School.

Have it signed by the head of the school and then send it to us direct or through Mr. Russell Ferrier, who has also written to me re the situation at Spanish. Mr. Ferrier is a personal friend of mine and I feel quite sure that he can reach some agreement that will be satisfactory to you, to him and to us. As soon as the application is forwarded to us you may consider the Troop as registered and then order such badges and supplies as you require.\n\nWith every good wish, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Provincial Commissioner.\nMr Ferrier, B.A.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont\n\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nThe first patrol of Indian Boy Scouts has been organized in our school.

This, I hope, will be more convenient to you as well as to the Association.\n\nI trust that you will do your utmost to have these supplies sent soon.

They have had a good deal of fun and have a good understanding of Boy Scout ideals. The uniforms which you so graciously sent, were indeed a great boost and contributed greatly to create the fine spirit which is now in the troop. The results so far, are far ahead of our fondest hopes.\n\nWe are now training our recruits. Most of them are ready for the initial test. There are 29 of them. This will raise the number in the troop to 37 which is 5 more than Scout Headquarters advises. But the boys were so anxious to join that it was very difficult to draw the line at 32 and still be fair to the boys who wanted to join. However there will no doubt be some who will in time, not try to live up to the Scout Law so they will have to drop out, so that in the end the troop will consist of the regulation number of Scouts.\n\nI am enclosing an application for registration for the new boys and also a list of a few things we need. Would you please send these on to the Provincial Headquarters, Boy Scout Association, 330 Bay St.\n\nToronto.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-17, part 1)\nOur work during the winter will be mostly indoor work with a lot of drill on the qualifications for the Second Class Badge. We also expect that the Scouts will stage some kind of demonstration at the Christmas Entertainment in the school. In the spring we hope to work on a project, namely...a Scout Garden. If our plans are successful we shall have about half an acre of good garden land. My fellow teacher who will direct it, is an old and experienced farmer and we are looking forward to an A-1...Garden.\n\nSo you see, Mr Ferrier, the boys have made a creditable showing so far and if our plans for the year can be carried out we shall be able to show not only results of character building which are more or less intangible, but material results as well.\n\nTrusting that you will attend to our needs at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Scout Master)\nOttawa, December 7, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThis Department would be grateful if you would supply, for the use of the Boy Scout Troop at the Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ont.,\n\n4 Signalling Flags (semaphore - all blue)\n4 Signalling Flag Sticks\n1 Troop Record Book.\n\nThis equipment should be addressed to Charles J.

The Department wishes to congratulate you on the success which is rewarding your efforts. I believe it will be in order, in future, for you to deal direct with the Provincial and Dominion Headquarters of the Boy Scouts Association. I understand that applications for registration of scouts go to Toronto. Requisitions for all boy scout equipment, with the exception of the badges, is made to Dominion Headquarters, Ottawa. The buttonhole badges are secured from the Provincial Headquarters. You may inform either Provincial or Dominion Headquarters that the Department will accept responsibility for the expenses and that they should send you the account, in duplicate. You will then certify to it and forward it to me for payment.\n\nI am dealing with the enclosures this time. The application for registration of additional scouts is being sent to Mr. Frank S. Irwin, Assistant Commissioner, The Boy Scouts Association, 330 Bay St., Toronto, 2. I am also asking him for the buttonhole badges. I am requesting the Stores Department, Dominion Headquarters, Boy Scouts Association, 172 Wellington St., Ottawa, to send you signalling flags, flag sticks and a troop record book.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrie, B.A.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Boy Scout troop in our school now has thirty-six Scouts. Only nine of these have uniforms. Most of the others will have passed their second class tests soon and should have their uniforms when they do. Although you did tell me to order direct from the Scout Supply Depot, yet this order will be a rather heavy one so I thought that it would be better to have your approval before I did so. If the department sees the way clear to supply these uniforms, which I hope it does, I shall be pleased to send details &c., &c., &c.\n\nBoy Scout work has taken well here and the results so far have surpassed our fondest hopes. Those who have been away from\nthe school for several months, on coming back,\nnotice the difference in the boys and attribute\nit to Scouting.\n\nThe meetings themselves have improved. They\nare well conducted by the boys themselves.\nWe have just organized our Court of Honor.\nIt has not had an opportunity to do any\nwork yet but its future looks promising.\n\nI could tell of many incidents to show\nthat Scouting here has so far been a success.\nHowever I will not weary you with any more\ndetails or take up any more of your time.\n\nI sincerely hope that the department\nwill continue to give the movement the\nsplendid support which it has given\nin the past.\n\nKindly advise concerning uniforms\nas soon as possible.\n\nYour humble and obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-17, part 1)\nOttawa, April 30, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Kisiel:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, requesting a further supply of uniforms for the boy scout troop at the Spanish Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it is the usual practice for schools to purchase the uniforms. The Department, in order to encourage the taking up of scout work among the boys at the Spanish School, provided outfits for nine boys, but it is now hoped that the school authorities, themselves, will be able to provide the cost of any further uniforms for the additional number of scouts that may be enrolled in the troop. The Department is pleased to note that the boy scout work is meeting with continued success and that the boys at the Spanish School are interested in the scout work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Schools Branch\n\nRe - Spanish Schools for Boys and Girls (R/C) and Audit.\n\nYou will observe from the two audit reports hereunder that in lieu of salaries drawn, the members of the Sisterhood and Brotherhood of the respective Orders have clothing made from the general supply of clothing and material all of which is charged to the clothing expense item of the pupils.\n\nDonations and gifts are also made periodically to various institutions, these are in the form of cheques charged to the grant, and are apparently in lieu of salaries to the staff. From an accounting standpoint and for information of the Department such a procedure is misleading.\n\nNo accurate record is obtainable regarding the actual clothing cost of the pupils, and such clothing and donations etc., used in lieu of salaries should be recorded as salaries.\n\nThe same applies to dental and medical services for the staff, expenditures of which should be regarded as salaries and not charged to \"miscellaneous expense\" of the school.\n\nThe attached letter is drafted for your approval, and when sent to the Principals, Miss Z. St. James and Rev. P. Mery, it would be appreciated if a copy of your letter be supplied to this office for record purposes.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury\n\nIndian Affairs.

St. James,\nPrincipal, Spanish Indian Girls' School\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nA report has been received recently in connection with an audit of your school records by Mr. E. H. Berthe of the Treasury Branch.\n\nOne of the matters brought to our attention is that certain supplies of clothing and material, dental and medical services, donations to charity, Mass Offerings, and Xmas gifts, etc., are supplied to and paid for on behalf of the staff and charged to the general expense of \"clothing\" and \"miscellaneous\" in the school records. The explanation given is that such charges are in lieu of salaries, and the amounts are comparatively small.\n\nWe think you will agree that although the individual amounts of these charges may be small, they amount to a fairly substantial sum during the year, as it is noted that there are thirteen members of the staff listed as in receipt of no salary at the girls' school, and eleven members so classified in the boys' school.\n\nIn order to furnish the Department with more accurate information and to assist you in keeping your records from becoming misleading, you are requested to keep a record of the cost of all clothing, material and supplies furnished to the staff as well as the dental, medical and donations, etc., which are not a direct charge to the pupils of the school.\n\nThese items will be entered under the classification heading of \"Salaries\", and a notation made giving the nature of the charge and that it is in lieu of salary. In this way a more accurate accounting of salary expense will be obtained as well as of the other expenses which are a direct charge to the pupils or the operation of the school.\n\nYour co-operation and attention to this matter will be appreciated.\n\nHBR/B\nOttawa, October 16, 1935.\n\nRev.

The school property is owned by them.\n\nThe Principal Miss Z. St. James, and the bookkeeper Miss A. Gilbert gave me every assistance during my visit including access to all records.\n\nCash Book, Bank, Cheques, Invoices, Etc.\n\nThe cash book is the new synoptic type which has only been in use since April 1st, 1935. Prior to that date an ordinary single column type of cash book was used, no provisions being made to segregate items under appropriate headings.\n\nThe same condition exists as at the Boy's school in regard to invoices.\n\nThe bank account is kept at the Royal Bank of Canada, Blind River. A savings account is kept in addition to the current account.\n\nThe bank account is used for the school business only.\n\nAll payments are made by cheques with the exception of small petty cash payments. A petty cash advance is provided, but is not operated on the impress system. In future the petty cash will be balanced and reimbursed monthly.\n\nThe paid cheques were examined and checked to Cash Book. The cheques are properly numbered but stub record is not maintained. In future this will be attended to.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement #2.\n\nFor the period of one year, September 1st, 1934 to August 31st, 1935, the total receipts were $20,643.68. The\n\nH.J. Allen, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nper\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nper capita grant for the period amounted to $16,755.14.\n\nThe value of food produced has never been estimated in the past nor has it ever been shown in cash book. A record of quantities has been kept, however, as per statement No.3 attached. This was roughly estimated at $2500.00.\n\nThe revenue on account of laundry is shown as $900.00. This being a bookkeeping entry only, a contra entry had to be made for a like amount under expenditure.\n\nThe salaries amounted to $3066.80, being salaries paid to the lay members of the staff. The sisters do not draw any salaries. In lieu of salaries, however, they provide themselves with clothing and other necessities and these are charged to the per capita grant. The expenses in this connection are not kept separately, and could not be estimated. The total cost of clothing for the year is quite reasonable being $1501.23, a cost per pupil per year of $14.16.\n\nThe cost of food is considered high when estimated food value is included. The cost of food per pupil for the year is $53.64 based on both actual and estimated values of food, but it is $45.26 if the actual expenditures only are used and farm and garden products omitted.\n\nThere are no facilities for baking bread, consequently all the bread is purchased. The cost of bread for the year was approximately $1200.00.\n\nUnder the heading of \"Miscellaneous\" are included various items, such as medical and dental attentions to members of the Order, donations to charity, Mass offerings, Christmas gifts, etc. The reason given for such expenditures being charged to the per capita grant was that the sisters were not receiving any salaries and therefore had no funds available for such disbursements.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No. 4.\n\nThis statement is self-explanatory.\n\nThe number of pupils in attendance as at September 10th was 116, and the average for the year 106.\n\nLivestock and Crops.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 2 horses and 5 milch cows.\n\nThere are only 30 acres under cultivation.\n\nThe crops produced in 1934 are shown on statement No.3 attached.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were in excellent order, having been recorded neatly and accurately.\nThe bookkeeper is very pleased with the new cash book.\n\nA few suggestions were offered the Principal and the bookkeeper in regard to details which they seemed to appreciate.\n\nThe following statements are attached hereto:\n\nBank adjustment,\nStatement of Receipts and Expenditures,\nList of Farm and Garden Produce,\nCost of Operation,\nList of Staff.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.H.

Marie\nOntario.\n\nI submit herewith a report of an examination of the books and records of the above noted Residential School, covering a period of seventeen months, from April 1st, 1934 to August 31st, 1935.\n\nI arrived at the School at 10.00 a.m., September 7th - Saturday - worked that day until 5.00 p.m., and completed my examination at 8.15 p.m., September 10th.\n\nThere are two distinct Schools at this place, one for boys and one for girls.\n\nAlthough a combined yearly report is submitted to the Department, a separate set of books and records is kept at each school.\n\nI shall, therefore, deal with each school separately.\n\nSchool for Boys.\n\nThis school is conducted by the Jesuit Fathers. The buildings and the land are owned by the Jesuits, Upper Canada Province, Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Father Paul Mery, and the bookkeeper, Brother E. O'Keefe gave me every assistance during my examination, including access to all records and volunteered much information.\n\nRevenue - Cash Book - Cheques - Invoices and Bank, Etc.\n\nThe new Cash Book was only supplied last April and has been in use since then.\n\nIn addition a columnar type of cash book is being maintained. This book was the one in use prior to April and was adopted years ago by the Order of Jesuits for the convenience of submitting returns to the Provincial House of the Order.\n\nOn both sides of this book are columns which are peculiar for recording transactions affecting the religious order only, such as church collections, Mass Offerings, church goods and equipment, retreat expenses, etc.\n\nN.C. Allen, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Departmental Cash book, recently adopted, records only items of receipts and expenditures affecting the School.\n\nThe Bank account is kept at the Royal Bank of Canada, Blind River, some twenty-five miles from Spanish.\n\nA savings bank account is kept in addition to the current account. This account is used to deposit Government Grants, and funds are transferred to current account as needed. The reason for this account is to earn bank interest.\n\nI examined the invoices on hand. Many could not be found. In the past invoices were inclosed with the cheques when payments were made and many of these invoices were not returned receipted. I informed the Principal he should have a voucher to support every payment made and that it was unnecessary to forward invoices with the cheques. If firms insisted upon invoices being returned, they should supply a duplicate copy for that purpose.\n\nAll payments are made by cheques with the exception of small cash payments. The cash used for this purpose in the past was derived from sundry receipts. I advised the Principal to provide a petty cash Advance to be balanced and reimbursed monthly. This he is putting into effect immediately.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement 2.\n\nThe per capita Grant is received quarterly in one amount for both Schools. This is prorated according to the number of pupils in attendance at each school. During the period under review $34,145.95 was received and $16,755.14 of this amount was handed over to the girl's school.\n\nThe proceeds from Farm and garden produce sold was $247.46 which was derived from the Sale of poultry and eggs.\n\nThe item of $2,924.22, being the value of food consumed from the farm and Garden, is in my opinion fairly accurate. An actual record is kept of the produce supplied to the kitchen and the bookkeeper is advised of the value by memo. at the end of each month.\n\nThe laundry service is done by the girl's school. The charges are $900.00 per year. Ten months at $80.00, and two months at $50.00.\n\nIn turn the boy's school performs certain services for the girl's school, such as shoe repairs, electrical repairs, carpenter work. The boy's school operates the water and lighting plants and the girl's school is charged a share of the cost of operation.\n\nAt the end of each month the proper charges are made by bookkeeping entries in cash book, and a cheque is issued for the difference to the school that has the greater charge.\n\nThe two schools being distinct, as far as accounting is concerned, I would think that a better method would be for each school...\nschool to bill each other for the full amount, and cheques issued by each school. In this way the proper charges would be made and could be more easily followed by the Auditor. This matter was discussed with both Principals and they agreed that the present method was confusing even to themselves. They intend to try the method as outlined above.\n\nSalaries.\n\nThe members of this Order do not draw salaries. However, in lieu of salaries, certain donations are made to their Provincial House. During the period September 1st, 1934 to August 31st 1935 salaries paid to lay members of the Staff amounted to $1,201.75 and donations amounted to $1,791.44.\n\nClothing expenses appear exceptionally high being $42.89 per pupil for the year. The rough clothing and boots for the pupils are made at the institution. The working clothes for the brothers are also made and supplied by the school and add to the cost of clothing. A record has not been kept of such issues and the value could not be ascertained. According to the Principal such an expense would be very slight.\n\nInsurance premiums on the buildings and furnishings last year amounted to $692.95. This expense is included in the Buildings and Repairs expense item.\n\nThe cost of food is considered quite high. All the bread is purchased. The Principal believes it would cost more to bake than to purchase bread. He considers he is getting his bread very cheaply at 5 cents per loaf, and that the cost of installing suitable ovens and employing a baker would prove rather expensive.\n\nLivestock and Crops.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses, 13 milch cows, 1 bull, 17 young cattle and 500 poultry.\n\nThe crop produced in 1934 consisted of 40 tons of hay, 20 tons of corn, 1500 bushels of potatoes, 15 bushels of roots and 345 bushels of oats.\n\nThe hay crop last year was only about one third of requirements. Hay had to be purchased to the extent of $400.00. This year the hay crop was very good and there will be no need to purchase any of this commodity.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe new cash book is very much appreciated.

The vouchers and paid cheques were examined and checked to cash book, all of which were found to correspond correctly.\n\nThis year a voucher was on hand in support of every item of expenditure, a matter which was lacking last year.\n\nThe vouchers are filed in order of payment and bear the same number of cheque by which the payment is made. This has proved very convenient for reference purposes.\n\nAttached hereto as Statement No. 1, is cash and Bank Adjustment Statement, showing a Bank balance of $3,996.49 and a cash balance on hand of $133.42, making a total balance of $4,129.91 at August 31st, 1936.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement No. 2.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the Cash book and the vouchers.\n\nThe total receipts for the year amounted to $23,786.25 of which $18,317.64 was received from the Department covering per capita Grants.\n\nW. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nUnder Farm and Garden receipts is shown the amount of $3,605.31 which is the approximate value of the food produced and consumed at the school. In my opinion, this is fairly accurate as an actual record is kept of the produce supplied to the kitchen, and the bookkeeper is advised of the value by memorandum at the end of each month.\n\nThe proceeds from the Farm and Garden sold was $327.65 which was derived from the cash sale of eggs and poultry.\n\nThe amount of $692.92 is shown as received from the Girls' school during the year. This is for services performed by the boys' school, such as shoe repairs, electrical and carpenter work, and also the share of the operating cost of the lighting and water plant.\n\nRefunds from the Department of the cost of transportation of children to their home amounted to $371.81.\n\nA refund of $276.81 was also received from the Department for new shoe machinery purchased.\n\nGasoline tax refunded by the Provincial Government amounted to $173.10 of which $65.70 was paid to the Girls' school.\n\nExpenditures:\n\nThe expense under salaries amounted to $5,167.58 of which $1,167.58 was paid to lay members of the staff. The balance, viz: $4,000.00 was paid in lieu of salary into a special fund for the benefit of the religious members. I was informed by the Principal that this was in accordance with verbal arrangements with the Department. The total salary charge is slightly over 25% of the per capita grants and this is considered reasonable as compared with other schools of this size.\n\nThe clothing expenses shown as $1,698.40 is a big reduction over the previous year when the cost was $4,847.24. This is partly accounted for by a large quantity of goods being purchased last year for making clothes for the pupils and a large part of this stock was used only once or twice. Another element which had some result was that no clothing for the members of the school was purchased from School funds this last year. In previous years, as there were no other funds available for such purchases, the cost of such clothing was included in the School expense under the heading of clothing. Practically every article of wearing apparel and all the shoes are made at the school.\n\nThe cost of food purchased amounted to $4,652.17 and the value of food produced and consumed is shown as $3,605.31 for which there is a contra entry under receipts.\n\nThe miscellaneous charges amounted to $1,342.09\n\nI have detailed the more important charges under \"Miscellaneous\" - Statement No. 2. - The laundry is done by the Girls' school and the cost of such services, including mending, amounted to $983.60 for the year.\n\nCost\nCost of Operation - Statement No. 3.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on an expenditure of $23,134.45 which is the expenditure considered actually applicable to the running of the school. This is slightly higher than last year with the exception of clothing which is considerably lower.\n\nThe average attendance for the year was 118 pupils.\n\nThe average cost per pupil per day is shown as .53.56 cents while the amount allowed by the per capita grant was .42.41 cents. Included in the cost is the value of food produced and consumed which amounts to approximately .08 cents per pupil per day.\n\nList of Staff - Statement No. 4.\n\nThe staff presently employed is listed as per attached statement which shows the salaries paid to the lay members of the staff. Also $4,000.00 withdrawn in lieu of salary was on account of the members of the religious Order.\n\nLivestock and Crops.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses, 21 milch cows, 1 bull, 11 heads of young cattle and 1032 poultry.\n\nThe crop produced in 1935 consisted of 95 tons of hay, 400 bushels of oats, 20 tons of corn, 227 bags of potatoes and a quantity of vegetables the quantity of which could not be estimated.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe books and records are kept in an excellent condition. As far as I could ascertain, the church activities and its cost, also the private expenses in connection with the Order, are kept separate from the school cost.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy extended to me during my visit at the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.

The petty cash on hand was $44.48, and gave a net balance of $830.62 which agreed with cash book.\n\nAll debit entries were compared to pass book deposits and found correct.\n\nAll cheques were examined and compared to credit entries in cash book. Cheques were all numbered and attached to the corresponding paid vouchers. The vouchers were examined and with one or two exceptions were correctly allocated in the synoptic.\n\nThe petty cash purchases are recorded in a separate journal, are budgeted at the end of the month as to their respective columns in synoptic and cheque drawn to reimburse the cash to seventy-five dollars.\n\nA bank reconciliation is made every month, and the balance carried forward.\n\nRevenue and Expenditures\n\nThis statement was prepared from a recapitulation of the monthly synoptic. The total revenue during the nine month period amounted to $5439.50, with the per capita being $4645.00, and $525.00 from Department for the teaching of day students in the school.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $7244.12, and the salaries amount to 39%.\n\nThe cost of clothing and food at $17.24 and $41.47 per pupil per year are normal.\n\nL.W.

W. MacKey, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nEnclosure.\nNovember 26th, 1936.\n\nSpanish Indian Residential School for Girls\n\nRoman Catholic\n\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI submit herewith a report of an audit of the books and records at the above mentioned School, covering a period of one year from September 1st, 1935 to August 31st, 1936.\n\nI commenced my examination on the morning of November 10th and completed it on the 11th. I had completed my work at the boys' school on the 9th.\n\nCash Book, Bank, Invoices and cheques.\n\nThe cash book was examined in detail and the invoices and paid cheques were also examined and checked to cash book, all of which were found to correspond correctly. There were no missing vouchers this year, as was the case on my first visit last year.\n\nA bank adjustment statement was prepared, as per Statement No. 1, attached, showing a bank balance of $4,977.11, and a cash balance on hand as $208.43, making a total balance of $5,185.54 at August 31st, 1936.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement No. 2.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the cash book and vouchers.\n\nThe total receipts for the year amounted to $21,639.49, of which $17,240.12 was received from the Department covering per capita Grants.\n\nThe proceeds from Farm and Garden cash sales only amount to $25.90, which was received from the Farm Manager. The estimated value of the food produced and consumed at the School is shown as $2,175.00, which was only roughly estimated. A record of the produce supplied to the kitchen was kept but no value was placed on such food at the time of delivery.\n\nJ.W. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nThe sum of $1,202.32 was received from the Boys' School during the year. $983.60 of this amount was for laundry and mending and the balance was on account of coal which was purchased by this school and part of the car was for the Boys' School.\n\nTransportation refund amounted to $44.75. Interest on Savings amounted to $29.50. Gasoline tax refunds from the Provincial Government amounted to $65.70, which amount was received through the Boys' School. Sundry refunds which amounted to $255.17 were mostly on account of goods which were returned and refunds obtained.\n\nExpenditure:\n\nThe total salary charges amounted to $3,593.79 of which $2,782.85 was paid to lay members of the staff. The balance, viz: $810.94 was paid from school funds, in lieu of salary, for the following purchases and services for the benefit of the members of the Order of Sisters.\n\n| Item                  | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Hospitals             | $235.00  |\n| Clothing              | 206.77   |\n| Transportation        | 164.45   |\n| Dental                | 87.33    |\n| Furniture & Freight   | 62.72    |\n| Drugs                 | 29.08    |\n| Newspapers & Miscellaneous | 15.59 |\n| Doctors               | 10.00    |\n\n$810.94\n\nThis was in accordance with instructions received from the Department - Letter of October 16th, 1935.\n\nThe total salary charge is slightly over 20% of the per capita grants and this is considered most reasonable. The Principal is satisfied with this arrangement.\n\nThe expenses in connection with fuel, light, and water, are greater than the previous year by $1,113.18. In former years the charges for light and water were not fully recorded. The plants for the supply of light and water are operated by the Boys' School and last year the Girls' School has been fully charged with its share of the cost of operation.\n\nThe charges under miscellaneous have been itemized as far as possible. Numerous small payments have been made from petty cash and when reimbursements were made many of the charges were shown under miscellaneous.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No. 3.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on an expenditure of $19,521.87, which is the expenditure considered actually applicable to the running of the school. This is slightly less than the previous year and this is partly due to the higher average attendance during the year under review. The average attendance for the year was 117.6 pupils.\n\nThe average cost per pupil per day is shown as .45.35 cents while the amount allowed by the per capita grants\nwas .4144 cents. Included in the cost is the value of food produced and consumed which amounts to approximately .05 cents per pupil per day.\n\nList of Staff - Statement No. 4.\n\nThe staff presently employed is listed as per statement No. 4, attached, which shows the rate of salaries paid to the lay members of the staff.\n\nThe members of the Order of Sisters do not draw salary but certain expenses, in lieu of salary, are paid from the school funds.\n\nLivestock and Crops.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 2 horses, 7 cows and 118 hens.\n\nThe crop produced in 1935 consisted of 7 tons of hay, 160 bushels of oats, 225 bags of potatoes and 66 bushels of roots.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were found in very good order and neatly kept.\n\nThe few suggestions offered last year were well followed and a better record was available this year.\n\nI was afforded every assistance by the Principal and the bookkeeper during the course of my visit at the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.H.

The per capita grants received amounted to $18,949.35. Farm and Garden cash sales amounted to $2.75 only and covered the sale of hides.\n\nThe receipts from other sources totalled $1,812.91. These are summarized on the attached statement.\n\nExpenditures\n\nThe total disbursements during the period amounted to $25,967.04, in which is included the value of food raised and consumed.\n\nL. W. McOutecheon, Esq.,\nActing Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nIn order to save many explanations covering the expenditure under each heading, statement No. 2A was prepared and it shows in detail the most important items.\n\nI understand it was agreed between the Department and the school to withdraw $4,000.00 from School funds each year to cover salaries of the religious members of the school staff. Last year only $1,600.00 was withdrawn for this purpose as it was felt that the school funds could not stand a larger amount being withdrawn.\n\nConsiderable repairs to the buildings were attended to during the year especially to the plumbing. It was estimated that the plumbing material cost $1,019.28 and the labour - under extra labour - amounted to $636.35.\n\nNew water tanks had to be purchased this year. The cost for such tanks is shown as $421.50, but $255.00 was refunded by the Girls' School to cover their share.\n\nThe expenditure on account of the Farm and Garden amounted to $1,161.47 as compared with $1,815.29 last year.\n\nThe miscellaneous charges amounted to $1,452.44. I have detailed a few items on statement 2A, but owing to want of space on the statement, I shall detail here the item \"Sundry\":\n\n| Item                                      | Amount |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Girls' School share of Gas Tax rebate from Provincial Government | $4.00  |\n| Sports                                    | $20.71 |\n| Christmas Gifts                           | $30.00 |\n| Fertilizer for Girls' School              | $53.19 |\n| Flashlight bulbs                          | $5.76  |\n| Unclassified                              | $63.45 |\n\nDuring the year the sum of $280.39 was expended to purchase fishing nets. These nets were handed over to a local white fisherman who was supposed to supply the school with fish as required, thereby paying for the nets. During the year only some $48.00 worth of fish was delivered. This arrangement was made by the former Principal, Father Mery, and it has not worked as satisfactorily as anticipated. I advised the Principal to get in touch with this fisherman and try to arrive at some understanding on the matter.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No. 3.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on an expenditure of $25,967.04 which is considered applicable to the operation of the school. There is very little difference in the cost over last year.\n\nIncluded in the cost is the value of the food raised and consumed which amounts to approximately .09 cents per pupil per day.\n\nThe average attendance for the year was 124.7 pupils.\n\nList...\nList of Staff - Statement No. 4\n\nThe staff presently employed is listed as per attached statement. The annual salaries, if paid, would amount to $5,620.00.\n\nLivestock and Crops\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses, 19 cows, 1 bull, 15 young cattle and 550 poultry.\n\nThe crop produced in 1937, according to records, consisted of 51 tons of hay, 15 tons of green oats, 450 bushels of oats, 95 bushels of barley, 675 bags of potatoes, 157 bags of roots and 30 tons of silage corn. There was also a quantity of garden produce, the value of which was estimated at $396.50.\n\nA record was kept in the kitchen of the food produced and consumed and the value was estimated as follows:\n\n| Item               | Value   |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Milk and cream     | $2,041.50 |\n| Eggs and chicken   | $660.70  |\n| Meat               | $375.21  |\n| Butter             | $144.09  |\n| Potatoes           | $675.00  |\n| Other vegetables   | $396.50  |\n\n$4,103.00\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records were found in good condition and recorded up to date.\n\nAs far as I could ascertain the church activities and its cost, also the private expenses in connection with the Order, are not included in the operating cost of the School.\n\nBoth the Principal, Rev. J. Howitt, and the bookkeeper, Brother O'Keefe, co-operated with me and they assisted me in every way.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.H.

Cash on hand amounted to $75.00; therefore the actual balance was $7,336.14 which agreed with the cash book balance.\n\nThe paid cheques and the paid vouchers were available and these were examined and checked to the cash book. The postings in the cash book appeared to be correctly recorded with the exception of an expense of $255.00, covering renewal of water tanks, which was charged to water expense instead of buildings and repairs. The correction was brought to the attention of the book-keeper.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement No. 2.\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the cash book after my examination of the paid cheques and vouchers.\n\nThe total receipts for the year are shown as $22,772.00 in which is included the value of the food produced and consumed at the school.

A new ice house was built at a cost of $1,151.00. Painting of the exterior wood work of the building cost $600.00, and replacements of water tanks show an expenditure of $255.00.\n\nThe total expenditure for the year is shown as $1,994.23 higher than the previous year. If the value of the food produced and consumed were left out of each year the increase in the actual disbursement would be $1,590.15.\n\nThe school, with a balance of $7,336.14 at August 31, 1938, is in an excellent financial condition.\n\nCost\nCost of Operation - Statement No.3.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on expenditure of $22,049.39 which is considered applicable to the running of the school.\n\nThere is a slight increase over last year except in the cost of clothing which is a little less.\n\nThe average cost per pupil for the year is shown as $177.12 while the amount allowed by the per capita grants was $150.70 per pupil.

This school was not visited by an auditor during 1939.\n\nI commenced my examination at 2.00 p.m., August 19th, and completed it at 5.00 p.m., August 21st.\n\nThe bookkeeper had been away on vacation for a couple of weeks and he returned only on August 20th. The cash book, therefore, had not been written up for August.\n\nCash Book, Vouchers, Cheques, Etc.\n\nAccording to bank pass books there was a balance of $3,790.70 in the bank at July 31st. Unpresented cheques totalled $31.32, leaving a net bank balance of $3,759.38. The petty cash account was overdrawn $4.01, therefore, the actual balance was $3,754.37 which agreed with the cash book. \u2014 Statement No.1.\n\nThe paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book entries. The vouchers were on hand and they were examined by test.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures \u2014 Statement No.2.\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of synoptic cash book after I had completed my examination of the cheques and vouchers. Several adjustments had to be made in the allocation of the charges under several headings, and I have taken these into account when preparing this statement.\n\nReceipts\n\nThe total receipts during the twenty-three months under review amounted to $52,122.42, in which is included the amount of $7,310.78, which represents the value of the food raised and consumed at the school. This amount is also shown as \"contra\" under expenditures...\n\nMcCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nexpenditures. The per capita grants received totalled $58,990.30, and cover grants for two complete years.\n\nThe farm and garden cash sales, amounting to $511.43, included the following:\n\n- Chicks - $246.03\n- Eggs - $142.94\n- Cows (2) - $105.00\n- Cow hides - $7.36\n- Milk and cream - $5.85\n- Fertiliser - $4.25\n\n$511.43\n\nIncluded in the receipts under \"Other Sources\" is an item of $2,071.57, which represents the amount paid by the Girls' School for shoe repairs, the share of Gas and Oil used at the Light and Water plant, and other services performed by the Boys' School, during the period. The other items are listed in Statement No.2 and are self-explanatory.\n\nExpenditures:\n\nThe total disbursements during the same period amounted to $51,477.99, in which is included as \"contra\" the value of the food raised and consumed at the school.\n\nI have prepared Statement No.2A, in which is shown more in detail the most important items of expenditure, thereby saving many explanations.\n\nA Diesel Engine was purchased early this year at a cost of $1,375.92 and half of the cost viz: $687.96, was paid by Girls' School. This is to replace a gasoline engine which was in use at the Light and Water plant, which was about worn out. According to the Principal the cost of operating a Diesel engine will be much lower than that of a gasoline engine as a cheaper grade of fuel oil is used.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.3.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on an expenditure of $51,477.99 less refunds and cash sales amounting in all to $5,321.44. There is very little difference in the cost as compared with two years ago.\n\nIncluded in the cost is the value of the food raised and consumed which amounts to approximately .09 cents per pupil per day.\n\nThe average attendance during the period was 126.861 pupils.\n\nStaff - Statement No.4\n\nThe Staff presently employed is listed as per attached statement. The annual salaries, if paid would amount to $2,500.00. It had been the intention of the Board to withdraw $4,000.00 per year to cover the salaries of the religious members of the staff, but the withdrawals during the past three years have averaged only $2,500.00 per annum.\n\nLivestock...\nLivestock and Crops\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses, 20 cows, 1 bull, 8 heifers, 7 calves and 250 hens.\n\nThe farm consists of approximately 140 acres of arable land. Apart from this there is considerable pasture and wood land.\n\nThe crop produced in 1939, according to school records, consisted of 100 tons of hay, 300 bushels of oats, 40 bushels of barley, 149 bags of potatoes, 8 tons of ensilage corn and 147 bags of roots. There was also a quantity of garden produce, the value of which was estimated at $536.20.\n\nA record was kept in the kitchen of the food produced and consumed during the 23 months under review and the value was estimated as follows:\n\n| Item               | Value   |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Milk and cream     | $3,920.05 |\n| Eggs and chickens  | $1,329.60 |\n| Butter             | $704.24  |\n| Veal               | $200.30  |\n| Beef               | $157.34  |\n| Cheese             | $13.05   |\n| Potatoes           | $556.00  |\n| Other vegetables   | $930.20  |\n\nTotal: $7,610.78\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were found in good order and recorded up to July 31st, 1940.\n\nAs far as I could ascertain the church cost and the private expenses, in connection with the religious order, are not included in the operating cost of the school.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by both Rev.

Cash on hand amounted to $75.00, therefore the actual balance was $5,982.77, which agreed with the cash book.\n\nThe paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book. Most of the vouchers were available and these were checked by test. With very few exceptions the postings appeared to be properly allocated under the various headings of expenditures in the cash book.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement No.2\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the synoptic cash book after the necessary adjustments had been taken into account.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the period under review are shown as $46,502.96 in which is included the value of the food produced on the farm and garden and consumed at the school. The Government per capita grants received during the year, covering two full years, amounted to $38,442.78.\n\nThe proceeds from Farm and Garden cash sales amounted to $36.57 only and cover the sale of milk to the farmer.\n\nW. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nThe estimated value of food produced on the farm and garden and consumed at the school is shown as $4,917.26. A record was kept of the produce supplied to the kitchen and the local market value was placed on such food at the time of delivery.\n\nThe records showed that the following had been received in the kitchen:\n\n| Item     | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Value |\n|----------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Milk     | 27651 Qts.| @ 10\u00a2      | $2,765.10   |\n| Eggs     | 1102 Doz.| @ 35\u00a2      | $385.70     |\n|          | 741      | @ 30\u00a2      | $222.30     |\n| Beef     | 1485 lbs.| @ 11\u00a2      | $163.55     |\n|          | 393      | @ 10\u00a2      | $39.30      |\n| Veal     | 104      | @ 14\u00a2      | $14.56      |\n| Potatoes | 65       | @ 1.25     | $81.25      |\n| Vegetables| 261     | @ .30      | $78.30      |\n\nVegetables valued at $1,020.90\n\n$4,917.26\n\nThe receipts from other sources are itemized on the statement and are self-explanatory. During the period the school sold groceries and other supplies to the farmer and collections for these articles were made from monthly salaries.\n\nExpenditures:\n\nThe total expenditures during the same period amounted to $7,856.33 in which is included as \"contra\" the value of food raised on the farm and garden and consumed at the school.\n\nI have prepared Statement No.2A, which shows more in detail the most important items of expenditures under each heading.\n\nUnder the heading \"Phone, Fuel, Light and Water\" is an item of $687.96 which is the half share paid by this school for a Diesel Engine purchased for use in the Light and Water plant. The other half was paid by the Boys School.\n\nConsiderable repairs and replacements were made for which expenditures are shown under \"Buildings and Repairs\". A new high pressure boiler was purchased and installed for use in the laundry at a cost of $1,285.94. Alterations and additions to the plumbing cost $1,165.41 for material and $701.15 for wages of the plumbers. All the showers were equipped with metal strippings at a cost of $689.00. Other repairs were of a minor nature.\n\nThe expenditure under \"House Equipment\" were about normal with the exception of $601.05 for Insurance on buildings and contents.\n\nI have itemized the items under \"Miscellaneous\" as much as I could.\n\nThe .....\nThe School, with a balance of $5,982.77 at August 16th, 1940, is in an excellent financial condition.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.3\n\nThe cost of operation is based on the amount of $44,187.87, which represents the net expenditure for twenty-three months ending July 31st, 1940. In order to arrive at this amount, I have deducted from the actual expenditure of $47,856.33, shown on Statement No.2, the disbursements of $285.44, made during August, 1940, and the total receipts of $3,142.92, received during the period under review.\n\nThere is a very slight increase in the cost of operation over the cost shown two years ago.\n\nThe average cost per pupil per year is shown as $154.29 whilst the amount allowed by the per capita grants was $152.65 per pupil. Included in the cost is the estimated value of the food raised and consumed which amounts to $20.51 per pupil per year.\n\nStaff\n\nThe staff presently employed is listed on Statement No.4 and the annual salaries payable are shown as $5,120.00. The average yearly grants received during the past two years amounted to $19,221.39, therefore the salaries are 26.6% of the grants.\n\nLivestock and Crop:\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 2 horses, 6 cows and 100 pullets.\n\nThe land available for farming consists of 25 acres only.\n\nThe crop produced in 1939 included 9 tons of hay, 86 bushels of oats, 3/4 tons of turnips and mangels and 65 bags of potatoes. There was also a quantity of garden produce the value of which was estimated at $530.30.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were found to be neatly and accurately kept.\n\nThe school buildings appeared to be in a good state of repair and they present a neat appearance.\n\nThe bookkeeping is handled by the same person, Miss Gilbert, and she appears to handle her work very efficiently.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by both Misses Laferriere and Gilbert during the course of my visit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.H.

A certain amount of painting was also undertaken.\n\nThe disbursements under the other headings are about normal.\n\nThis School appears to be operated very economically and with a balance of $7,602.97 at August 16th, 1941, is in a very sound financial condition.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.4.\n\nThe cost of operation for the year is based on a net cost of $20,163.81.

There was no grain nor hay harvested this year. The potato crop brought 151 bags. There was also four tons of mangels and turnips used for feed. The garden provides considerable food each year.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were found to be very well kept and up to date.\n\nA Miss Gilbert is the bookkeeper and she appears to keep the records accurately.\n\nThe foregoing, to the best of my knowledge and belief and from the vouchers and records which have been placed at my disposal, is a true and complete statement of the condition of the accounts at the time of my audit.

Berthe  \nAuditor.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nOttawa, November 20th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSpanish Indian Residential School for Boys\nRoman Catholic\nSpanish, Ontario\n\nI submit herewith a report of an audit of the books and records at the above noted Residential School, covering a period of twelve months, from August 1st, 1940 to July 31st, 1941.\n\nI commenced my examination on the morning of August 18th, and completed it at noon the next day.\n\nCash Book, Vouchers, Cheques, Etc.\n\nThe bank accounts are kept with the Royal Bank of Canada, Blind River, some thirty-five miles from Spanish. Two bank accounts are maintained, one in savings and the other is a current account on which the cheques are drawn. According to the bank pass books, which were written up to July 31st, the combined balance at that date was $3,440.69, against which two cheques amounting to $106.08 were found to be outstanding, leaving a net bank balance of $3,334.61. The petty cash account was overdrawn $6.68, therefore, the actual balance was $3,327.93, which agreed with the cash book - Statement No.1.\n\nThe paid cheques were available, and these were examined and checked to the cash book. The vouchers were on hand and they were examined by test and the allocations were checked to the cash book.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement No.2.\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the synoptic cash book after I had completed my examination of the cheques and the vouchers.\n\nReceipts\n\nThe total receipts during the twelve months under review amounted to $24,865.56, in which is included the amount of $4,492.56, representing the value of the food raised and consumed at the school. This amount is shown also as \"contra\" under expenditures. The per capita grants received during the period amounted to $13,362.03, in which is included $800.00 additional grant of grants for a previous period. The cheque for $1,600.00 was received in December, 1940, and according to the slip inclosed with the cheque, it represented supernumerary grant for 10 pupils. One half of the amount, $800.00, was given to the Girls' School.\n\nW. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nThe farm and garden cash sales, amounting to $106.45, included the following:\n\n- 2 old horses: $100.00\n- 1 calf: $4.00\n- Milk: $1.60\n- Hides: $35\n\n$106.45\n\nIncluded in the receipts under \"Other Sources\" is an item of $52.20, which represents an amount received from the Girls' School for shoe repairs, the share of gas and oil used at the light and water plant, and other services performed by the Boys' School during the period. The other items are listed on Statement No.2 and are self-explanatory.\n\nExpenditure:\n\nThe total expenditure during the same period amounted to $25,294.50, in which is included as \"contra\" the value of the food raised and consumed at the School.\n\nI have prepared statement No.3 on which are detailed the most important items of expenditure.\n\nThe Jesuit Order has installed a grist mill and a bakery on their property to supply the bread to the School. The cost of purchase and operation of the mill and bakery was financed by the Order. Both have been in operation since early in June this year. According to the Principal, the bread will be sold to the school at a fair price and will be competitive in price from an outside bakery. The average cost of bread at this school in the past has been in the vicinity of $120.00 per month, and it will be interesting to note the cost next year. Although the bread had been supplied from this source since early in June, no accounts had been rendered to date of visit.\n\nThere were no items which could be classed as extraordinary expenditures during the year.\n\nInsurance premiums amounting to $756.06 were paid from School funds as in past years. The buildings are the property of the Jesuit Order, and in the event of a fire, undoubtedly the Jesuit Order would collect the insurance. The matter was discussed with the Principal. He explained to me that they were under agreement with the Department to withdraw $4,000.00 per year from School funds in lieu of salary for the members of the Order employed at the School. This has never been paid in full. During the last twelve months only $3,300.00 was withdrawn on account of salary, and the Principal felt that even by including the cost of insurance premiums the members of the Order were still underpaid. However, it would be better if the salaries were paid in full and the insurance premium paid from funds other than those of the School. The Principal agreed that the manner of financing in this respect was somewhat involved and he promised to consider this point in future.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.4.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on an expenditure of $25,294.50 for the year, less refunds and cash sales...\namounting to $1,010.97, or a net expenditure of $24,283.53.\n\nThe cost per pupil during the last year was $3.73 higher than the period covered in the previous report. The cost of clothing and food was slightly less.\n\nIncluded in the cost is the value of the food raised which amounts to $35.60 per pupil per year.\n\nThe average attendance during the year was 125 pupils and the quota is 125.\n\nStaff - Statement No.5\n\nThe principal supplied me with a list of the Staff employed at August 15th, 1941. According to the principal, Mr. Chaput, the carpenter, is only temporarily employed.\n\nLivestock and Crops\n\nAccording to the principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses, 15 milch cows, 34 head of young cattle, 1 bull, 9 pigs, and 200 hens.\n\nAccording to school records, the crop produced in 1940 consisted of 200 bushels of oats, 225 bushels of mixed grain, oats and barley, 73 tons of hay, 345 bags of potatoes, 8 tons of ensilage corn, 67 bushels of mangels and beets, 50 bushels of turnips and carrots. There was also a quantity of garden produce, the value of which was estimated at $229.40.\n\nA record was kept in the kitchen of the food produced and consumed during the twelve months under review and the value was shown as follows:\n\n| Item            | Value   |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Milk            | $1,611.30 |\n| Butter          | $97.80   |\n| Cream           | $21.40   |\n| Eggs and Poultry| $58.44   |\n| Beef            | $47.90   |\n| Pork            | $44.32   |\n| Potatoes        | $45.00   |\n| Garden Produce  | $238.40  |\n\n$4,492.56\n\nThe school property, owned by the Jesuits of Upper Canada, consists of approximately 1000 acres of which approximately 140 acres are considered arable. The remainder consists mostly of wood land. The school wood is cut from the school property.\n\nA farm was rented this year for which $50.00 was paid in rental. A fair crop of grain was expected to be harvested from this farm shortly after my visit.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records appeared to be in good order and recorded up to date.\n\nThe foregoing, to the best of my knowledge and...\nand belief and from the vouchers and records which have been placed at my disposal, is a true and complete statement of the condition of the accounts at the time of my audit. The Principal and the bookkeeper advised me that there were no outstanding accounts at July 31st, 1941.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by both Rev. J. Howitt, the Principal, and Brother O'Keefe, the bookkeeper, during the course of my visit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 471-24, part 1)\nOttawa, December 11th, 1942.\n\nL.W. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSpanish Indian Residential School for Boys\nRoman Catholic\nSpanish, Ontario.\n\nI submit herewith a report of an audit of the books and records at the above noted School, covering a period from August 1st, 1941 to July 31st, 1942.\n\nI commenced my examination on August 17th and completed it the next day.\n\nThe cash book was made up to July 31st, only. The Principal and the bookkeeper were away, but Father Hawkins, the assistant Principal was on hand and he was able to produce the books and records I needed.\n\nCash Book, Vouchers, Cheques, Etc.\n\nThe bank accounts are kept with the Royal Bank of Canada, Blind River, some thirty-five miles from Spanish. Two bank accounts are maintained, one Savings, and the other is a CURRENT account on which cheques are drawn. According to the bank pass books, which were written up to July 31st, the combined balance at that date was $2,053.58, against which there were six outstanding cheques totalling $161.17, leaving a net bank balance of $1,892.35. Cash on hand amounted to $166.28, therefore, the actual school balance was $2,058.65, which agreed with the cash book balance. - Statement No.1.\n\nThe paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book entries.\n\nThe vouchers were available and these were examined by test and the allocations in the cash book were verified.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements - Statement No.2.\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the cash book after I had completed my examination of the cheques and vouchers.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the twelve months under review amounted to $26,180.80, in which is included as \"contra\" the amount of $5,894.37 representing the estimated value of the food produced and consumed at the school.\nThe per capita grants received during the year amounted to $18,476.89. In addition a special grant of $1,153.00 for 1941 was received.\n\nThe farm and garden cash sales brought $120.66 only and are detailed on Statement No.2.\n\nThe receipts from other sources as shown on the statement are self-explanatory.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe total disbursements during the same period amounted to $27,448.10, in which is included as \"contra\" the value of the food raised and consumed at the school.\n\nI have prepared statement No.3, on which are detailed the most important items of expenditure.\n\nThere were no items which could be classed as extraordinary expenditures during the year.\n\nAs reported last year, the Jesuit Order operate a grist mill and a bakery on their property to supply the bread to the School. These have been in operation since June, 1941. The cost of bread during the year amounted to $1,613.77, in which is included an outstanding account of $190.99 at the time of my last visit. The net cost of bread for the year, therefore, would be $1,422.78, or an average monthly cost of $118.56. This compares with a monthly cost last year of $120.00. According to the Assistant Principal this arrangement is working very well and a better quality of bread is being supplied than formerly from outside bakeries.\n\nThere were no insurance premiums paid from School funds during the year. During the previous year the sum of $756.08 was paid. I mentioned the item last year and I suggested that as the buildings were the property of the Jesuit Order, it would seem reasonable to expect the order to pay the insurance premiums. The Principal agreed last year that the insurance premiums should be paid by the Jesuit Order and he promised to consider the matter in future. There was a change of Principal during the last summer and the new incumbent was absent when I visited the school.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.4.\n\nThe cost of operation is based on a net cost of $26,791.68 for the twelve month period, as compared with $24,283.53 for the previous year.\n\nThe average attendance was 127 pupils and on that basis the cost per pupil per year would be $210.36, as compared with $193.56 for the previous year or an increase of $16.80 per pupil.\n\nThe cost of clothing per pupil is shown at $6.01 which is a very low cost. It was explained that there was a surplus stock of yard goods on hand at the beginning of the period and that most of the clothing is tailored by the school staff and pupils.\nThe cost of food per pupil at $93.50 is very high but it includes the food raised at the school and this was estimated at $5,894.37 or $46.41 per pupil. This appears rather high, but apparently a complete record was kept in the kitchen and a record was kept of the following commodities produced:\n\n| Commodity          | Cost   |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Milk and cream     | $1,869.25 |\n| Poultry and eggs   | 918.25  |\n| Beef               | 845.36  |\n| Pork               | 332.46  |\n| Butter             | 657.15  |\n| Potatoes           | 718.75  |\n| Other vegetables   | 557.15  |\n\n$5,894.37\n\nStaff - Statement No.5\n\nThe assistant principal supplied me with the list of the staff employed at August 17th, 1942. The staff and the annual salaries are listed on the statement.\n\nLivestock and Crop.\n\nAccording to the assistant principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses; 55 cattle - 10 milking; 1 bull; 16 hogs; 150 hens and 450 pullets; 35 goats, including 3 kids.\n\nThe school records showed the following crop for 1941:\n\n- 80 tons of hay\n- 700 bushels of oats\n- 575 bags of potatoes\n- 500 bushels of roots - mangels and turnips\n- 515 \" carrots\n\ngarden produce valued at $557.15\n\nThe school property, owned by the Jesuits of Upper Canada, consists of approximately 1,000 acres of which only 140 acres are considered arable. The remainder consists mostly of woodland. The fuel wood for the school is cut from the school property.\n\nSome land is rented and a fair crop of grain was expected to be harvested this year.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records appeared to be in good condition and recorded up to July 31st, 1942.\n\nThe foregoing report, to the best of my knowledge and belief and from the vouchers and records which were placed at my disposal, is a true and complete statement of the condition of the accounts at the time of my audit.\n\nAs far as I could ascertain, there were no outstanding accounts at the close of July, 1942.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by Father Hawkins, the assistant principal, during the course of my audit.\n\nE.H.

Two bank accounts are maintained, one in savings and the other in a current account on which the cheques are drawn. According to the bank pass books, which were written up to August 14th, the combined bank balances amounted to $8,399.40. The outstanding cheques totalled $1,426.95, leaving a net bank balance of $6,972.44. Cash on hand amounted to $422.60; therefore, the actual school balance was $7,395.04, which agreed with the cash book - Statement No.1.\n\nThe paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book. The vouchers supporting the disbursements were examined by test. The postings in the cash book appeared to be properly allocated under the various headings of expenditures.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements - Statement No.2.\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the Synoptic Cash Book and covers a period of one year from August 17, 1941, to August 18, 1942.\n\nReceipts.\n\nThe total receipts during the period are shown as $24,603.52, in which is included the value of the food raised and consumed at the school. The amount, viz.: $3,360.63 is shown also as \"Contra\" under disbursements. The per capita grants received during the period totalled $18,419.11. In addition a special grant of $1,153.00 for 1941 was received.\n\nThe cash sales from Farm and Garden brought in $98.35 only.\n\nA record was kept of the produce from the Farm and Garden supplied to the kitchen, and these commodities are summarized.\nsummarized as follows:\n\n- Milk: 19,731 qts. @ .10 = $1,973.10\n- Eggs: 829 doz. @ .30 = $248.70\n- Butter: 285 lbs. @ .35 = $100.25\n- Meat: valued at = $216.14\n- Potatoes: 337 bags @ 1.00 = $337.00\n- Vegetables and Berries - valued at = $496.43\n\nTotal = $3,350.62\n\nThe receipts under \"Other Sources\" include an item of $1,131.36 received from the Boys' School in payment of laundry services, repairs of clothing, and also for some coal supplied to the school.\n\nThe other receipts are itemized on the statement and are self-explanatory.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe total disbursements during the same period amounted to $24,811.45, in which is included as \"Contra\" the value of the food produced and consumed at the school.\n\nI have prepared Statement No.3 which shows more in detail the most important items of disbursements under each heading.\n\nA new boiler was installed as replacement at a cost of $1,400.00.\n\nThe roof and the eaves had to be repaired at a cost of $350.90.\n\nThe other items appear about normal.\n\nFrom all appearances, this school is operated very economically and with a balance of $7,395.04 at August 18th, 1942, is in a very sound financial condition.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.4.\n\nThe cost of operation for the year is based on a net cost of $23,140.66. The average attendance for the year was 126.407 pupils and on that basis the cost per pupil per year would be $185.06, or an increase of $20.25 per pupil over the previous year.\n\nThe cost of clothing was reduced from $13.37 per pupil per year to $11.90.\n\nThe cost of food per pupil per year is shown as $76.23 as compared with $68.05 for the previous year. Included in the cost is the estimated value of the food produced and consumed and this worked out at $26.58 per pupil.\n\nStaff - Statement No.5.\n\nThe staff employed at August 19th is listed on Statement No.5. The information was supplied by the Principal and the annual salaries...\nsalaries are shown as $5,840.00. The sum of $5,889.40 was actually expended for salaries during the year under review. Provision is made for two teachers not yet engaged at the time of visit. The Principal expected to have the positions filled by September 1st.\n\nLivestock and Crop\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 2 horses, 6 milch cows, 3 young cattle, 150 hens, 4 hogs and 19 goats, including 6 kids.\n\nThere are only about 25 acres of land available for farming and most of the feed has to be bought.\n\nThe 1941 crop included 30 bushels of oats, 32 bushels of mangels and 4\u00bd tons of turnips, 337 bags of potatoes and a good crop of vegetables valued at $496.43.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records appeared to be recorded up to date and in excellent condition.\n\nThe foregoing report, to the best of my knowledge and belief and from the vouchers and records which were placed at my disposal, is a true and complete statement of the condition of the accounts at the time of my audit. As far as I could ascertain there were no outstanding accounts at August 19th, 1942.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by both the Principal and the bookkeeper during the course of my audit.\n\n[Signature]\n\nZ.H.

There were six\noutstanding cheques totalling $562.65, leaving a net bank\nbalance of $2,464.51. By adding $400.00 cash on hand the\nactual school balance was $3,064.53 at August 31, 1943 -\nStatement No.1.\n\nThe paid cheques were examined and checked to\nthe cash book.\n\nThe vouchers supporting the disbursements were\nexamined by test. Several errors were detected in the\nallocation of the charges in the synoptic. These were\nbrought to the attention of the Principal and the adjust-\nments were taken into account when preparing the attached\nfinancial statements.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements - Statement No.2.\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis\nof the synoptic covering the period under review.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the period amounted\nto $24,718.15, in which is included, as \"contra\" the value\nof the food produced and consumed at the school.\n\nThe per capita grants received during the\nperiod amounted to $15,692.80. In addition a special\ngrant of $1,153.00 for 1942 was received.\n\nThe cash sales from farm and garden brought\n$39.05 only.\n\nThe school records show the following commodities\nhaving been produced and received in the kitchen:\n\nMilk...\nMilk 19,203 qts @ .10 = $1,920.30\nEggs 921 doz @ .30 = 276.30\nButter 519 lbs @ .35 = 111.65\nMeat valued at = 137.35\nPotatoes 300 bags @ 1.25 = 375.00\nVegetables, berries, etc. = 398.62\n\n$3,213.29 -\n\nThe receipts under \"Other Sources\" include an item of $949.22 received from the Boys' School in payment for laundry services and repairs of clothing.\n\nThe school was re-imburged by the Department for repairs and pupils' fares.\n\nThe Boys' School sold Delco plant parts for $224.70 and one-half of the sale price was handed over to the Girls' School.\n\nSundry supplies amounting to $73.91 were sold to lay members of the staff.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe total disbursements during the same period amounted to $29,048.66, in which is included the amount of $3,213.29 as \"contra\" the value of the food raised and consumed at the school.\n\nI have prepared Statement No.3 which shows more in detail the most important items of expenditure under each heading.\n\nThe school purchased for cash from accumulated school funds approximately 100 acres of land adjoining the school property. The purchase price was $3,500.00, and an additional sum of $30.49 was expended for fees in connection with the searching of title and registrations. The land is registered in the name of St. Joseph's Indian Residential School. The Principal informed me that neither the Department nor the Principal of the Boys' School were consulted prior to the deal being made. There is a fairly good house, which was repaired recently by the school, and a stable on the property. The house is occupied by one of the farm hands. Approximately 35 acres is developed arable land and the remaining portion consists mostly of rough rough land, which there is considerable timber. The Principal explained that, as the original school property consisted of only 25 acres, a very small percentage of the feed needed for the livestock could be produced. With the additional land she feels they will be able to raise much more feed and to maintain a larger herd of cattle.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.4.\n\nThe statement shows comparative operating cost for the last two years.\n\nAs the purchase price of the farm is of a capital nature, I did not include that expenditure in the operating cost.\n\nIt will be noted that there is very little difference in the cost in the last two years. The cost per pupil per year shows an increase of $2.16. There is a slight reduction in the cost of clothing. Food cost shows an increase of $3.04 per pupil.\n\nStaff ...\nStaff - Statement No.51\n\nThe staff as listed on the statement was provided me by the Principal. The annual salaries of the staff presently employed amount to $6,300.00. The actual disbursement on account of salaries during the year amounted to $6,280.65.\n\nLivestock and Crop:\n\nAccording to the Principal the livestock consists of 2 horses; 7 milch cows; 4 heifers; 2 hogs; 160 poultry; and 7 goats, including 3 kids.\n\nThe crop in 1942 included 75 bushels of oats, 300 bags of potatoes, 4 tons of turnips and 6 bushels of mangles. There was also a good crop of other vegetables valued at $392.69. No hay was produced. The 1943 crop of grain had not been threshed. The potato crop this year was a complete failure due to the very wet season.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were recorded up to date and in very good condition.\n\nAs far as I could ascertain the accounts payable at August 31, 1943, totalled $1,707.46 of which $1,106.89 was paid early in September.

In addition a special grant of $1,153.00 for 1942 was received.\n\nThe farm and garden cash sales brought $355.23 and are detailed in the statement.\n\nThe receipts from other sources as detailed in the statement are self-explanatory.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe total disbursements during the year amounted to $26,766.24, including the contra amount of $6,290.03.\n\nI have prepared statement No.3, on which are detailed the most important items of expenditure.\n\nThe cost of clothing shows an increase of $329.00. The Principal believes that the cost will be reduced considerably in another year as he is in receipt of discarded military clothing which can be used to make clothes for the boys.\n\nThe cost of food shows an increase of $440.00 over last year. This is understandable as the prices on most food commodities have risen since last year.\n\nThe fuel cost shows a sharp reduction as there was no expenditure on this account during the year, as compared with $976.49 for previous year. Considerable fuel was cut from school property and there were outstanding accounts of $425.00 for fuel at August 31st.\n\nThe buildings and repairs cost shows an increase of $420.00 over the previous year. Considerable interior painting was done on the store and stable. The paint cost $199.97. Builder's supplies, including lumber cost $25.15. The Department reimbursed the school an amount of $449.84 for buildings and repairs, including $111.07 for a goat house.\n\nThe cost of farm and garden shows a decrease of $1,600.00 over the previous year. The following reductions were noted:\n\n| Item     | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Feed     | $913.64|\n| Seed     | $53.11 |\n| Cattle   | $498.25|\n| Fertilizer| $226.35|\n\n$1,691.33\n\nThe .....\nThe cost of transport, freight and express shows an increase of $538.87, which is made up as follows:\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Gas and oil   | $114.99|\n| Repairs       | $36.25 |\n| Transportation | $394.62|\n|               | $546.44|\n| Less decrease - Freight and Express | $7.57 |\n|               | $538.87|\n\nThe cost of extra labour shows an increase of $327.81.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.4\n\nThis statement shows a comparative cost in the last two years. It will be noted that there was a slight decrease in the last year in the general cost per pupil.\n\nThe cost of food is high, but it includes the estimated value of the food produced and consumed at the school. The school records show the following commodities having been produced and received in the kitchen:\n\n| Commodity     | Quantity | Value   |\n|---------------|----------|---------|\n| Milk          | 6150 gals.| $2,133.35|\n| Cream         | 284 lbs. | $57.00  |\n| Butter        | 1264 lbs.| $454.14 |\n| Poultry & Eggs|          | $984.63 |\n| Beef          | 6243 lbs.| $1,120.86|\n| Pork          | 2117 lbs.| $423.40 |\n| Goat          | 130 lbs. | $6.50   |\n| Potatoes      | 450 bags | $787.50 |\n| Other vegetables valued at | $322.65 | $6,290.03 |\n\nStaff - Statement No.5\n\nThe Principal provided me with the list of the staff as listed on the statement. The annual salaries being paid at present would amount to $6,976.00 per annum. The salaries paid during the year amounted to $6,552.74. Considerable difficulty was experienced during the year to have the service of a chef. A chef was engaged recently and the salary had to be increased.\n\nLivestock and Crop:\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock consists of 7 horses; 63 head of cattle, including 14 milch cows, 46 steers and heifers and 3 bulls; 15 hogs; 600 poultry; and 22 goats, including 4 kids.\n\nThe school records showed the following crop for 1942:\n\n- 1100 bushels of oats\n- 115 tons of hay\n- 450 bags of potatoes\n\nThe 1943 grain had not been threshed and a poor crop was expected due to the wet season. The hay crop was...\nwas fair but most of it was spoiled by the weather. The potato crop was affected by blight and only 270 bags were harvested.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were found in good order and posted to August 31, 1943.\n\nAs far as I could ascertain accounts payable on hand at August 31, totalled $2,285.15.\n\nThe foregoing report, to the best of my knowledge and belief, based upon the papers and records which were placed at my disposal, is a true and complete statement of the condition of the accounts at the time of my audit.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by both the Principal and the bookkeeper during the course of my audit.\n\nE.H.

The unrepresented cheques totalled $610.85 less the net balance of $3,506.55 on hand amounted to $3,500.00; therefore, the actual school balance was $3,506.55, which agreed with the cash book balance. In addition there is a victory bond for $50.00. At the beginning of the period there was an unpaid loan of $1,000.00 due the community. During the past year an additional $2,000.00 was borrowed and repaid leaving $1,000.00 still due the community.\n\nThe paid cheques issued during the period under review were examined and checked to the synoptic cash book entries.\n\nThe vouchers supporting the payments were examined by test and the allocations of the charges in the synoptic were verified. These appeared to be made correctly.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements - Statement No.2.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the year amounted to $31,329.26, in which is included as \"contra\" the item of $4,675.43 representing the estimated value of the food produced at the school and received in the kitchen.\n\nThe cash sales from the Farm and Garden amounted to $71.07 only.\nThe school records show the following commodities having been produced and received in the kitchen:\n\n- Milk: 27,694 qts @ .10 = $2,769.95\n- Eggs: 1,275 doz @ .30 = $382.50\n- Butter: 1,197 lbs @ .38 = $455.05\n- Meat - Poultry, Veal & Pork: 287.25\n- Potatoes: 212 bags @ 1.75 = $371.00\n- Vegetables and berries valued at $409.50\n\nTotal: $4,675.43\n\nThe receipts from \"Other Sources\" amounted to $1,479.68 in which is included an item of $929.33 received from the Boys' School in payment of laundry services.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe total disbursements during the year, including the \"contra\" item of $6,675.43 and the repayment of the $2,000.00 loan, amounted to $31,580.49.\n\nThe following statement shows the comparative cost under each heading for the last two years:\n\n| Item                  | 1944-45   | 1945-46   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Salaries              | 7,078.23  | 8,455.37  |\n| Clothing              | 1,706.64  | 1,870.55  |\n| Food - Purchased      | 7,333.95  |           |\n| - Raised              | 4,566.60  |           |\n| Phone, Fuel, Light & Water | 11,900.55 | 11,675.43 |\n| Buildings and Repairs | 7,162.69  | 1,588.56  |\n| House Equipment       | 1,281.28  | 1,221.35  |\n| Fares and Garden      | 1,098.79  | 1,688.37  |\n| Transport, Freight & Express | 307.90    | 269.51    |\n| Extra Labour          | 587.20    | 662.38    |\n| Miscellaneous         | 165.82    | 187.76    |\n| Repayment of loan     | 27,756.86 | 29,580.49 |\n|                       | 2,500.00  | 2,000.00  |\n| Total                 | $30,256.86| $31,580.49|\n\nI have prepared Statement No.3 which shows more in detail the most important items of expenditure under each heading of the synoptic.\n\nThe cost of salaries shows an increase of $1,380.14.

The unpresented cheques totalled $618.58 leaving a net bank balance of $5,432.71. Cash on hand amounted to $500.00; therefore, the actual school balance was $5,932.71. In addition there is a Victory bond for $50.00. During the period a $1,000.00 community loan was paid.\n\nThe paid cheques issued during the period under review were examined and checked to the synoptic cash book entries.\n\nThe vouchers supporting the payments were examined by test and the allocations of the charges in the synoptic were verified. The payments appeared to be made correctly. Some allocations appeared to be wrong and an effort was made to assign the payments to the proper accounts.\n\nRECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS\n\nThe total receipts during the year amounted to $33,964.35, in which is included as \"Contra\" the item of $4,823.27 representing the estimated value of the food produced at the school and received in the kitchen.\n\nThe cash sales from the Farm and Garden amounted to $200.00 only.\n\nThe school records show the following commodities having been produced and received in the kitchen:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Value |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Milk                  | 2560 lbs | @ 10\u00a2      | $2,560.00   |\n| Eggs                  | 1025     | @ 25\u00a2      | $256.25     |\n| Butter                | 1115 lbs | @ 1\u00bd       | $157.15     |\n| Meat-Poultry, Veal, Pork & Beef |          |            | $275.60     |\n| Potatoes              | 600 Bags | @ $1.00    | $600.00     |\n| Vegetables and berries valued at |          |            | $390.92     |\n\n$4,823.27\n\nThe receipts...........\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will be observed, however, that the total cost for the eleven months is about equal to the twelve-months cost for the previous year. Phone, fuel, and extra labour show the greatest increase over the previous year.\n\nCOST OF OPERATION - STATEMENT #3\n\nThis statement shows a comparative cost for the last two years.

This was primarily due to the fact that the average attendance was 2075 pupils greater last year than the year previous (117.13 to 126.4). The salary expenses were considerably greater than the amount paid the religious teachers, receiving approximately $5,350.00 more, while the lay teachers and domestics received over $1,000.00 more. In order to obtain teachers the school has been obliged to increase the rate of pay. The curriculum included manual training instruction as well as second year high school subjects.\n\nLivestock and Crops\n\nAccording to the Principal the livestock consists of 18 milch cows; 31 young cattle; 12 calves; 1 bull; 7 large pigs; 6 small pigs and poultry valued at $200.00.\n\nThe crop raised last year included 120 tons of hay; 570 bags of potatoes; and garden produce valued at $1,341.90.\n\nStaff - Statement #3\n\nThe list of staff and the rates of salary were provided by the Principal.

(RG 10, Volume 6210, file 472-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red Lake Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated January 3rd, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nJAN 8 1942\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [December 31, 1941].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [January 3rd, 1942]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Sioux Lookout]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Macleod Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\nthis APR 8, 1942\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Macdonald Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institution Name] School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated July 6, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at this Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 11, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSioux Lookout\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCT 13 1942\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 8, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: JAN 8, 1943\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at this\n\nAPR 1, 1943\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average Attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 5, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, July 13, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: OCT 7, 1943\n\nthis: Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended: September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at:\n\nOCT 7\n\nthis.\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 6th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Indian Agency]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institutional Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, APR 4, 1944\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.405\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 6, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, July 6, 1944\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 409\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When referring to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institution Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nthis OCT. 13, 1944\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McLurkin Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [McIntosh Lake Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 3rd 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nthis [JAN 5 1945]\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institutional Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated January 3rd 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 2nd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this APR 2nd, 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted School] School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 1st, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils in residence during quarter, excluding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nOCT 5 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRepu.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 2nd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: JAN 2 1946\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institution Name] School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated February 3rd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\nDated at: JAN 8 1946\nthis: Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, April 4, 1946\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORAR No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: SIoux LOOKOUT\n\nthis JULY 5, 1946\n\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the M.C. Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 7, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SOUX LOOKOUT OCT 9, 1946\n\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Mr. C. E. Conran\n\nDated: Sept. Oct. 7, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nSIOUX LOOKOUT\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: E.E. Corriveau\n\nDated: Jan 8th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSIOUX LOOKOUT\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: FEB 4 1947\n\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIvor Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: C. B. Corrigan\n\nDated: Jan 8th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSIoux LOOKOUT\n\nFEB 4 1947\n\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Mc Donogh Ind Res School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1947 19.\n\nPrincipal C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated APR 9 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout APR 16 1947\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReqn.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [McGillivray Ind.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APR 9 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Me Autoch Ond Res School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1947 19\n\nPrincipal L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal: \n\nDated: JUL 10 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Lake School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1947 19...\n\nPrincipal: E.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McInnis School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 20, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this OCT. 23, 1947.\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McInnis Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 20, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this OCT. 23, 1947.\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 29, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 405\nReq.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McNICHOL INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1948 19\n\nPrincipal C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MONTOSH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1948 19 Principal\n\nDated APR 12 1948 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this APR 12 1948 19 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McINTOSH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JUL 6 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSIoux I.C.O.N.O.T\n\nDated at this INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance-in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MINTOSH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1948\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN - 7 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MINTOSH, ONT., School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JUN 30 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout Agency**\n\n| HEIGHT NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAY OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n|               |                 |     |     |                |                   |                         |                           |            |\n| 0140          | Ruth Evelyn Tanesco | 13  | 1   | Golden Lake    | 7                 | #

You have shown the reason for the discrepancy but failed to show the dates involved.\n\nThe Auditors and the Treasury Branch insist that where pupils are in residence for less than the prescribed number of days, the reason and the dates of absence should be shown in the remarks column.\n\nWould you kindly supply the information for these two cases and keep them in mind when completing future returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C.E. Comeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nMcIntosh Indian Res., School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.,\n\nMFT/HM\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.
